<p><strong><a name="question1"></a>
            Who created the Interstate System?</strong></p>
<p>
            The concept of an Interstate system as we know it was first
            described in a 1939 report to Congress called <i>Toll Roads and
            Free Roads</i>.  The report rejected the toll superhighway
            network Congress had suggested; revenue from tolls on most segments
            would not support the bonds issued for their construction. 
            However, the report added that the country needed a toll-free
            express highway network.  Thomas H. MacDonald, Chief of the
            U.S. Bureau of Public Roads, and Herbert S. Fairbank, Chief of the
            agency's Division of Information, prepared the report. 
            The ideas expressed in the "free roads" portion of the
            report evolved through further study and experience before approval
            of the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>, but the Interstate System
            began with MacDonald and Fairbank.         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question2"></a> Why is President Dwight D. Eisenhower called the "Father of
            the Interstate System"? </strong></p>
<p>
            Although the<em> Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944</em> authorized designation
            of a "National System of Interstate Highways," the
            legislation did not authorize an initiating program to build
            it.  After taking office in January 1953, President Eisenhower
            made revitalizing the Nation's highways one of the goals of
            his first term.  As an army Lieutenant Colonel in 1919,
            Eisenhower had accompanied a military convoy across the United States and
            saw the poor condition of our Nation's roads.  Later,
            during his World War II stint as Commander of the Allied Forces,
            his admiration for Germany's well-engineered Autobahn highway
            network reinforced his belief that the United States needed first-class
            roads.  As a result, Eisenhower formed internal committees to
            study the idea, enlisted the Nation's Governors to offer
            suggestions, and met with Members of Congress to promote the
            proposal.  When legislation failed in 1955, observers
            predicted that in the presidential election year of 1956, the
            Democratic Congress would not approve such a significant plan
            sought by a Republican President.  Nevertheless, President
            Eisenhower continued to urge approval and worked with Congress to
            reach compromises that made approval possible.  The President
            signed the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em> on June 29, 1956.          </p>
<p>
            Through the remainder of his years as President, he searched for
            ways to solve the problems that plagued the program in its early
            years and pushed for continued work on the Interstate System. 
            His leadership in promoting the <em>1956 Act</em> and moving the program
            forward on schedule has earned President Eisenhower the title
            "Father of the Interstate System."         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p>
<a name="question3"></a><strong>How long is the Interstate System?</strong> </p>
<p>
            Currently, the Interstate System is 46,876 miles long.  The
            <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em> imposed a statutory limitation on
            the Interstate mileage that would be built with Interstate
            Construction funds under the new program (41,000 miles at the
            time). Later legislation increased the limitation to 43,000 miles,
            of which a total of 42,795 miles has been used.  Separate
            legislation allows the Federal Highway Administration to approve
            additional mileage if it meets full Interstate standards and would
            be a logical addition or connection.  Beyond the 42,795 miles,
            this additional mileage is not "chargeable"—that
            is, it is not eligible for Interstate Construction funds under the
            <em>1956 Act</em>, as amended, although the State may use other Federal-aid
            funds to help with construction.          </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question4"></a>
            Who built the Interstate System?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The Interstate System was built under the principles of the
            Federal-aid highway program, which was established in 1916. 
            The Federal Government made Interstate Construction funds available
            to the State highway/transportation agencies, which built the
            Interstates. 
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question5"></a>
            Who owns it?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The States own and operate the Interstate highways. 
         </p>
<p>
            The one exception is the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge (I-95/495)
            over the Potomac River in the Washington area.  The U.S.
            Bureau of Public Roads built the bridge under special legislation
            approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in August 1954. 
            Although the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia operate
            the bridge, it is owned by the Federal Highway
            Administration.  When the first span of the replacement
            bridge, now under construction, is opened, the old bridge will be
            removed.  The States will own the new Woodrow Wilson Memorial
            Bridge.
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question6"></a>
            What did it cost?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The final estimate of the cost of the Interstate System was issued
            in 1991.  It estimated that the total cost would be $128.9
            billion, with a Federal share of $114.3 billion.  This
            estimate covered only the mileage (42,795 miles) built under the
            Interstate Construction Program.  It excluded turnpikes
            incorporated into the Interstate System within the mileage
            limitation and the mileage added as a logical addition or
            connection outside the limitation but financed without Interstate
            Construction funds. 
         </p>
<p>
            In all, Federal-aid legislation authorized a total of $119 billion
            to pay the Federal share of the cost of Interstate
            construction.  (Interstate Construction funds were authorized
            through Fiscal Year 1996.)  
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question7"></a>
            Why does the Federal Government pay 90 percent of the cost?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944</em> authorized designation of a
            40,000-mile "National System of Interstate Highways,"
            but did not establish a program or special funding for its
            construction.  The first such funding came under the
            <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1952</em>, which authorized a token amount of
            $25 million a year for the Interstate System in Fiscal Years (FY)
            1954 and 1955.  The <em>1952 Act</em> retained the standard matching
            ratio (Federal share: 50 percent).  The <em>Federal-Aid Highway
            Act of 1954</em> authorized $175 million a year for the Interstate
            System (FYs 1956 and 1957), with a Federal-State matching ratio of
            60-40.  The increased Federal share reflected the common
            understanding that the Interstate System is vitally important to
            national goals.            </p>
<p>
            As President Dwight D. Eisenhower began to promote creation of a
            program to build the Interstate Construction Program, the
            Nation's Governors made clear to him that they did not want
            to be forced to increase State taxes to pay the additional matching
            funds for the national program.  Therefore, the President
            proposed to increase funds for the Interstate System, while
            boosting the Federal share to 90 percent.  Under his proposal,
            the States would continue paying the same amount in matching funds
            for the Interstate System that they had been paying under the 1954
            Act.  When the program took shape in the Federal-Aid Highway
            Act of 1956, it differed in some ways from the President's
            proposal, particularly with regard to the source of funding for the
            program, but Congress retained the Federal-State matching share of
            90-10 as a reflection of the Interstate Construction
            Program's importance to national goals.  (In the western
            States with large amounts of untaxed public land, the Federal share
            could be increased to 95 percent.)

            Did construction of the Interstate System contribute to the
            national debt?         </strong></p>
<p>
            President Eisenhower insisted that the financing mechanism for the
            Interstate System be "self-liquidating," so that it
            could not add to the national debt.  The president favored a
            toll highway network financed by bonds, but his aides convinced him
            that traffic volumes would not generate enough revenue in most
            corridors to repay bondholders with interest.  Therefore, the
            plan the President submitted to Congress called for establishment
            of a Federal Highway Corporation to issue bonds to pay for the
            Interstate System up-front, with the Federal excise tax on gasoline
            and lubricating oil (which then went to the general Treasury
            without a linkage to highways) was dedicated to bond
            retirement.  Congress rejected this plan, but adopted a
            proposal to finance the Interstate System on a pay-as-you-go basis
            with revenue from highway user taxes.  The revenue was
            credited by the Department of the Treasury to the Highway Trust
            Fund established under the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>.         </p>
<p>
            The Interstate Construction Program, like the Federal-aid highway
            program of which it is a part, operates on a reimbursement
            basis.  After FHWA authorizes a State to proceed with a
            project, the State pays the bills for eligible activities, and then
            submits bills to the FHWA, which reimburses the State for the
            Federal share.  The FHWA makes a commitment (or
            "obligation") to reimburse the Federal share, but
            Interstate development takes several years.  As a result, the
            FHWA obligation results in reimbursements to the State for the
            Federal share over several years.  The <em>1956 Act</em> included a
            provision named after Senator Harry Flood Byrd (D-VA), the Chairman
            of the Senate Finance Committee, to ensure the Highway Trust Fund
            would contain enough money to pay the bills.  If sufficient
            funds are not available, the program must be reduced
            administratively in proportion to the imbalance.          </p>
<p>
            The Highway Trust Fund financing mechanism established in the <em>1956
            Act</em> satisfied President Eisenhower's
            "self-liquidating" demand.  As a result,
            construction of the Interstate System did not contribute to a
            Federal deficit.         </p>
<p>
            (In 1982, the Highway Trust Fund was divided into a Highway Account
            and a Transit Account, which also receives some highway user tax
            revenue.)

<p><strong><a name="question9"></a>Why did it cost so much more than expected?</strong>
</p>
<p>
            During debate leading up to the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>,
            Congress used an estimate of $27 billion.  This estimate was
            flawed in several ways.  It was based on a report by the U.S.
            Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), which covered only the 37,700 miles
            designated in 1947.  The BPR estimated that to build this
            mileage in 10 years to meet 1974 traffic needs would cost $23.2
            billion, based on midyear 1954 prices.  Second, President
            Eisenhower's Advisory Committee on a National Highway Program
            under General Lucius D. Clay (Rt.)—known as the "Clay
            Committee"—added only $4 billion for urban feeders and
            collectors, bringing the total to $27.2 billion.  Considering
            that the BPR had assumed urban-rural costs for the mileage
            designated in 1947 would be split $12.5 billion-$10.7 billion, and
            that an additional 2,300 miles of urban routes had been designated
            in 1955, the Clay Committee's estimate was flawed.         </p>
<p>
            Beyond the errors in the initial estimate, the <em>1956 Act</em> added 1,000
            miles to the Interstate System.  The <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act
            of 1968</em> added 1,500 miles, and subsequent legislation increased the
            mileage as well.  In addition, design standards were stricter
            beginning in 1956, and compliance with essential environmental
            requirements enacted in the 1960s added to the cost of
            projects.  As might be expected, inflation was a major factor
            as well.          </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question10"></a>What was the first Interstate?</strong>
</p>
<p>
            On August 2, 1947, the Federal Works Administrator, Major General
            Philip B. Fleming, approved the first 37,700 miles of the
            Interstate System recommended by Commissioner of Public Roads
            Thomas H. MacDonald.  Although Congress had not established a
            program to build the network, the States used Federal-aid primary
            funds to build many projects in the designated Interstate
            corridors. 
         </p>
<p>
            With the approval of the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>, the 
            formal Interstate Construction Program began, with higher design
            standards, a funding program, and a national commitment..  Two
            States can claim the first project, depending on how
            "first" is defined.         </p>
<p>
            The first project to go to construction with Interstate
            Construction funds under the <em>1956 Act</em> was in Missouri.  The
            project on U.S. 40 (later designated the I-70 Mark Twain
            Expressway) in St. Charles County got underway on August 13,
            1956.  Officials erected a sign stating, "This is the
            first project in the United States on which actual construction was
            started under provisions of the new <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of
            1956</em>."          </p>
<p>
            Kansas had begun a construction project on U.S. 40 (I-70) west of
            Topeka before the 1956 Act, but awarded the final paving contract
            under the new legislation.  Because this was the first paving
            under the <em>1956 Act</em>, Kansas erected a sign claiming, "This is
            the first project in the United States completed under provisions
            of the new <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>."         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question11"></a>When did the program end?</strong>
</p>
<p>
            It didn't.  The program authorized by the<em> Federal-Aid
            Highway Act of 1956</em> includes one last piece of Interstate that is
            likely to be built under the terms of the <em>1956 Act</em>.  It is a
            connection north of Philadelphia to close the last gap in
            I-95.  The project involves an I-95 interchange with the
            Pennsylvania Turnpike and an additional bridge over the Delaware
            River parallel to the existing bridge.  Review of the proposed
            project under the <em>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</em> has
            been completed and detailed design is underway.          </p>
<p>
            In addition, States continue to develop routes outside the <em>1956 Act</em>         program that may be added to the Interstate System under existing
         legislation or that have been or will be declared "future
            Interstates" by Federal legislation.         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p>
<a name="question12"></a><strong>Who sets traffic rules
            on the Interstate System?</strong> </p>
<p>
            Because the States own and operate the Interstates, the States
            establish the operating requirements, such as speed limits. 
            The States also are responsible for enforcement.
         </p>
<p>
            The National Committee on Uniform Traffic Laws and Ordinances
            (NCUTLO), which includes State motor vehicle administrators and
            police officers, publishes a compendium of model traffic laws and
            rules of the road.  The goal of NCUTLO is to promote
            uniformity across the States, but each State is free to adopt its
            own traffic laws and rules based on its unique circumstances. 
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question13"></a>
            What happened to the 55 mph Federal speed limit?         </strong></p>
<p>
            There never was a national speed limit of 55 mph.  The States
            determine speed limits. 
         </p>
<p>
            The impression of a "national speed limit" stems from
            the <em>Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act</em>, which President
            Richard M. Nixon signed on January 2, 1974.  In the midst of
            an energy crisis touched off by conflict in the Middle East and a
            subsequent oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Petroleum
            Exporting Countries that forced Americans into long lines at gas
            stations, the <em>Act</em> was part of a nationwide effort to reduce oil
            consumption.  The law prohibited the Federal Highway
            Administration from approving highway projects in any State having
            a maximum speed limit over 55 mph.  The States could retain
            higher speed limits if they wished, but at the cost of losing
            Federal-aid highway funding.  As a result, all States complied
            with the legislation.          </p>
<p>
            The <em>Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of
            1987</em> allowed the States to increase speeds to 65 mph on rural
            Interstate routes without penalty.  The <em>National Highway
            System Designation Act of 1995</em> extended the authority to all
            roads.  The States now have full control of speed
            limits.           </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question14"></a>
            Is the left lane for higher speeds?         </strong></p>
<p>
            Although the left lanes of multi-lane freeways are widely viewed as
            the "high speed lanes" or "the fast lanes,"
            <strong></strong>the speed limit applies to all lanes on any given street or
            highway.  The intent is that vehicles going slower than the
            posted speed limit should stay to the right.
         </p>
<p>
<a name="question15"></a><strong>Why are bicycles
            prohibited from using the Interstate shoulders?</strong> </p>
<p>
            Each State establishes the operating rules that determine which
            vehicles are allowed on the Interstate highways under their
            jurisdiction.  Most States do not allow bicyclists on the
            Interstate shoulders, but bicycle use is permitted in some States,
            particularly in the west where there is less traffic and where good
            alternative routes may not exist for bicycles.  Determining if
            bicycle access should be permitted is done only after careful study
            and consideration of how bicyclists and motor vehicle traffic can
            safely negotiate on- and off-ramps.  The safety of all roadway
            users must be considered.  In addition, some Interstate
            highways, mainly in urban areas, have been built with bicycle
            paths.   
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p>
<a name="question16"></a><strong>Are the Interstates really safer?</strong>
</p>
<p>
            One of the primary reasons for building the Interstate System was
            to improve the safety of the highway users: drivers, passengers,
            and pedestrians.  Over the past 50 years, the Interstate
            System has done much to make highway travel safer and more
            efficient.  Relative safety is measured by the "fatality
            rate" (fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, a measure
            used so data can be compared as traffic volumes change).  The
            Interstate System is the safest road system in the country, with a
            fatality rate of 0.8—compared with 1.46 for all roads in
            2004. 
         </p>
<p>
            When the Interstate Construction Program began in 1956, the
            national fatality rate was 6.05.  This improvement in safety
            has been the result of many factors working together:  the
            shifting of traffic onto the safer Interstate highways and
            technological advances in safety, such as wider shoulders;
            slid-resistant pavements; better guardrail, sign, and markings;
            clearer sight distances; and breakaway sign posts and utility
            poles.  In addition, many other factors have contributed to
            improved safety on the Nation's highway system, including new
            vehicle safety features, such as shatter proof glass, padded
            interiors, safety belts and air bags; programs to reduce impaired
            driving; and the combined, coordinated efforts of many private
            organizations and public agencies working together to make the
            Nation's highways ever safer.

<a name="question17"></a><strong>Why don't you put metric speed and
            distance signs on the Interstate System?</strong> </p>
<p>In the 1970's, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  considered converting highway signs, such as speed limit signs, to metric units  of measurement. After the proposal was made public, the agency received an  unusually high number of commentsâ€”more than 5,000 comments, about 98 percent of  which were negative. The idea was dropped.</p>
<p>The recent effort to convert the country to metric units  of measurement dates to the <em>Omnibus  Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988</em>, which requires all Federal  Agencies to use metric units in their procurements, grants, and other  business-related activities except to the extent that it is impractical or  likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to U.S. firms.  Based on this requirement, the FHWA reconsidered the subject of sign  conversion, but the public reaction was again overwhelmingly negative. To  avoid a public backlash against metric conversion, the FHWA issued a policy  statement in April 1994 indicating that the FHWA would not pursue sign  conversion. The following year, the <em>National  Highway System Designation Act of 1995 </em>prohibited the Secretary  from requiring the States to use Federal-aid highway or State funds "to  construct, erect, or otherwise place or to modify any sign relating to a speed  limit, distance, or other measurement on a highway for the purpose of having  such sign establish such speed, limit, distance, or other measurement using the  metric system." Under current law, a State may, if it chooses, use  Federal-aid funds to include metric measurements on distance or speed signs,  but none is doing so as of late 2018.</p>

<p><strong><a name="question18"></a>
            Who numbered the Interstates?         </strong></p>
<p>
            Following enactment of the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>,
            officials of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) and the American
            Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) agreed that AASHO
            should apply numbers to the Interstate System, as it did to the
            U.S. numbered highways.  In fact, the numbering plan for U.S.
            numbered highways was the model for the Interstate System—but
            in mirror image (for example, U.S. 1 is on the East Coast, while
            I-5 is on the West Coast; U.S. 10 is in the north while I-10 is in
            the south).  With basic guidelines in hand, AASHO's
            Executive Secretary, A. E. "Alf" Johnson, applied
            numbers to the Interstate map.  His handiwork was approved by
            AASHO's Route Numbering Subcommittee and Executive Committee
            and adopted by the BPR in September 1957.          </p>
<p>
            Because the States own the Interstates, cooperation with AASHO (and
            its successor, the American Association of State Highway and
            Transportation Officials [AASHTO]) in the numbering of Interstates
            has continued.  However, under Title 23, Code of Federal
            Regulations, Subsection 470.115(a) ("Approval
            authority"), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has
            the ultimate authority to approve/disapprove Interstate route
         numbers: </p>
<blockquote><em>The Federal Highway Administration will approve Federal-aid highway
            system actions involving the designation, or revision, of routes on
            the Interstate System, including route numbers, future Interstate
         routes, and routes on the National Highway System.</em></blockquote>
<p> In view of the Federal-State partnership, the State transportation
            departments submit applications to AASHTO when new numbers are
            needed or numbering changes are desired.  AASHTO submits the
            applications to the FHWA, which informs AASHTO of its
            position.  AASHTO then acts on the proposal, consistent with
            the FHWA's action.  If disagreement were to occur on a
            numbering proposal, the FHWA and AASHTO would resolve the issue
            before AASHTO acted.</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question19"></a> Why doesn't the Interstate System have an I-50? </strong></p>
<p>
            The Interstate numbering plan was based on the plan used to number
            the U.S. numbered highways, but in mirror image (for example, U.S.
            1 is on the East Coast, while I-5 is on the West Coast; U.S. 10 is
            in the north while I-10 is in the south).  In both plans,
            numbers ending in zero are used for transcontinental and other
            major multi-State routes.  However, one of the rules for
            Interstate numbering is that numbers are not duplicated on
            Interstate highways and U.S. numbered routes in the same
            State.  Duplicate numbers would be confusing for motorists;
            for example, if told to take "Route 50," the motorist
            might follow the wrong one.  Because the Interstate numbering
            plan is a mirror image of the U.S. numbered highway plan, I-50
            would be located in some of the same States as U.S. 50 (Ocean City,
            Maryland, to Sacramento, California).  Therefore,
            "50" has not been used for an Interstate route.
         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="question20"></a> I-99 is out of sequence—what can be done about it? </strong></p>
<p>
            Although State and Federal officials normally select Interstate
            route numbers, Congress made the choice of "99" for
            upgraded U.S. 220 in Pennsylvania.  Section 322 of the
            <em>National Highway System Designation Act of 1995</em> states that the
            specified section of U.S. 220 ". . . is designated as
            Interstate Route I-99."  Therefore, only a statutory
            revision can change the number.         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><a name="question21"></a><strong>Why don't you correct inconsistencies in numbering? </strong></p>
<p>
            Although Federal and State officials try to be consistent in
            Interstate System numbering, an occasional inconsistency is
            inevitable in a complicated, evolving network.  They cause
            little difficulty for the traveling public.  Most motorists
            are not aware of the numbering pattern; when driving in areas with
            which they are unfamiliar, motorists choose routes based on maps,
            signs, or directions received along the way.

            Who designed the Interstate shield?         </strong></p>
<p>
            Following enactment of the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>, the
            American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) asked State
            highway officials to suggest designs for an Interstate
            marker.  Dozens of proposals were submitted.  The best
            were displayed along a road when State highway officials attended a
            meeting in Illinois so they could observe the signs in
            different  situations, such as day and night.  Based on
            the officials' observations, AASHO's Route Numbering
            Subcommittee adopted the design submitted by Texas, with the
            addition of the word "Interstate" as proposed by the
            Missouri design for the top portion of the shield.  It was

<p><strong><a name="question23"></a> What is the story behind the "Eisenhower Interstate
            System" signs—and why don't all the States put
            them up? </strong></p>
<p>
On October 15, 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed Public Law 
              101-427 changing the official name of the Interstate System to
            honor the President who did so much to bring it about.  Based
            on an amendment in the <em>Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
            Act of 1991</em> (ISTEA), it is now called the Dwight D. Eisenhower
            National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. 
</p>
<p>
            Section 6012 of ISTEA directed the Secretary of Transportation to
            determine an appropriate system or emblem to be placed on
            Interstate highway signs to commemorate the former
            President's vision.  In conducting the study, the
            Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) created a partnership with
            the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
            Officials (AASHTO) and representatives of the Eisenhower family,
            the Eisenhower Center, and the Eisenhower Society (collectively,
            the Eisenhower group). 
</p>
<p>
            After considering over 50 designs submitted by AASHTO member States
            and FHWA employees, a committee of the partners selected three
            designs and forwarded them to AASHTO and the Eisenhower group for
            comment.  At a meeting of its Executive Committee, AASHTO
            indicated its preference for one design, recommending only a minor
            color change.  The Eisenhower group, working independently of
            AASHTO, recommended the same design.  The FHWA, which accepted
            the two independent decisions, altered the color on the preferred
            design and made some other minor improvements.  The sign was
            described in a report submitted to Congress on January 14,
            1993:  "The official symbol commemorating the vision of
            President Eisenhower in creating the Dwight D. Eisenhower
            [National] System of Interstate and Defense Highways [will] be a
            36-inch by 36-inch square blue sign, with five silver stars in a
            circle on the upper half of the sign, and the words EISENHOWER
            INTERSTATE SYSTEM in white on a lower half of the sign."
         </p>
<p>
            The sign was unveiled in the Mike Mansfield Room of the U.S.
            Congress on July 29, 1993.  Participants included Senators Bob
            Dole (R-KS), Max Baucus (D-MT), and John Chafee (R-RI);
            Representatives Norman Y. Mineta (D-CA), Nick J. Rahall (D-WV), and
            Bud Shuster (R-PA); members of the Eisenhower family including
            President Eisenhower's son John Eisenhower, and granddaughter
            Susan Eisenhower; and Federal Highway Administrator Rodney E.
            Slater. 
         </p>
<p>
            The State transportation departments may use regular Federal-aid
            highway funds, which are made available to the States on a formula
            basis, to install Eisenhower Interstate System signs. 
            However, each State determines whether to install them.  As a
            result, motorists will see the signs in some States, but not in
            others.
         </p>

<p><a name="question23a"></a><strong>Was President Eisenhower really surprised to discover that the Interstate System included urban freeways?</strong></p>
<p>The urban freeways were an important element of the Interstate System from its unveiling in the 1939 report to Congress: <em>Toll Roads and Free Roads</em>.  During congressional hearings in 1955 and 1956, Mayors and municipal associations testified in favor of the Interstate System because of the benefits the cities expected to receive from urban highway segments.  In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads had published<em> General Location of National System of Interstate Highways</em> in September 1955 with 100 pages of maps showing the urban Interstates.  This publication—known as the Yellow Book because of the color of its cover—was distributed to the Members of Congress as well as State highway agencies and city governments.</p>
<p>However, President Eisenhower was not aware of the urban highway segments.  His model for the Interstate System had been Germany’s autobahn: the rural highway network he had seen during and after World War II.  In the summer of 1959, rumor has it that he discovered the existence of urban highway segments when he passed construction of the Capital Beltway while being driven to the presidential retreat at Camp David.  An alternative theory is that he discovered the truth when he talked with urban planners about the District of Columbia’s freeway network.  Whichever way he found out, President Eisenhower asked his friend and adviser, retired General John Bragdon, to conduct a broad review of the Interstate program.  </p>
<p>On April 6, 1960, the President met with Bragdon, Secretary of Commerce Frederick Mueller, Federal Highway Administrator Bertram Tallamy, and others, to review Bragdon’s preliminary findings, including his view that the Interstates should include only roads that carry intercity traffic around and into cities.  Other urban Interstates should be eliminated.  Mueller and Tallamy objected.  The President responded that he now knew that the city officials and Members of Congress understood the urban highway segments were part of the program, even if they were contrary to his views.  By then, he had heard of, but not seen, the Yellow Book (Mueller handed him a copy) and had been told that it was one of the prime reasons Congress passed the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956</em>.  Although the concept was against his wishes, he felt his hands were tied.  The urban Interstates would remain part of the program.</p>
<p>The meeting ended, and so did the issue.   <br/>

<p>
<a name="question24"></a><strong>If I want to suggest another Interstate, how
            should I go about it?</strong> </p>
<p>
            Suggestions for building or designating another Interstate should
            be submitted to the State transportation department.  The
            Federal Highway Administrator may act only on requests submitted by
            a State transportation department (or departments in the case of
            multi-State routes).  The route must be built to Interstate
            standards, be a logical addition or connection, and coordinated
            with affected jurisdictions.  If the route is not yet
            complete, the State may request designation as a future part of the
            Interstate System. 
         </p>
<p>
            No special Interstate funding is available to build the route to
            Interstate standards, but the State may use regular Federal-aid
            highway funds, made available each year by statutory formula, for
            the route on a priority basis within funding limits.  From a
            motorist's standpoint, there is no difference between
            Interstate highways funded under the <em>1956 Act</em>, as amended, and
            Interstates funded in some other way.         </p>

<p><strong><a name="question25"></a>
            How can I get more lanes on my Interstate?         </strong></p>
<p>
            Because the Interstates are owned by the States and operated by the
            State transportation departments, anyone concerned about operation
            of an Interstate highway should contact State transportation
            officials.  They are in the best position to discuss proposals
            to upgrade Interstate highways.  They also can explain the
            project development process, which includes compliance with
            environmental requirements such as the <em>National Environment Policy
            Act</em>, public involvement, and identification of funding through the
            statewide transportation planning process (or metropolitan
            transportation planning process).         </p>

<p><strong><a name="question26"></a>
            How can we get an interchange built to improve access to the
            Interstate System?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The Interstate System has full access control.  This means
            only interchanges designed for safe, efficient operation provide
            access.  Although States own the Interstate highways, the
            Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has retained authority to
            approve any change in access, including new or modified
            interchanges. 
         </p>
<p>
            State transportation officials must initiate consideration of
            additional interchanges by submitting an Interchange Justification
            Report to the FHWA Division Office in the State.  The FHWA may
            approve the access point for the interchange if it complies with
            the policy on "Additional Interchanges to the Interstate
            System" published in the <i>Federal Register</i> on February
            11, 1998 (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191112143031/http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/access_mgmt/docs/policy_adtl_interchange.doc">
            http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/access_mgmt/docs/policy_adtl_interchange.doc</a>). 
            If the access point is approved, the State transportation
            department is responsible for following the normal project
            development stages (assessment of environmental impacts, detailed
            design, and, if needed, acquisition of right-of-way) before
            construction can begin.

<p><strong><a name="question28"></a>
            How can the States charge tolls on Interstates I paid taxes to
            build?         </strong></p>
<p>
            The Interstate System is free of tolls for the most part, but tolls
            are collected on some segments.  Most major toll roads were
            planned or built before the Congress authorized significant amounts
            of Federal funding for the Interstate highway program.  These
            segments were built by toll authorities created by State or local
            legislation to issue bonds as a way of financing construction.  Toll revenue is used to retire bonds and cover operating and
            maintenance expenses. 
         </p>
<p>
            One of the controversial issues Congress considered before passing
            this legislation was what to do with the turnpikes that had been
            built or planned in Interstate corridors without Federal
            funding.  In an extensive congressional debate, members
            considered purchasing the bonds to allow removal of the tolls, but
            this option would have cost hundreds of millions of dollars without
            creating any new Interstate mileage.  Another option was
            considered—constructing toll-free Interstate highways in these
            corridors—but it would have diverted funds needed for new
            highways in areas not served by Interstate-type facilities. 
            It also would have jeopardized the legitimate right of the toll
            authorities to pay their bondholders.  Therefore, Congress
            decided to include some toll facilities in the Interstate System to
            ensure connectivity.          </p>
<p>
            Federal law has changed over the years to allow turnpikes on the
            Interstate System under other circumstances.  In all, the
            46,876-mile Interstate System includes approximately 2,900 miles of
            turnpikes.

<p><strong><a name="question29"></a>
            How can I get a commemorative name for the Interstate in my
            town/county/State?         </strong></p>
<p>
            Although the Federal Government provided funds to help build the
            Interstate System, States own and operate the roads.  As a
            result, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) does not have the
            authority to name the routes.  The States may, if they wish,
            name any highway under their jurisdiction.  Each State has its
            own mechanism for doing so.  In some cases, the State
            legislature must take the initiative in passing a law to name the
            route.  In other cases, the State transportation department is
            responsible. 
         </p>
<p>
            Although the FHWA is not involved in the naming of highways, the
            FHWA is concerned about how the name is used or memorialized. 
            This concern is based on safety and operational
            considerations.  For example, if an Interstate highway is
            named after an important person, the FHWA would be opposed to
            placing a statue of the person on the roadside where it could have
            deadly consequences if struck by a vehicle.  Similarly, a sign
            providing information on the individual, military unit, or historic
            event should be placed in a location, such as a safety rest area,
            where it will not create safety or operational difficulties. 
            Once a highway is officially named, resolution of the sign
            placement and location issue is a matter to be cooperatively
            determined between the State transportation department and the
            FHWA.
         </p>
<p>
            Congress also can name Interstate highways by including the
            designation in the statutory language of a Federal law, such as the
            multi-year reauthorization bills for the Federal-aid highway
            program or the annual appropriations acts for the U.S. Department
            of Transportation. 
         </p>
<p>
            Anyone interesting in naming an Interstate highway should ask the
            State transportation department about the steps that would have to
            be followed in that State.

<a name="question30"></a><strong> Is it true that one out of five miles is straight so airplanes can land
            on the Interstates?</strong>
</p>
<p>
            No.  This is a myth that is so widespread that it is difficult
            to dispel.  Usually, the myth says the requirement came from
            President Dwight D. Eisenhower or the <em>Federal-Aid Highway Act of
            1956</em>.  However, no legislation, regulation, or policy has ever
            imposed such a requirement.  Airplanes do sometimes land on
            Interstates in an emergency, but the highways are not designed for
            that purpose.         </p>
<p align="right"><a href="#content">To Top</a></p>
<p><a name="question30a"></a><strong>Is it true that every so often there has to be a curve in a section of Interstate, to help keep drivers from falling asleep?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no.  Design standards don’t require curves to keep drivers from falling asleep, but that is one reason curves may be included.  </p>
<p>Although design standards don’t require curves at specific distances in the alignment of an Interstate highway, curves are introduced for a variety of reasons.  The reasons including taking advantage of the terrain along the route; avoiding obstacles or cultural development in the path; and, accommodating environmentally sensitive areas or mitigating impacts on them.  A curvilinear alignment also reduces the boredom of driving along extremely long tangent sections (engineer speak for “straight roads”), keeping the driver alert.  </p>
<p>Excessive curvature or poor combinations of curvature limit capacity, cause economic losses due to increased travel time and operating costs, and detract from a pleasing appearance.  Alignments should be as direct as practical; and consistent with the topography, developed properties, and community values.  A flowing line that conforms generally to the natural contours of the land is preferable to an alignment with long tangents slashing through the terrain.  Construction scars can be kept to a minimum and natural slopes and growth can be preserved.  </p>
<p>The alignment of a proposed highway should be determined by a detailed study of the area through which the road passes.  The finished highway, road, or street should be an economical, pleasant, and safe facility on which to travel. </p>

<p><strong><a name="question31"></a>Can I set up a business in safety rest areas or
            welcome centers selling food or other products to motorists?</strong> </p>
<p>
            No.  Section 111 of Title 23 ("Highways"), United
            States Code, prohibits the States from commercializing the
            right-of-way along the Interstate System.  The commercial
            prohibition in Section 111 dates to 1956 when Congress was
            considering the legislation that launched the Interstate Highway
            Program.  The Members considered following the model of the
            toll turnpikes that provided commercial facilities in service areas
            for motorists who would otherwise have to leave the facility and
            pay a toll to continue their journey.  Congress rejected this
            model by enacting the Section 111 prohibition on
            commercialization.  The intent was to avoid State approved or
            supported monopolies for traveler services, such as those provided
            on toll roads.  During the debate, Representative Charles A.
            Vanik (D-OH) explained what Congress had in mind:  "Let
            the highway traveler turn off the Interstate system if he requires
            food, motor-vehicle service, lodging or Stuckey's
            pecans."
         </p>
<p>
            The <em>Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982</em> modified the
            commercial restriction by permitting vending machines in rest and
            recreation areas constructed or located on the Interstate
            right-of-way.         </p>
<p>
            Safety rest areas are intended to serve motorists by allowing them
            to take a short break, use the rest rooms, shake off drowsiness,
            and then move on.  The absence of commercial services (except
            for vending machines) means motorists can stop without any pressure
            to make purchases.  For food, gasoline, lodging, and other
            commercial services, motorists can leave the highway and return to
            it without a toll charge. 
         </p>
<p>
            Section 1310 of the <em>Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient
            Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users</em>, approved August 10,
            2005, provides that the Secretary of Transportation shall establish
            an Interstate oasis program for designating facilities off the
            Interstate right-of-way that offer products and services to the
            public, 24-hour access to restrooms, and parking for automobiles
            and heavy trucks, and meet other standards to be determined. 
            Thus, as in the past, Congress has chosen an alternative for
            accommodating Interstate motorists that does not involve commercial
            services within the Interstate right-of-way (again, with vending
            machines as the exception).         </p>

<p><strong><a name="question32"></a> Why don't you pick up the litter? </strong></p>
<p>
            Litter along the highways has been a problem for years, long before
            the Interstate System came into existence.  States enact laws
            imposing fines for littering, but can enforce the law only if a
            police officer sees an act of littering.  Litter is part of
            each State's road maintenance responsibility, with funding
            for litter control coming from State sources. 
         </p>
<p>
            One approach to litter pick-up is the Adopt-A-Highway
            concept.  It began in Texas in 1985 as a way of meeting a
            public need by tapping the tremendous public spiritedness of
            citizens.  Each State and each community can adapt the concept
            to its own unique situation.  In general, when a group or
            individual agrees to clear litter periodically from a stretch of
            road, the State transportation department (or county or city)
            provides training to ensure litter is collected safely, along with
            trash bags, a sign displaying the name of the organization that
            adopted the highways, reflective vests, and other equipment.
         </p>
<p>
            Anyone concerned about roadside litter along the Interstates is
            encouraged to contact the State transportation department to
            discuss the Adopt-A-Highway program or other methods the State may
            use to collect litter.

<a name="question33"></a><strong>Didn't the<em> Lady Bird Johnson Act</em> ban
            billboards along the Interstate System?</strong> </p>
<p>
          The <strong>Highway Beautification Act of 1965</strong> (HBA),
            enacted with the help of Lady Bird Johnson and signed by her
            husband, President Lyndon B. Johnson, did not abolish billboards,
            or even abolish all billboards along certain highways, such as the
            Interstate System.  Rather, as amended over the years, it
            requires the Federal Highway Administration to ensure that the
            State transportation departments maintain "effective control
            of the erection and maintenance" of signs, displays, or
            devices, including outdoor advertising signs that are visible from
            the highway, beyond 660 feet of the Interstate right-of-way outside
            urban areas, and erected with the purpose of their message being
            read from the highway.  Signs not subject to meeting those
            criteria are limited to directional and official signs; signs
            advertising products for sale on the property on which they are
            located;  signs lawfully in existence before enactment of the HBA;
            and, those advertising the distribution by nonprofit organizations
            of free coffee to individuals traveling on the
            Interstates.          </p>

            The HBA also allows State and local officials to impose more
            stringent controls on billboards than those mandated by Federal
            law.  The result varies from State to State and even from
            community to community, with some States essentially banning
            billboards while others allow them to the maximum extent permitted
            under the HBA.

<strong>Can I pick the beautiful wildflowers along the
            Interstate? </strong>
</p>
<p>
            Many departments of transportation have begun planting wildflowers
            not only for their beauty but to save costs on mowing grass and
            trimming other plant growths.  Enjoy the increasing roadside
            wildflowers, but leave them for the pleasure of others.  It is
            especially dangerous to stop on a highway shoulder to pick or
            photograph these flowers.  It is also illegal in most
            States.  By the time you arrive at your destination, the
            wildflowers will likely have wilted anyway.  You will have
            lost their beauty, and we will have lost another seed source. 
         </p>
<p>  There is only one condition where you may dig up native
            wildflowers, grasses, ferns, etc., along the Interstate. 
   Every other condition is illegal and/or unsafe.  Highway
            construction projects are planned many years ahead.  If you
            know of a native plant remnant that should be salvaged and moved to
            a safe location before construction begins, contact your State
            transportation department to ask permission.</p>

<strong>Can my science class or community organization plant trees or            flowers on Interstate rights-of-way near our city? </strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, but you must contact your State transportation department to
            locate an appropriate spot and learn how to plant safely. 
            Many States require a plan and a permit for volunteer plantings in
            rest areas, city entry sites, or other locations.  Remember
            that trees are fixed objects and can be deadly if struck by a
            vehicle moving at high speed, so trees must be planted in areas
            where they will not cause safety problems.  Some States have
            special planting programs within Adopt-A-Highway or Adopt-A-Spot
         volunteer programs.  Call and learn more. </p>

<a name="question36"></a><strong>Why do we call Interstate  turnpikes “freeways” if they charge tolls?</strong>
<p>The term “freeway” refers to how motorists enter and leave the highway,  not how the highway was financed.  A  freeway has full control of access to provide for high levels of safety and efficiency  in the movement of large volumes of traffic at high speeds.  Freeways have grade separations at all  railroads and public crossroads, with interchanges at selected crossroads for  access.  Traffic can enter on via the  interchanges.</p>
<p>The toll turnpikes that have been incorporated into the Interstate  System are freeways.  They must have full  control of access to prevent motorists from using the facility without paying  the toll.</p>

<p><a name="question37"></a><strong>What is vertical clearance  and why did the Department of Defense (DOD) object to the minimum vertical  clearance for the Interstate System in the 1950s? </strong></p>
<p>“Vertical clearance” is the distance from the top of the pavement to  the bottom of structures crossing over the highway.  It is typically at least 1 foot higher than  the legal vehicle height, plus an allowance for future resurfacing that could  raise the top of the pavement.</p>
<p>Although the Federal-Aid Highway Act of  1956 added the words “and defense” to the name of the Interstate System (now  the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways),  the primary justification for the network was its civilian benefits, such as  economic opportunity, safety, relief of congestion, and evacuation of  cities.  At the height of the Cold War  and with an atomic or hydrogen bomb attack a conceivable possibility, Congress  added “and Defense” to the name in recognition of the fact that the Interstate  System would benefit the military, too.   However, the emphasis on civilian needs was consistent with the position  of the Department of War (now Defense, of course) dating to the early 1920s—if  we build a road network adequate for civilian needs, it will serve defense  needs as well, with some additions to connect with bases or military  plants.  It would not be possible to  justify such an expenditure solely on the basis of military needs.</p>
<p>In developing minimum design standards  for the Interstate System, the State highway agencies and the Bureau of Public  Roads (BPR) agreed in July 1956 to include a minimum vertical clearance of 14  feet in <em>Policy on Design Standards – Interstate System</em> prepared by the  American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and adopted by the BPR  for use on Interstate projects.  This  figure wasn't pulled out of thin air.   The DOD had previously indicated, in 1949 and 1955, that a 14-foot  vertical clearance was adequate for most military vehicles.  However, after the Soviet   Union launched its Sputnik satellite in October 1957, the DOD  determined that a 17-foot vertical clearance was needed for some larger equipment,  such as the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile, that could not be  transported by rail.  </p>
<p>This change led to a debate between the DOD  and the BPR that that was resolved by a compromise in 1960.  On January 27, 1960, the BPR issued instructions  to its field offices changing the minimum standard to 16 feet for Interstate  highways in rural areas.  In urban areas,  “application of the 16-foot clearance shall be limited to a single routing  where the revised vertical clearance can be developed most economically, even  though that single route is indirect.”   All projects under design or construction were to be revised according  to the new standard.  The first  construction project affected by the change was in Michigan,  where highway officials using hydraulic jacks lifted the Clear Lake Road overpass on I-94 near Lansing from a clearance  of 14-feet, 6-inches to 16-feet, 3-inches.</p>
<p>As for the routes built to the old  standard, DOD, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and AASHO agreed in 1969  on a 26,000-mile priority network that had 350 deficient structures and served  about 95 percent of the major military installations.  On the priority network, the States were  encouraged to implement, as rapidly as practical, those modifications necessary  to obtain a 16-foot clearance.  Off the  priority network, the 16-foot clearance would be implemented only in  conjunction with other construction work.   The FHWA explained that, “If the work necessary to obtain the clearance  is a logical addition and the cost is not excessive, it should be incorporated  into the overall project.”</p>
<p>The DOD remains concerned about vertical  clearance.  Today, the minimum vertical  clearance standards apply to all rural Interstates (not just a priority  network) and a single Interstate through each urban area.  All exceptions to this requirement, whether  for new construction or a reconstruction project that does not provide for the  16-foot minimum vertical clearance, would be coordinated with the DOD.  The FHWA stressed that this agreement applied  to the full roadway width, including shoulders for the through lanes, as well  as ramps and collector-distributor roadways in Interstate-to-Interstate  interchanges.  The vertical clearance  policy has been incorporated into <em>Policy on Design Standards – Interstate  System</em>.</p>

<p><a name="question38"></a><strong>When did President  Eisenhower sign the Highway Revenue Act of 1956? </strong></p>
<p>The Highway Revenue Act of 1956 was not a separate  piece of legislation.  </p>
<p>On February 6, 1956, Representative Hale Boggs (D-La.) of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced  H.R. 9075, the Highway Revenue Act of 1956. It contained a financing mechanism for the Interstate System based on  the concept that all revenue from highway user taxes would be set aside for  highway purposes.  At the suggestion of  Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey during testimony a few days later,  Representative Boggs modified the bill to provide the linkage by creating a  Highway Trust Fund modeled on the Social Security Trust Fund.  </p>
<p>The Boggs Bill  was submitted to the Committee on Public Works where Representative George H.  Fallon (D-Md.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Roads, combined it with his  authorizing bill, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. Although congressional action would modify  the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 in some ways, it would remain part of the bill  the House of Representatives and Senate approved on June 26, 1956.  As a result, the bill President Eisenhower  signed on June 29, 1956, and that became Public Law 84-627, included the  Highway Revenue Act of 1956 as Title II. Title I was called the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.</p>
<p>In short, the  President had to sign only one bill, not two, to create the program that gave  the country the Interstate System.</p>
