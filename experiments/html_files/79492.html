Her 92-year-old father, John Wesley Myers, was taken into custody that day and accused of attempted aggravated murder in the shooting of her and her brother, Mark Myers, 49, who was shot in the stomach. The shooting occurred about 7:30 a.m. at the home in the 4200 block of Southeast Cora Street. Officers found Mark Myers wounded outside the home, and Kim Mackintosh on a couch inside, and ordered the elder Myers to come out of the house with his hands up. Mackintosh's 12-year-old son, who is severely autistic, was found hiding inside the home but was unharmed. A Remington shotgun was in the basement. The boy was placed in a temporary foster care home for developmentally disabled children. Mackintosh was described as her son's and father's full-time caregiver. Myers told officers at the scene he was upset about his bank account being depleted, and believed his daughter was trying to commit him to get control of his house. A judge found Myers, who has dementia, unfit for trial, dismissed murder charges and let him move into a Southwest Portland adult care home. SOLVED. <br/> <br/>2.<b> Robert Joseph Campbell</b>, 64.

Stabbed to death April 14 on the front yard of a North Chase Avenue home. A Multnomah County grand jury indicted Ralph Anthony Williams, 54, in the stabbing. Kelly had obtained a temporary stalking order against Williams on March 18, citing harassment, intimidation, racial slurs and vandalism. He had a court date to seek a permanent stalking order. Both men lived in independent housing for the mentally ill in North Portland run by Cascadia Behavioral Healthcare. According to Williams, the day of the killing, Kelly had come into the common kitchen area, told Williams to get out of his way, and went back to his apartment. Williams told police he had "had enough" of Kelly, grabbed a butcher knife and waited for Kelly to return. Once he returned, Williams told police, he "let the knife do the talking." He said he stabbed Kelly five to seven times in the upper chest and head. As Kelly tried to run across the street, Williams tried to stab him in the back, a probable cause affidavit says. When the knife blade broke, Williams picked up a cinder block and struck Kelly in the face as he lay dying on neighbor's front yard. A trial is scheduled for May 2010. Williams told court authorities he suffered from PTSD, depression and had been prescribed medication, but quit taking them a year ago. Kelly died of stab wounds and blunt force trauma.

A 12-gauge pump shotgun was on a loveseat a few feet away. Perez had run out of the house screaming after the shooting. Neighbors heard him yelling, "He's dead! He's dead!" Perez told a neighbor he was holding a shotgun, and it "just slipped," and he had shot his roommate, according to a search warrant affidavit. Perez later told detectives he was on the loveseat, fiddling with the shotgun he had bought a few days earlier, loading and unloading the gun. A single blast struck Chance in the head. Since the shooting, Caron's parents, Lance and Helen Caron, have been supportive of Perez, who was a close friend of their son, and have pledged to help him through the ordeal. Lance Caron said he didn't know his son or Perez had guns or were interested in them. A Multnomah County grand jury, after hearing additional testimony, decided Perez acted with criminal negligence, not recklessness, and reindicted him on a lesser charge of negligent homicide.

He had worked in local tire shops for more than 30 years. Neighbors heard gunshots about 3 a.m. Bullets had penetrated the south side of the house and struck a vehicle parked alongside the house.

<p>16.<b> James Thedrick Lambert,</b> 52, died Sept. 21, eight days after he burglarized a home in the 1300 block of Northeast Sumner Street. He fell down the stairs during a confrontation with the two homeowners and then ran from police. He collapsed when police handcuffed him, and died more than a week later at Legacy Emanuel Hospital &amp; Medical Center from a combination of health conditions exacerbated by the burglary confrontation, according to Dr. Christopher Young, a deputy state medical examiner. Lambert had a heart condition that predisposed him to suffer arrhythmia. His heart stopped pumping blood, resulting in not enough oxygen to the brain. Young determined that the altercation during the home burglary caused him physiologic stress that put him into an arrhythmia. He ruled it a homicide, death at the hands of another person. Lambert was cooperative with police, and there was no struggle with officers. No charges were filed. SOLVED  <br/> <br/>

<p><br/><b>CLACKAMAS COUNTY  </b><br/> <br/>1. <b>Joseph Patrick Haley</b>, 28, was shot to death March 20 in a Milwaukie-area apartment complex.

The shooting immediately secured the safety of Kelly D. Finley, a 37-year-old single mother who was home with her two sons when Snell, a neighbor, pushed his way into her apartment on Southeast 21st Avenue and threatened to kill her unless she arranged for delivery of his medications. While Snell held his .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol on her, Finley frantically called pharmacies and clinics to obtain prescription drugs that Snell took for severe ulcerative colitis. During a lull in the threats, Finley stashed her two sons, ages 8 and 7, in her bathroom. And when Snell stepped outside, members of the Clackamas County special weapons and tactics team shot him. A grand jury found the shooting justified, declining to indict Sgt. Tim Beard and Deputy Justin Brummett. SOLVED.<br/> <br/>3.<b>Jesse Aaron Weatherford</b>, 22, of Milwaukie was shot and killed by police June 2 after provoking an armed confrontation at the complex where he lived with his mother. Police were called to the Northridge Condominiums, 12600 S.E. Freeman Way, to investigate a report of a bleeding man with a knife. When officers arrived, Weatherford ignored their orders to drop his knife and stop. When he continued to advance, they shot Weatherford with a less-than-lethal 40 mm sponge round, striking him on the foot. When he ignored further orders, police shot him twice in the chest. Medical examiners called noting that he had tried to kill himself twice in the hours before the confrontation and had called his mother to say goodbye. A Clackamas County grand jury declined to indict Sgt. Tom Broomfield and Officer Luke Strait in the shooting. <br/> <br/>4. <b>Jose Ramirez-Navarro</b>, 25, of Southeast Portland was found lying on the sidewalk outside a Clackamas-area apartment complex on July 13, with a severe stab wound to his abdomen. He was rushed to OHSU Hospital in Portland, but later died. A suspect in the stabbing, Ruben Anthony Arteaga, 20, is being held without bail in the Clackamas County Jail, charged with murder, manslaughter and second-degree assault. His trial in Clackamas County Circuit Court is set for Feb. 8, 2010.

The daughter was asleep on the first floor of the town home at the time of the assault. The victim was on the second floor and was pronounced dead at the scene. Beaverton police arrested 50-year-old Namegabe Kelekele Mushegero on suspicion he beat his wife to death.

SOLVED. <br/> <br/>2.<b> Juanita Rosales-Garcia</b>, 40, disappeared in early March after having an argument with her boyfriend, Delfino Hurtado-Navarette. An Oregon State Police trooper found her body April 3 in a wooded area near North Plains, after searching places where she had used her cell phone.

Police think Rosales-Garcia told Hurtado-Navarette she was going to leave him, after the couple had been together eight years, said Lt. Michael Rouches, Hillsboro Police Department spokesman. The autopsy found death was due to extensive bleeding and wounds to the throat from a sharp object. Hurtado-Navarette first reported Rosales-Garcia missing on March 10. Hillsboro police discovered Rosales-Garcia's Chevrolet Blazer April 1, abandoned in a local parking lot. Hurtado-Navarette is also sought by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for being in the country illegally, Rouches said. SOLVED. <br/> <br/>3. <b>Eluard Corzo Bernal</b>, 21, of Hillsboro, died in the hospital May23, several days after being injected with an overdose of heroin. Investigators originally thought the man had injected himself, but after a three-month investigation, arrested Kaleb Abraham, 21, on accusations of manslaughter. Investigators say Abraham, of Aloha, allegedly administered the heroin to get his friend high. Abraham was a regular user, Corzo Bernal an occasional user. When Corzo Bernal stopped breathing, Abraham used CPR on him and went back to bed, only to be awakened later by other roommates who reported Corzo Bernal was not breathing again. When CPR failed, Abraham drove him to the hospital so police wouldn't come to the house in Aloha and discover drug paraphernalia.

Police say he was a random victim who was not involved in gangs. Hernandez was walking with a 19-year-old man when three men pulled up in a car and began asking them what gang the two were affiliated with. One of the men from the car pulled a knife, and the two men tried to run. All three men from the car chased after Hernandez, pushed him to the ground and stabbed him in the chest and upper torso. Police later arrested three men: Duane E. Corbett, 22, and Maciel Munoz, 18, who were captured in Eugene, and Nicholas J. Sias, 23, who police at first thought was the victim of another stabbing the same night. His story, however, didn't add up, according to police, who were led to the other two men.

Two co-workers were wounded. The shooter, her estranged husband, Robert Beiser, 39, was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. They had two children, a 14-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son. The shooting was the first killing in this city of 26,000 since August 2001 and just its sixth since 1987. SOLVED. <br/> <br/>10. <b>Lori Fitzgerald,</b> 47, found dead Nov. 7 in her home in Forest Grove. Seventeen days later, police said she was the victim of an apparent homicide. Forest Grove arrested Josh David Nicholas, who they initially said was wanted on two outstanding warrants, in a Yamhill County home on Nov. 24. Forest Grove police say Nicholas had recently become acquainted with Fitzgerald and that they suspect he was in her home prior to police finding her body on Nov. 7. Nicholas has not been charged, but he has officially been identified as a person of interest in the murder. Capt. Jeffrey Williams said news of the slaying was not reported to the public because the initial call was of a suicide. However, he said, it became apparent early in the investigation that Fitzgerald's death was more likely a homicide. He said possessions, including guns, were missing from Fitzgerald's home. Nicholas was arraigned in Washington County on six charges including parole violation and possession of a stolen vehicle. Authorities stressed that the investigation into Fitzgerald's death in still ongoing. UNSOLVED.<br/>

Police say Steven England, 56, killed his wife and shot her adult son before shooting himself. The shooting occurred at a home in the 2500 block of 21st Avenue, said Capt. Aaron Ashbaugh, a Forest Grove police spokesman. It was about three blocks from Pacific University, a private school in the city west of Hillsboro. Officers responded about 6:30 p.m. and found Cindy England shot dead and  Coleman, lying injured atop her body in the house, he said. Coleman, who suffered gunshot wounds to his back and shoulder, called 9-1-1 to alert authorities, Ashbaugh said. Coleman was airlifted to OHSU Hospital in Portland, where he died about 11 p.m. The residence had broken glass and other signs of forced entry. Officers searching the scene found Steven England, 56, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in a large shed in the backyard. They recovered a gun. Officers had arrested England on a domestic violence accusation in January 2008, and he was convicted the next month. A neighbor said he was the subject of a restraining order. SOLVED. <br/> <br/>17. <b>Sheena Mendoza,</b> 20, was shot and killed by her estranged boyfriend on Nov. 29 at the Great Clips hair salon in Hillsboro. Curt Wayne Wise, 40, shot Mendoza in a break room of the business, where she was assistant manager. Wise then turned the gun on himself, firing one round into his head. He spent two days in critical condition at Legacy Emanuel Hospital and died Dec. 1 after Wise's brother, Charles Wise of Texas, told police and hospital officials not to keep his brother on life support. "He committed a grave crime and there's no use in him suffering only to be put in prison for the rest of his life," Charles Wise said. Curt Wise was found with a note in his pocket saying he did not want to be resuscitated and to donate his organs. Charles Wise said he hoped his brother's organs could help someone else so "his life might have some meaning." Charles Wise said he had not spoken to his younger brother, his only sibling, for about a year and a half and had not seen him since 1995. He didn't know his brother was dating Mendoza, or what would have driven him to kill her. "I'm flabbergasted that he would do something like that," he said. "There's no way of getting my mind around it." Charles Wise said he and his brother, who had previously owned a computer service business, were never very close. "We were so different. I'm a realist and his head was always in the sky," he said. "He's always into emulating certain things and I'd say you don't emulate anyone else's life, you have your own." Curt Wise divorced his wife in December 2007 and his "quality of life had decreased," his brother said. Wise and Mendoza had been dating for about a year, Rouches said, but about two weeks ago she left and moved back in with her mother. Her father, Dennis Martinez, a Forest Grove firefighter, died in October. Charles Wise said he did not expect a funeral to be held for his brother. "He erased everything good in his life by this one act," Charles Wise said. SOLVED.
