<h2>Reports and Data</h2>
<h3>Available Reports</h3>
<p>One of the benefits to California schools participating in CalSCHLS is that a district/school can compare local results with those from other districts/schools and to county and state norms. Such comparisons can help in interpreting trends and guiding program decisions by placing the results in a larger context of what is happening elsewhere. By participating you also contribute to a statewide dataset that can be analyzed to provide insight into broad factors affecting student success that benefit all schools.</p>
<p>Standard <strong>district student and staff reports</strong> are produced in less than three weeks for 90% of districts when the survey is administered online. When the survey is administered in paper-and-pencil format, reports are produced in less than seven weeks after print answer forms are received at WestEd. Reports based on custom survey configurations can take longer. District reports are <strong>publicly</strong> posted to this <a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/reports-data/search-lea-reports/">website</a> by the end of November of the year following administration. Parent survey results are not posted on the website.</p>
<p id="slcr"><strong>School-level CalSCHLS reports</strong> and user-friendly <strong>School Climate Report Cards (SCRCs)</strong> may be requested by a district (or an individual school) if its survey includes a sufficient number of students. These reports are not publicly posted. District-level (aggregated) SCRCs also are available, as well as a <a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/site/assets/files/1036/sci_methodology071712b.pdf">description</a> of how the SCRC school climate index is created. Requests for these reports can be made by contacting your Regional Technical Advisor (888-841-7536 or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191208195505/mailto:calschls@wested.org">CalSCHLS@wested.org</a>).</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Countywide CHKS reports</strong> are generated when funding is available. These are two-year aggregated and weighted reports that encompass all schools that administered the CHKS within the two-year cycle within a county.</p>
<h3>State-level reports</h3>
<h4 id="biennial_statewide_student_reports">Biennial Statewide Student Reports</h4>
<p>Statewide norms in California are provided by the Biennial Statewide CHKS Report, funded by Department of Health Care Services and based on a randomly-selected representative sample of secondary schools surveyed over a two-year period. The Biennial CHKS instrument consists of the CHKS Core Module and the supplemental module on Alcohol and Other Drugs.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="aggregated_calschls_reports">Aggregated CalSCHLS Reports</h4>
<p>Aggregated state-level reports are created by combining all the data from all districts that administered the CHKS over a two-year period, because most districts administer the survey every other year. Aggregated state-level reports are provided for the Elementary CHKS and the California Staff School Survey. The Biennial State CHKS Report (described above) is used to provide results for secondary students, as the results are derived from a sample designed to be representative of the state.</p>

<h3>Search LEA Reports</h3>
<p><a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/reports-data/search-lea-reports/">Access the search engine</a> to obtain student and staff reports at the district- and county-level for every administration of the CHKS and CSSS since Fall 2007.</p>
<h3>Data Dashboards</h3>

<li><a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/reports-data/public-dashboards/">CalSCHLS Public Data Dashboards</a>. Examine and graphically display the most recent state and district CHKS results, trends over time, and disparities in survey outcomes across subgroups. Elementary school results can be displayed for 21 indicators for all 5th grade students, males and females, and by participation in afterschool programs. Secondary school results can be displayed for 23 indicators from the <a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/survey-administration/downloads/#ssm_core">Core Survey Module</a> and 12 indicators from the <a href="/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/survey-administration/downloads/#ssm_sc">School Climate Module</a> across 11 subgroups.</li>
<li><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191208195505/https://calschls.org/my-surveys/">CalSCHLS District Private Data Dashboard</a>. Districts may purchase a two-year subscription to a password protected, private district dashboard that displays up to seven years of CalSCHLS data at the district level and the individual school level. The District Private Data Dashboard provides designated staff with graphical data displays for the district as a whole, for all schools in the district on the same page to enable comparisons across schools, and for a single, individual school. Results are benchmarked to district and state averages and can be used to examine data trends overtime overall and by subgroup. The District Private Data Dashboard can be ordered anytime by contacting your Regional Technical Advisor (888-841-7536 or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191208195505/mailto:calschls@wested.org">CalSCHLS@wested.org</a>).</li>
