<h1>License of the Press</h1>
Mark Twain<br/>
Hartford, Conn. Monday Evening Club<br/>
March 31, 1873<br/>
(annotated by Paul Schindler)<br/>
Based on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190608000539/http://www.archive.org/stream/completeworksofm24twai/completeworksofm24twai_djvu.txt">Full
text of "The complete works of Mark Twain [pseud.] Mark Twains Speeches
Vol. 24"</a>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><o:p>[some
text missing]<br/>
 </o:p>(the
press) has scoffed at religion
till it has made scoffing popular. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">It
has defended official criminals,
on party pretexts, until it has created a United States Senate whose
members
are incapable of determining what crime against law and the dignity of
their
own body is, they are so morally blind, and it has made light of
dishonesty
till we have as a result a Congress which contracts to work for a
certain sum
and then deliberately steals additional wages out of the public pocket
and is
pained and surprised that anybody should worry about a little thing
like that.<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;"><a name="ret_fn1"></a>I am
putting all this odious state
of things upon the newspaper, and I believe it belongs there — chiefly,
at any
rate. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">It
is
a free press — a press that
is more than free — a press which is licensed to say any infamous thing
it
chooses about a private or a public man, or advocate any outrageous
doctrine it
pleases. It is tied in no way. The public opinion which should hold it
in
bounds it has itself degraded to its own level. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">There
are laws to protect the
freedom of the press's speech, but none that are worth anything to
protect the
people from the press. A libel suit simply brings the plaintiff before
a vast
newspaper court to be tried before the law tries him, and reviled and
ridiculed
without mercy. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">The
touchy Charles Reade<a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a><a name="ret_fn_2"></a>
can sue
English newspapers and get verdicts; he would soon change his tactics
here: the
papers (backed by a public well taught by themselves) would soon teach
him that
it is better to suffer any amount of misrepresentation than go into our
courts
with a libel suit and make himself the laughing stock of the community.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">It
seems to me that just in the
ratio that our newspapers increase, our morals decay. The more
newspapers the
worse morals. Where we have one newspaper that does good, I think we
have fifty
that do harm. We ought to look upon the establishment of a newspaper of
the
average pattern in a virtuous village as a calamity. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">The
difference between the tone and
conduct of newspapers to-day and those of thirty or forty years ago is
very
noteworthy and very sad — I mean the average newspaper (for they had
bad ones
then, too). </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">In
those days the average newspaper
was the champion of right and morals, and it dealt conscientiously in
the
truth. It is not the case now. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">The
other day a reputable New York
daily had an editorial defending the salary steal and justifying it on
the
ground that Congressmen were not paid enough — as if that were an
all-sufficient excuse for stealing.<a href="#fn3" name="ret_fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> That
editorial put the matter in a
new and
perfectly satisfactory light with many a leather-headed reader, without
a
doubt. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">It
has become a sarcastic
proverb<span style="">  </span>that a
thing must be true if you
saw it in a newspaper. That is the opinion intelligent people have of
that
lying vehicle in a nutshell. But the trouble is that the stupid people
— who
constitute the grand overwhelming majority of this and all other
nations — do
believe and are moulded and convinced by what they get out of a
newspaper, and
there is where the harm lies. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Among
us, the newspaper is a
tremendous power. It can make or mar any man's reputation. It has
perfect
freedom to call the best man in the land a fraud and a thief, and he is
destroyed
beyond help. Whether Mr. Colfax is a liar or not can never be
ascertained now —
but he will rank as one till the day of his death — for the newspapers
have so
doomed him.<a href="#fn4" name="ret_fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Our
newspapers — all of them,
without exception — glorify the "Black Crook" and make it an opulent
success — they could have killed it dead with one broadside of
contemptuous
silence if they had wanted to.<a href="#fn5" name="ret_fn5"><sup>5</sup></a>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Days
Doings and Police Gazettes<a href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a><a name="ret_fn6"></a>
flourish in the land unmolested by the law, because the virtuous
newspapers
long ago nurtured up a public laxity that loves indecency and never
cares
whether laws are administered or not. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">In
the newspapers of the West you
can use the editorial voice in the editorial columns to defend any
wretched and
injurious dogma you please by paying a dollar a line for it. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Nearly
all newspapers foster
Rozensweigs and kindred criminals and send victims to them by opening
their
columns to their advertisements. You all know that.<a href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup><a name="ret_fn7"></a></sup> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">In
the Foster murder case the New
York papers made a weak pretense of upholding the hands of the Governor
and
urging the people to sustain him in standing firmly by the law; but
they
printed a whole page of sickly, maudlin appeals to his clemency as a
paid
advertisement.<a href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a><sup><a name="ret_fn8"></a></sup> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">And
I
suppose they would have
published enough pages of abuse of the Governor to destroy his
efficiency as a
public official to the end of his term if anybody had come forward and
paid
them for it — as an advertisement. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">The
newspaper that obstructs the
law on a trivial pretext, for money's sake, is a dangerous enemy to the
public
weal. That awful power, the public opinion of a nation, is created in
America
by a horde of ignorant, self-complacent simpletons who failed at
ditching and
shoemaking and fetched up in journalism on their way to the poorhouse. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">I
am
personally acquainted with
hundreds of journalists, and the opinion of the majority of them would
not be
worth tuppence in private, but when they speak in print it is the
newspaper
that is talking (the pygmy scribe is not visible) and then their
utterances
shake the community like the thunders of prophecy. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">I
know from personal experience the
proneness of journalists to lie. I once started a peculiar and
picturesque
fashion of lying myself on the Pacific coast, and it is not dead there
to this
day. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Whenever
I hear of a shower of
blood and frogs combined, in California, or a sea serpent found in some
desert,
there, or a cave frescoed with diamonds and emeralds (always found by
an Injun
who died before he could finish telling where it was), I say to myself
I am the
father of this child — I have got to answer for this lie. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">And
habit is everything — to this
day I am liable to lie if I don't watch all the time. The license of
the press
has scorched every individual of us in our time, I make no doubt. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Poor
Stanley was a very god, in
England, his praises in every man's mouth. But nobody said anything
about his
lectures — they were charitably quiet on that head, and were content to
praise
his higher virtues. But our papers tore the poor creature limb from
limb and
scattered the fragments from Maine to California — merely because he
couldn't
lecture well. His prodigious achievement in Africa goes for naught —
the man is
pulled down and utterly destroyed — but still the persecution follows
him as
relentlessly from city to city and from village to village as if he had
committed some bloody and detestable crime. <a href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a><sup><a name="ret_fn9"></a></sup> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">Bret
Harte was suddenly snatched
out of obscurity by our papers and throned in the clouds — all the
editors in
the land stood out in the inclement weather and adored him through
their
telescopes and swung their hats till they wore them out and then
borrowed more;
and the first time his family fell sick, and in his trouble and
harassment he
ground out a rather flat article in place of another heathen Chinee,
that
hurrahing host said, "Why, this man's a fraud," and then they began
to reach up there for him. And they got him, too, and fetched him down,
and
walked over him, and rolled him in the mud, and tarred and feathered
him, and
then set him up for a target and have been heaving dirt<span style=""> 
</span>at him ever since.<a href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a><sup><a name="ret_fn10"></a></sup> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">The
result is that the man has had
only just nineteen engagements to lecture this year, and the audience
have been
so scattering, too, that he has never discharged a sentence yet that
hit two
people at the same time. The man is ruined — never can get up again.
And yet he
is a person who has great capabilities, and might have accomplished
great
things for our literature and for himself if he had had a happier
chance. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">And
he made the mistake, too, of
doing a pecuniary kindness for a starving beggar of our guild — one of
the
journalistic shoemaker class — and that beggar made it his business as
soon as
he got back to San Francisco to publish four columns of exposures of
crimes
committed by his benefactor, the least of which ought to make any
decent man
blush. The press that admitted that stuff to its columns had too much
license.<a href="#fn11"><sup>11<a name="ret_fn11"></a></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">In
a
town in Michigan I declined to
dine with an editor who was drunk, and he said, in his paper, that my
lecture
was profane, indecent, and calculated to encourage intemperance. And
yet that
man never heard it. It might have reformed him if he had.<a href="#fn12"><sup>12<a name="ret_fn12"></a></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">A
Detroit paper once said that I
was in the constant habit of beating my wife and that I still kept this
recreation up, although I had crippled her for life and she was no
longer able
to keep out of my way when I came home in my usual frantic frame of
mind. Now
scarcely the half of that was true. Perhaps I ought to have sued that
man for
libel — but I knew better.<a href="#fn13"><sup>13<a name="ret_fn13"></a></sup></a> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">All
the papers in America — with a
few creditable exceptions — would have found out then, to their
satisfaction,
that I was a wife beater, Si and they would have given it a pretty
general
airing, too. Why I have published vicious libels upon people myself —
and ought
to have been hanged before my time for it, too — if I do say it myself,
that
shouldn't. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt;">But
I
will not continue these
remarks. I have a sort of vague general idea that there is too much
liberty of
the press in this country, and that through the absence of all
wholesome
restraint the newspaper has become in a large degree a national curse,
and will
probably damn the Republic yet. There are some excellent virtues in
newspapers,
some powers that wield vast influences for good; and I could have told
all
about these things, and glorified them exhaustively — but that would
have left
you gentlemen nothing to say.<br/>

<a name="fn1"></a>1) The <i>New York
Times</i> describes the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190608000539/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0607.html">salary
grab</a> in some detail. Briefly, according to Wikipedia: "On
March 3, 1873, President Grant signed a law that
authorized the President's salary to be increased from $25,000 a year
to
$50,000 a year and Congressmen's salaries to be increased by $2,500.
Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for previous two
years of
service. This was done in secret and attached to a general
appropriations bill.
Reforming newspapers quickly exposed the law and was repealed on
January 1874.
Grant missed an opportunity to veto the bill and to make a strong
statement for
good government"<br/>

it, was involved in many lawsuits.<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">According to <i style=""><span style="">Bookseller: the organ of the book trade, </span></i>By
the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland, Publishers'
Association, March 1, 1873</p>

Versus the <i style="">Morning Advertiser</i></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reade won 200 pounds from the
Morning Advertiser in a libel
suit. In 1872, the paper’s critic, Mr. Lee, wrote that Shilly Shally, a
play
Reade had based on Anthony Trollope’s Ralph the Heir, was “an
indelicate play,
or, at all events, a play containing very indelicate passages.” He also
called
it “thin in story” and “weak.” For good measure, Mr. Lee added that
“decent
people… have not the moral courage to hiss down the wretched double
entendres
which disgust them.” <br/>

piece of musical theatre that conforms to the modern notion
of a "book musical". The book is by Charles M.
Barras (1826-1873), an American playwright. The music is mostly
adaptations,
but some new songs were composed for the play, notably "March of the
Amazons" by Giuseppe Operti, and "You Naughty, Naughty Men",
with music by George Bickwell and lyrics by Theodore Kennick.<span style=""> </span>It opened on September 12,

According to Wikipedia: "The National Police Gazette, commonly referred
to as simply the Police Gazette, was an American magazine founded in
1845 by two journalists, Enoch E. Camp, also an attorney, and George
Wilkes, a transcontinental railroad booster.[1] The editor and
proprietor from 1877 until his death in 1922 was Richard Kyle Fox, an
immigrant from Ireland.<br/>
Ostensibly devoted to matters of interest to the police, it is a
tabloid-like publication, with lurid coverage of murders, Wild West
outlaws, and sport. It is well known for its engravings and photographs
of scantily clad strippers, burlesque dancers, and prostitutes, often
skirting on the edge of what is legally considered obscenity."<br/>

<p>"[March 21, 1873] William Foster — who spent two years
warding off execution
— finally succumbed to New York’s hangman.</p>
<p>Foster’s case was a long-term headline-grabber: he
drunkenly accosted a
couple of perfect strangers on the Broadway Line (think horses, not
trains),
then smashed the man of the party, Avery Putnam, with a conductor’s
device
going by the sinister name of “car-hook”. His case turned, both
juridically and
in the public eye, on the question of whether Foster had formed an
“intent”
sufficient to justify a first-degree murder conviction; the killer’s
own jury
later joined appeals for his reprieve, having felt buffaloed by public
opinion
in the immediate aftermath of the crime."<br/>

<p>Excerpted from the BBC website: Henry Morton Stanley <em><span style="font-style: normal;">was a Welsh-born American

Africa. He </span></em>was born John Rowlands on 28
