SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Tom <span data-page="page_1"></span>Sullivan was sitting in a third-floor committee
roomÂ inÂ the Colorado capitol last Wednesday when hisÂ phone lit up with news alerts describing a mass shooting
in a Florida high school. In the five years since his
son was murdered, with eleven other people, in an Aurora movie theatre,
Sullivan has returned to the capitolâs wood-panelled hearing rooms and marble hallways more than twenty times. He has grown used to
lawmakers rarely looking him the eye. He has learned to state his name
for the record and to keep his testimony, recounting the worst day of
his life, to roughly two minutes.</p><p>In 2013, Sullivan was among a small group of parents who lost children
in Aurora or Newtown or Columbine who helped Democrats push Coloradoâs
legislature to enact tougher gun-control measures despite intense opposition from the N.R.A. After
receiving the Parkland news alerts last week, Sullivan testified against
the latest effort to roll back those measures, a proposal
in the stateâs Republican-controlled Senate that would expand
concealed-carry rights in Colorado. The measure passed the committee in
a party-line vote but this week was <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/21/gun-control-debate-colorado-2018/" target="_blank">defeated</a>, along with two other measures to
loosen restrictions on guns, in the stateâs Democrat-controlled House. For now Coloradoâs stricter measures, including universal
background checks and a ban on magazines of more than fifteen rounds,
remain law.</p><p>Sullivan, who ran, unsuccessfully, for state Senate in 2016, says that
Colorado shows that strengthening gun-control laws is possible, but
keeping them in place requires political vigilance. âIt is disappointing
we have to play defense all the time,â he told me.</p><p>In the broader national narrative of N.R.A. invincibility, Colorado is an exception. Leveraging a statewide network of activists built
over the preceding decade and funded by Michael Bloomberg and other
national gun-control advocates, Democrats passed the gun-control
measures when they controlled Coloradoâs governorship and the state
legislature. But they did not anticipate the backlash
that allowed Republicans to win control of the state Senate by ousting
two Democratic state senators in recall votes and winning a third seat
after a Democrat resigned.</p><p>The governor, John Hickenlooper, a brewpub owner turned
politician, said in an interview this week that after the Aurora
shooting he thought he could foster a bipartisan consensus regarding
universal background checks. He recalled having cordial conversations
about gun laws with Second Amendment experts and Republican donors
heading into the 2013 legislative session. âEvery single Republican I
talked to supported universal background checks,â Hickenlooper said. âSo, in my naÃ¯vetÃ©, I thought it would whiz right
through.â</p><div class="Callout__inset-right___3Etg2" data-callout="inset-right" data-type="callout"><div class="CuratedEmbed__container___1VdYz"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/parkland-school-shooting" target="_blank"><h3 class="CuratedEmbed__hed___WpzZ8">Further Reading</h3><p class="CuratedEmbed__dek___4PRlj">New Yorker writers respond to the Parkland school shooting.</p></a></div></div><p>As the bills moved through the legislative process, hundreds of gun
owners clogged the halls of the capitol. Representative Rhonda Fields, the
Democratic lawmaker who sponsored the two main bills in the House,
received death threats, as did two pro-gun-control lobbyists. Magpul,
which manufactures high-capacity magazines, threatened to shutter its
northern Colorado factory if the magazine limit became law. (The company
followed through, relocating and moving roughly a hundred jobs to
Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 2015.) Several of Coloradoâs sheriffs, mostly from
rural counties, later sued the state in an effort to overturn the new
laws. The lawsuits failed, but the N.R.A. and local gun-rights groups persist in their yearly efforts to reverse
the laws.</p><p>Will Coyne, one of two lobbyists hired by Bloombergâs organization
Mayors Against Illegal Guns, described 2013 as a year-long political
epiphany. âI realized I did not fully understand politics in America,
and how intrinsically the segment of society that cares about gun
rights, how deeply they believe that, how much gun rights are wrapped up
in their political and cultural identity,â he said.</p><p>John Morse, a former Colorado Springs-area police chief who passed the
measures when he served as the president of the Colorado state Senate,
paid the heaviest political price. Although Morse expresses no regrets, he saidÂ his recall after the gun-safety measures passed
created an excuse for other Democrats not to act. âWe beat the N.R.A. in
Colorado, and then what happened was they beat us,â he said. âThey rode
me out of town on a rail, and now thereâs not a Democrat in the country
that has the stomach to do what needs to be done.â</p><p>Coyne praised Morse, saying âhe pushed as far as he possibly could, and
he did it because he thought it was the right thing to do, and he did it
without fear of consequence. In my career, Iâve never seen another
politician act like that.â</p><p>Democrats also initially underestimated the intensity of support for some gun-control initiatives on their own side. The
magazine ban gathered steam when Hickenlooper, known for his political
caution, unexpectedly got behind it. âIt was tangible in a way
background checks werenât,â Coyne, the lobbyist, told me. âPeople could
hold the magazines and see the difference in size. It actually
galvanized our side in a way we hadnât expected, and it gave us more
momentum.â</p><p>Gun-rights advocates, meanwhile, seized on the legislative battle to boost their own membership rolls and organize
protests (including a day when gun owners circled the capitol
in cars while honking their horns). Hickenlooper contends that as mass
shootings continue to occur, broader public frustration will grow. With
significant federal reforms unlikely, he predicted that more states will
eventually enact reforms similar to Coloradoâs.  âI think those folks, the people that really thought that this was too great a cost to
payânow history<span data-page="page_final"></span> says, if anything, we should have pushed a little further,â Hickenlooper said. âWhile Iâm sure there are things in the process we could have
changed or improved, I donât have any anxiety or self-doubt that what we did was important and right.â</p><p>A <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us02202018_trends_ugbw51.pdf/" target="_blank">Quinnipiac Univerity poll</a> released this week found that sixty-six per cent of American voters supported stricter gun control laws, a fourteen per cent increase since 2015. Coyne said
that his private polling from last December showed support for
Coloradoâs gun laws trending up, with
thirty-one per cent supporting the laws in 2014 and thirty-eight per cent
supporting them in 2017.</p><p>Tom Sullivan returned to the capitol this week to testify against a measure designed to roll back the stateâs
high-capacity magazine ban. He cautioned the young activists of Parkland
that âanger is only going to take you so far in this,â but lauded their
resolve. âI applaud those Florida students for what theyâre
doing,â he said. âI welcome them into the fight, because thatâs what
this is going to be.â</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div

and Igor Fruman](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giulianis-two-indicted-associates-could-have-a-lot-to-say) were arrested at Dulles International Airport, Parnas was visiting Manhattan. It was during the U.N. General Assembly, and a large Ukrainian delegation was in town. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine and grew up in Brooklyn, lives in Florida and runs an energy business with a Wall Street address. He was staying at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, just off of Columbus Circle, which has been his favorite hotel âfrom the first day it opened,â he told me. Parnas, a longtime fan of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)âs real-estate businesses, was an early supporter of Trumpâs 2016 campaign for President. Now, after working on behalf of Trumpâs lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), to investigate Joe Biden and [his son Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), in Ukraine, Parnas and Fruman are at the center of the investigation that could result in the Presidentâs impeachment.\n\nTwo days after the Speaker of the House, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), announced that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, potentially charging him with seeking to enlist the help of the Ukrainian government to damage Bidenâs campaign, Parnas sat down with me at a table for two at Bouchon Bakery, near his hotel, and reminisced about his work as Giulianiâs fixer in Ukraine and elsewhere, where he collected dirt on the Bidens and the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie Yovanovitch. At our meeting, Parnas was accompanied by a bodyguard, who watched from a distance. âYou canât be too careful,â he said. He ordered a coffee and handed me a thick business card for Global Energy Producers, on which he is listed as the companyâs C.E.O. and co-founder. (The Web site for the company now reads, âLooks Like Youâre Lost.â) \n\nParnas had sat in on many of Giulianiâs phone calls and meetings involving Ukraine, he said, including one in May between Giuliani and an envoy of Volodymyr Zelensky, the new Ukrainian President, which took place in Madrid. Giuliani told me that, at this meeting, he received assurances that Zelenksyâs administration would pursue several investigations sought by Trump, including one into the Bidens. Parnas was clearly proud of his work for Giuliani and seemed unfazed by his proximity to the impeachment inquiry. âIâm a businessman who obviously is close to the mayor, is close to the President,â he said. âI love the President. I love the Administration. I fully support him and honestly think he is going to go down as probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Presidents ever. What heâs doing is outstanding.â \n\nParnas was born in February, 1972, in the port city of Odessa, in southwestern Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. He was three when his family moved to the United States. âI came here as a legal immigrant, through a legal process,â he said. His family settled in Detroit, where they lived for about a year, before relocating to Brooklyn. When Parnas was sixteen, he worked at Kings Highway Realty, selling Trump Organization co-ops. âThat was my first time knowing who Trump was, but, growing up in that area, you knew who Trump was, because his name was all over the place,â he said. \n\nIn 1995, when Parnas was twenty-three, he moved from Brooklyn to Florida. On visits to New York, he stayed at Trump properties. Parnas said that, until Trump announced his run for the Presidency, on June 16, 2015, he didnât consider himself a Republican or a Democrat. âI was really never heavy into politics, never really contributed,â he said. Then, in June, 2015, Parnasâs teen-age son, Aaron, called his father. âDad, I think one of your friends is running for President,â he joked. Aaron told me that, after Trump announced his candidacy, he called the Trump campaign to get passes to go with his father to a Trump rally in Florida. \n\nParnas soon became a regular at Trumpâs rallies and other gatherings. âI started donating. We started to help raise money,â he said. Gradually, Parnas said that he got to know other Trump donors, including Tommy Hicks, Jr., a private-equity investor in Texas who is close to Donald Trump, Jr. (Hicks has since become the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.)âWe became one big family,â Parnas said. âYou got to understand, he didnât have a real campaign, a traditional campaign. It was make-it-up, you know. Like him or not, you understand what it is. It was more, like, you know, weâd bump into each other constantly because it was all the same people, there were not that many of us.â Parnas told me that he âbumped intoâ Trump âplenty of timesâ at events in New York over the years, but that they didnât get to know each other until the 2016 campaign. (Trump recently distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman, saying, âI donât know those gentlemen. Now, itâs possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.â)\n\nOn Election Night, Parnas, along with other donors, including the Blackwater founder Erik Prince, were invited to attend a gathering with Trump and his family. âWe were all there,â he recalled. âI will never forget that.â His go-to hotel in Manhattan, Trump International Hotel & Tower, was fully booked, so he stayed at the Intercontinental, where Hillary Clintonâs running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, and his family were watching the results come in. âWe came home laughing and celebrating at three or four in the morning,â Parnas said. âThe whole Democratic Party was at the hotel. It was quiet, pitch black.â\n\nParnas said that he grew closer to Giuliani after the election. âWe were good friends, heâs also my counsel,â he said. âWe were looking to do business together.â When Giuliani wanted to gather information in Ukraine to counter the findings of the special counsel Robert Muellerâs Russia investigation, Parnas volunteered to help. âBecause of my Ukrainian background and my contacts there, I became like Rudyâs assistant, his investigator,â he said. âI donât do anything on my own. I donât lobby people. I go get information. I set up a meeting. I make sure that the call went right. I make sure the translation is done right.â Parnas echoed the claims of Trump and Giuliani that the Democrats had worked with Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Paul Manafort, Trumpâs former campaign manager, ahead of the 2016 vote, seeming to imply that what he and Giuliani were doing now was little different. \n\nIn late 2018, Parnas said, he helped to connect Giuliani with the former Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was fired in 2016, by President Petro Poroshenko, after Biden and other U.S. and European officials complained that Shokin was lax in pursuing corruption. Biden, in particular, had threatened to withhold a billion dollars in loans that the Ukrainian government desperately needed. In a Skype call with Giuliani, Shokin falsely claimed that he was fired because he wanted to investigate Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, Joe Bidenâs son, was on the board. Ukrainian and American officials said that Shokin, contrary to what he told Giuliani, did not actively investigate Burisma while he was prosecutor-general, and that the dormant cases in Ukraine that targeted Burismaâquestioning how it obtained its exploration licenses and whether it paid all of its taxesâhad nothing to do with Hunterâs role on the board. But Parnas said that he accepted Shokinâs claim that Biden had him fired to protect Hunter. In Parnasâs view, âShokin basically stepped down, and allowed himself to get fired, to save the country.â\n\nParnas said that Giuliani wanted Shokin to travel to New York for a follow-up conversation. At Giulianiâs direction, Parnas spoke to Shokin about setting up his visit. âI said, âListen, itâs going to be unofficial,â&nbsp;â he recalled. Shokin, who has a daughter living in California, told Parnas that he would seek a visa to visit her and would then meet Giuliani. Parnas said that Shokin was denied a visa. (Shokin did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAccording to Parnas, Giuliani helped him and Fruman get high-level meetings in Kiev, including by writing a letter of introduction to a minister in Zelenskyâs government. Parnas and Fruman used the meetings to collect information that they hoped would be of interest to Trump, and to pitch energy deals for themselves. âWe became a hot commodity. Past, presentâeverybody came with a story to tell,â Parnas recalled. âItâs like a movie, youâre hearing all these stories. Youâre, like, are you kidding me?â Ukrainian officials told me that they were surprised by the indiscretion of Parnas and Fruman. A senior Ukrainian official said, of the two men, âThey were looking to sell gas to Ukraine. They were looking for partners. Then, in the course of discussions, they were very open, I would say surprisingly open, about their plans to discredit Biden and to replace the Ambassador.â\n\nParnas told me that some of the Ukrainian officials and businessmen whom he met were distrustful of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who started her posting in Kiev during President Obamaâs second term. Parnas said he heard that she had been âbadmouthingâ Trump, saying that he would soon be impeached and that Ukrainian officials shouldnât listen to him. Parnas said that he shared this information with the former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions and with Giuliani, who lobbied the State Department and Trump to remove the Ambassador. âI had a meeting with Pete Sessions that had nothing to do with that. It was about our gas company,â Parnas said. âIn the meeting, Pete asked me, âDo you know anything about Yovanovitch?â I told him what I heard. Unbeknownst to me, Pete was already looking into it, and when I left he opted to write a letter to [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo that day.â (After Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Sessions said in a statement that he would âvigorously defend myself against any allegations of wrongdoing.â) \n\nThe Trump Administration abruptly recalled Yovanovitch in May. Last week, in remarks to the three committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch rebutted the rumors spread by Parnas and Fruman, saying that she served in her role âon a strictly nonpartisan basis.â She added, âOur efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen.â\n\nParnas, like many of the Presidentâs most dedicated supporters, rejects the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. âItâs total bullshit,â he said. He described the Mueller investigation and the impeachment inquiry as âa modernized coup,â adding, âBefore, you would use armies, guns. Now they use newspapers, television, the Internet, and media to be able to manipulate the crowd to such a point where whatever they say becomes the truth.â He ended our nearly ninety-minute meeting on a wistful note, saying that he looked forward to returning home to Florida and spending more time with his wife and son. âHeâs the real story,â Parnas said, of Aaron. âMy son graduated college at sixteen. Heâs graduating law school at twenty. Heâs about to be a lawyer. Heâs doing some fascinating things. He wants to be President one day.â\n\nThe [federal indictment of Parnas and Fruman](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giulianis-two-indicted-associates-could-have-a-lot-to-say) alleges that the two and other defendants engaged in âa scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidatesâ governments.â Since Parnas was arrested at Dulles with a one-way ticket to Vienna, it has emerged that he had been working as a translator with American lawyers representing Dmytro Firtash, one of Ukraineâs wealthiest businessmen, who has been battling extradition to the U.S. to face trial for bribery charges. Firtash has lived in Vienna for five years, but Parnasâs lawyer, John Dowd, told me that Parnas was not boarding a flight to Vienna to see Firtash when he was arrested. Dowd said that Parnas bought a one-way ticket because a round-trip fare, at the last moment, would have cost him nearly twenty thousand dollars.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rudy

Some candidatesâ memoirs tell stories of humble beginnings and of obstacles overcome; some describe searches for identity; some earnestly set out detailed policy agendas. Nearly all are relentlessly bland. In 2017, [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), a longtime senator from Delaware, [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama)âs Vice-President for eight years, and now a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, published an unusually raw memoir about the death, two years earlier, of his forty-six-year-old son, Beau, describing how it had threatened to undo him but ultimately brought his family closer. Beau, his father writes, was âJoe Biden 2.0,â a war veteran, a prosecutor, and a promising politician who âhad all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.â\n\nIn the early months of the 2020 race, Joe Biden holds a lead over his many Democratic Party rivals, but he is hardly invulnerable. He is seventy-six and sometimes shows it. He often stumbles when defending his five-decade public history. Some voters will not easily overlook his support for the Iraq War, his treatment of Anita Hill and loose management of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, his handsy, close-talking behavior with women, or his descriptions of his âcivilâ working relationships with segregationist lawmakers. Even his admirers concede that he is prone to senatorial bloviation. What often seems to redeem him with voters, as a former senior White House aide put it recently, is âhow heâs responded to tragedy and what heâs learned from it.â\n\nYet the family story that Biden tells in âPromise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purposeâ largely glosses over a central character in Bidenâs life. Biden writes, âI was pretty sure Beau could run for President some day, and, with his brotherâs help, he could win.â Hunter Biden, who is forty-nine, is described as a supportive son and sibling. In speeches, Biden rarely talks about Hunter. But news outlets on the right and mainstream media organizations, including the _Times_, have homed in on him, reprising old controversies over Hunterâs work for a bank, for a lobbying firm, and for a hedge fund, and scrutinizing his business dealings in China and Ukraine.\n\nThere is little question that Hunterâs proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former aide told me, âHunter is super rich terrain.â But [DonaldÂ J. Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Bidenâs candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice-President to advance and protect his sonâs interests.\n\nAt the same time, the gossip pages have seized on Hunterâs tumultuous private life. He has struggled for decades with alcohol addiction and drug abuse; he went through an acrimonious divorce from his first wife, Kathleen Buhle Biden; and he had a subsequent relationship with Beauâs widow, Hallie. He was recently sued for child support by an Arkansas woman, Lunden Alexis Roberts, who claims that he is the father of her child. (Hunter has denied having sexual relations with Roberts.)\n\nOn May 17th, the day before Hunter planned to appear at one of his fatherâs rallies, at Eakins Oval, in Philadelphia, [Breitbart News](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-is-steve-bannon-without-breitbart) published a story based on a Prescott, Arizona, police report from 2016 that named Hunter as the suspect in a possible narcotics offense.\n\nOnstage at the rally, Jill Biden introduced her husband. âThe Biden family is ready,â she said. âWe will do this as we always haveâas a family.â Seated in white chairs to the side of the stage were Ashley Biden, Hunterâs half sister; Ashleyâs husband, Howard Krein; Beauâs children, Natalie and Robert Hunter; Hunterâs three daughters, Maisy, Finnegan, and Naomi; and Naomiâs boyfriend, Peter. The last seat in the row, with a piece of paper on it that said âReserved,â remained empty.\n\nIn one of my early conversations with Hunter, he told me about his sadness at having missed his fatherâs event. âBeau and I have been there since we were carried in baskets during his first campaign,â he said. âWe went everywhere with him. At every single major event and every small event that had to do with his political career, I was there. Iâve never missed a rally for my dad. The notion that Iâm not standing next to him in Philadelphia, next to the Rocky statue, itâs heartbreaking for me. Itâs killing me and itâs killing him. Dad says, âBe here.â Mom says, âBe here.â But at what cost?â\n\nHunter speaks in the warm, circuitous style of his father. Through weeks of conversations, he became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on âHannity.â He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. âLook, everybody faces pain,â he said. âEverybody has trauma. Thereâs addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnelâitâs a never-ending tunnel. You donât get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter Biden was born in 1970, a year and a day after Beau and a year and nine months before their sister, Naomi. His father was twenty-seven, and won his first election, to the New Castle County Council, in November of that year. Two years later, in an immense leap of ambition, he decided to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden pledged that, in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, he would never own a stock or a bond. Whatever money he had, he spent on property. His father, Joseph Biden, Sr., managed a Chevrolet dealership in Wilmington, and Joe grew up in a house with his parents, his three siblings, his aunt Gertie, and two uncles. He tried to re-create this arrangement for his own family. He liked historic houses, and bought a center-hall Colonial, built in 1723, on a four-acre lot in the village of North Star, about thirty minutes west of Wilmington. âThe large houses were a way for all of us, including aunts and uncles, to have something special,â Hunter said.\n\nJoe Biden depended on his family to help staff his campaigns. His sister, Valerie, who taught at the Quaker day school Wilmington Friends, served as his campaign manager. His brother Jimmy oversaw fund-raising; Frankie, the youngest, helped organize volunteers. When the children were babies, Bidenâs wife, Neilia, carried them to community meetings. In November, 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate.\n\nThat December, while Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office, Neilia took the children to Wilmington, to go Christmas-tree shopping. At an intersection, the family car collided with a truck. Neilia and Naomi were killed almost instantly. Beau sustained numerous broken bones, and Hunter suffered a severe head injury. Hunter has frequently said that his first memory is of waking up in a hospital bed next to Beau, who turned to him and said, âI love you, I love you, I love you.â On January 5, 1973, Biden was sworn in as a senator in his sonsâ hospital room.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a0a795e00084262e1]||||||\n+++\n\nValerie and Jimmy devoted themselves to the boysâ recovery while Biden took up his role in the Senate. In 1975, he sold the North Star property, and the family moved into a house in Wilmington that had once been owned by members of the du Pont family. Biden, on returning from Washington, often put on a hazmat suit and went into the basement to scrape asbestos off the pipes. He, Hunter, and Beau planted trees and painted the house. Hunter told me that his father would dangle him upside down from the third-floor windows so that he could reach the eaves with a brush. So many people came and went that Tommy Lewis, an old friend of Bidenâs who became one of his Senate aides, nicknamed the house the Station. Hunter recalled, âNo door was ever locked. The pool was everyoneâs pool.â He and Beau were âcommunal property,â he said. âEveryone had a hand in raising us.â In 1977, Joe Biden married Jill Jacobs, a high-school teacher. (Hunter calls Jill âMomâ and refers to Neilia as âMommy.â)\n\nBiden frequently took the boys to Washington with him when Congress was in session. Roger Harrison, who worked in Bidenâs office for seven years, recalled that one of them often sat on Bidenâs lap during staff meetings. If he was busy on the Senate floor, another senator would take Hunter and Beau to his office to hang out. Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the boys would wander over to the Senate gym and sit in a corner of the steam room, eavesdropping on lawmakers.\n\nBeau and Hunter were fiercely close. They attended Archmere Academy, the Catholic high school that was their fatherâs alma mater. Friends called Beau, a stickler for rules, the Sheriff. Hunter told me, âIf we wanted to jump off a cliff into a watering hole, I would say, âIâm ready, letâs go,â and Beau would say, âWait, wait, wait, before we do it, make sure there arenât any rocks down there.âÂ â Brian McGlinchey, a friend of Hunterâs who attended Archmere with the brothers, said, âBeau tended to lead with his head. Hunter often led with his heart.â At Archmere, Beau, with the help of Hunter, who distributed flyers, was elected student-body president. It was clear to family and friends that Beau would follow his father into politics. âDad knew that is what Beau wanted,â Hunter said.\n\nBiden sold off some of the land at the Station to help pay for Beau to go to the University of Pennsylvania, in 1987\\. That year, Hunter and Beau encouraged their father to run for President, and they were crushed when he withdrew from the race over allegations of plagiarism. (He was accused of copying large portions of a law-review article as a student, and of mimicking a speech given by the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.) Soon afterward, when Biden took his sons to a football game at the University of Pennsylvania, a group of hecklers started a chant about the plagiarism scandal. Hunter jumped to his feet, throwing punches, and his father and Beau had to pull him back.\n\nHunter enrolled at Georgetown University in 1988\\. He and Beau took out student loans to cover their university costs. Hunter worked odd jobsâparking cars at events and unloading sixty-pound boxes of frozen beefâto help pay for his room and board. Ted Dziak, a chaplain-in-residence in Hunterâs freshman dorm, told me, âHunter was always out there, doing something to gain a little bit of money.â\n\nIn July, 1992, after graduating with a B.A. in history, Hunter began a year as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon. During that time, he met Kathleen Buhle, the daughter of a Chicago schoolteacher and a ticket salesman for the White Sox. Three months after they started dating, Kathleen got pregnant, and the two were married in July, 1993.\n\nBeau attended Syracuse Law School, and began thinking about government service. Hunter imagined a more artistic career for himself. He admired Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff; his favorite novel at the time was Charles Bukowskiâs dÃ©but, âPost Office.â On a whim, he applied to, and was accepted into, the creative-writing program at Syracuse University, where Carver and Wolff had taught. He considered getting a joint M.F.A.-law degree at Syracuse, but, with a baby on the way, he decided to go straight to law school. He was rejected from Yale, his first choice, and enrolled at Georgetown Law. In December, 1993, his daughter Naomi was born.\n\nAfter a year at Georgetown, Hunter transferred to Yale Law, where he completed his degree, in 1996\\. Then he returned to Wilmington with Kathleen and Naomi. Joe Biden was running for reÃ«lection in the Senate, and he appointed Hunter as his deputy campaign manager. Hunter rented an apartment close to his fatherâs campaign headquarters, and also got a job as a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company based in Delaware, which was one of the largest donors to his fatherâs campaigns. At the age of twenty-six, Hunter, who was earning more than a hundred thousand dollars and had received a signing bonus, was making nearly as much money as his father. In January, 1998, the conservative reporter and columnist Byron York wrote, in _The American Spectator_, âCertainly lots of children of influential parents end up in very good jobs. But the Biden case is troubling. After all, this is a senator who for years has sermonized against what he says is the corrupting influence of money in politics.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter shared his fatherâs love of old houses. In 1997, he bought a dilapidated estate in Wilmington, the original structure of which dated to before the Revolutionary War. The previous owner, Anna Sasso, recalled, âThey seemed like the perfect family. They were teen-agers, practically. They were so enthusiastic.â That year, Beau started working as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorneyâs office in Philadelphia, and moved in with his brotherâs family, taking over the third floor. Hunter was responsible for the mortgage and most of the expenses. In September, 1998, Hunter and Kathleen had their second daughter, Finnegan. On weekends, the house was a gathering place for friends, including a local woman named Hallie Olivere, whose parents owned a dry-cleaning business. Beau and Hallie married in 2002.\n\nHunter, by then an executive vice-president at MBNA, found the corporate culture stifling. âIf you forgot to wear your MBNA lapel pin, someone would stop you in the halls,â he recalled. In 1998, he contacted William Oldaker, a Washington lawyer who had worked on his fatherâs Presidential campaign in 1987, for advice about how to get a job in the Clinton Administration. Oldaker called William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, who had also worked on Bidenâs campaign. Daley, the son of the five-term mayor of Chicago, told me that, because of their shared experience growing up in political families, he empathized with Hunter, and asked his staff to evaluate him for a position as a policy director specializing in the burgeoning Internet economy. Hunter got the job, then sold the Delaware house for roughly twice what heâd paid for it and moved his family to a rental home in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. Hunter and Kathleen sent Naomi and Finneganâand later Maisy, who was born in 2000âto Sidwell Friends, one of Washingtonâs most exclusive and expensive schools. Hunterâs salary barely covered the rent, the school fees, and his familyâs living expenses. âIâve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck,â Hunter told me. âI never considered it struggling, but it has always been a high-wire act.â\n\nIn late 2000, near the end of President Clintonâs second term, Hunter again consulted Oldaker, who was starting a lobbying business, the National Group. Oldaker asked the co-founder of the firm, Vincent Versage, to teach Hunter the basics of earmarkingâthe practice of persuading lawmakers to insert language into legislation which directs taxpayer funds to projects that benefit the lobbyistâs clients. In 2001, Robert Skomorucha, an old Biden family friend who worked in the government-and-community-relations department at St. Josephâs University, proposed that Hunter solicit earmarks for one of the universityâs student-volunteer programs, at an underprivileged high school in Philadelphia. Timothy Lannon, the universityâs president, who offered Hunter the contract, described Hunter to me as âlike his dad: great personally, very engaging, very curious about things and hardworking,â adding that he had âa very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.â\n\nVersage told me that the National Group had a strict rule: âHunter didnât do anything that involved his dad, didnât do anything that involved any help from his dad.â Oldaker advised Hunter to restrict his clients to mostly Jesuit universities. âHe wasnât doing McDonnell Douglas or something,â Oldaker told me. Still, Hunterâs name appeared regularly in newspaper stories decrying the cozy relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. An informal arrangement was established: Biden wouldnât ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldnât tell his father about them. âIt wasnât like we all sat down and agreed on it,â Hunter told me. âIt came naturally.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOldakerâs office was across the street from the Bombay Club, an Indian restaurant that was popular with policymakers, lobbyists, diplomats, and journalists. The lounge there became an after-hours gathering place for Hunter, Versage, and a dozen of their colleagues. Irfan Ozarslan, the former general manager, said that he greeted Hunter at the door âat least three or four times a week.â The bartender at the time, Norman, told me that he would have a cigarette waiting for Hunter at his seat.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d4]||||||\n+++\n\nJoe Biden grew up around relatives with alcohol problems, and at a young age he decided to abstain. Hunterâwho spoke frankly to me about his struggles with addictionâstarted drinking socially as a teen-ager. When he was a student at Georgetown, in the early nineties, he took up smoking Marlboro Red cigarettes, and occasionally used cocaine. Once, hoping to buy cocaine, he was sold a piece of crack, but he wasnât sure how to take the drug. âI didnât have a stem,â Hunter said. âI didnât have a pipe.â Improvising, he stuffed the crack into a cigarette and smoked it. âIt didnât have much of an effect,â he said.\n\nIn 2001, Hunter, Kathleen, and their children moved back to Wilmington to be closer to the rest of the Biden family, and Hunter commuted to Washington on Amtrak, as his father did. Sometimes he missed the last train and stayed in a rental room at the Army and Navy Club. âWhen I found myself making the decision to have another drink or get on a train, I knew I had a problem,â he said. In 2003, Kathleen and the girls returned to Washington. Hunter recalled that Kathleen told him to get sober, starting by not drinking for thirty days. âAnd I wouldnât drink for thirty days, but, on day thirty-one, Iâd be right back to it,â he said. That September, on a business trip, he looked up rehabilitation centers, and soon admitted himself to Crossroads Centre Antigua for a month. The day after his return, Beau accompanied him to his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, in Dupont Circle.\n\nBy the mid-two-thousands, a growing number of lawmakers were criticizing earmarking as a waste of taxpayer money and a boon to special interests. Hunter was concerned about his future as a lobbyist, and his financial worries increased in 2006, when he bought a $1.6-million house in an affluent neighborhood. Without the savings for a down payment, he took out a mortgage for a hundred and ten per cent of the purchase price.\n\nIn 2006, Hunter and his uncle Jimmy Biden, along with another partner, entered into a twenty-one-million-dollar deal to buy Paradigm, a hedge-fund group that claimed to manage $1.5 billion in assets. Hunter said that the deal sounded âsuper attractive,â but that it fell apart after he and Jimmy learned that the company was worth less than they thought, and that the lawyer they were working with was a convicted felon awaiting sentencing. Hunter and Jimmy, who together went on to buy a stake in the company, estimated that they lost at least $1.3 million on the initial venture, which Hunter described as âa tragicomedy.â To help repay a law firm that had put up the money to initiate the transaction, Hunter obtained a million-dollar note against his house from Washington First Bank, which was co-founded by Oldaker. On January 5, 2007, two days before Biden announced his decision to run for President, Hunter and Jimmy were sued by their former partner in New York. The suit was settled but resulted in a flurry of headlines.\n\nIn the lead-up to the January, 2008, Iowa Democratic Presidential caucuses, Hunter drove from Washington to Des Moines to campaign with his father. âIâm like his security blanket,â Hunter said. âI donât tell the staff what to do. Iâm not there giving directions or orders. I shake everybodyâs hands. And then I tell him to close his eyes on the bus. I can say things to him that nobody else can.â Biden did poorly in Iowa, and soon dropped out of the race. On August 23, 2008, Obama, the Democratic nominee, publicly introduced Biden as his running mate. He praised Beau, who had recently become Delawareâs attorney general and was getting ready to deploy to Iraq with his National Guard unit.\n\nHunter had heard that, during the primaries, some of Obamaâs advisers had criticized him to reporters for his earmarking work. Hunter said that he wasnât told by members of the Obama campaign to end his lobbying activities, but that he knew âthe writing was on the wall.â Hunter told his lobbying clients that he would no longer represent them, and resigned from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak, a role for which, Hunter said, the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid had tapped him. âI wanted my father to have a clean slate,â Hunter told me. âI didnât want to limit him in any way.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn September, 2008, Hunter launched a boutique consulting firm, Seneca Global Advisors, named for the largest of the Finger Lakes, in New York State, where his mother had grown up. In pitch meetings with prospective clients, Hunter said that he could help small and mid-sized companies expand into markets in the U.S. and other countries. In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator [John Kerry](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-kerry)âs stepson and an heir to the food-company fortune, and Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model who started his finance career at Citibank in Asia and who had been friends with Heinz at Yale. (Heinz and Archer already had a private-equity fund called Rosemont Capital.) Heinz believed that Hunter would share his aversion to entering into business deals that could attract public scrutiny, but over time Hunter and Archer seized opportunities that did not include Heinz, who was less inclined to take risks.\n\nIn 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capitalâand, potentially, capital from other countriesâin companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHRâs board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House.\n\nIn December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President [Xi Jinping](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/xi-jinping). Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegationâs hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didnât understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. âHow do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?â he said.\n\nHunterâs meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Bidenâs advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his fatherâs visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunterâs behavior invited questions about whether he âwas leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasnât done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.â When I asked members of Bidenâs staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. âEveryone who works for him has been screamed at,â a former adviser told me. Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, âgot deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. Itâs like youâve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.â\n\nFor another venture, Archer travelled to Kiev to pitch investors on a real-estate fund he managed, Rosemont Realty. There, he met Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, one of Ukraineâs largest natural-gas producers. Zlochevsky had served as ecology minister under the pro-Russian government of [Viktor Yanukovych](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-trump-russia-investigation-and-the-mafia-state). After public protests in 2013 and early 2014, the Ukrainian parliament had voted to remove Yanukovych and called for his arrest. Under the new Ukrainian government, authorities in Kiev, with the encouragement of the Obama Administration, launched an investigation into whether Zlochevsky had used his cabinet position to grant exploration licenses that benefitted Burisma. (The status of the inquiry is unclear, but no proof of criminal activity has been publicly disclosed. Zlochevsky could not be reached for comment, and Burisma did not respond to queries.) In a related investigation, which was ultimately closed owing to a lack of evidence, British authorities temporarily froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky.\n\nIn early 2014, Zlochevsky sought to assemble a high-profile international board to oversee Burisma, telling prospective members that he wanted the company to adopt Western standards of transparency. Among the board members he recruited was a former President of Poland, Aleksander KwaÅniewski, who had a reputation as a dedicated reformer. In early 2014, at Zlochevskyâs suggestion, KwaÅniewski met with Archer in Warsaw and encouraged him to join Burismaâs board, arguing that the company was critical to Ukraineâs independence from Russia. Archer agreed.\n\nWhen Archer told Hunter that the board needed advice on how to improve the companyâs corporate governance, Hunter recommended the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was âof counsel.â The firm brought in the investigative agency Nardello & Co. to assess Burismaâs history of corruption. Hunter joined Archer on the Burisma board in April, 2014\\. Three months later, in a draft report to Boies Schiller, Nardello said that it was âunable to identify any information to date regarding any current government investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma,â but cited unnamed sources saying that Zlochevsky could be âvulnerable to investigation for financial crimesâ and for âperceived abuse of power.â\n\nVice-President Biden was playing a central role in overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine, and took the lead in calling on Kiev to fight rampant corruption. On May 13, 2014, after Hunterâs role on the Burisma board was reported in the news, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a âprivate citizen.â Hunter told Burismaâs management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father. KwaÅniewski told me, âWe never discussed how the Vice-President can help us. Frankly speaking, we didnât need such help.â\n\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunterâs role at Burisma had no effect on his fatherâs policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that âHunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his fatherâs message.â The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted âto be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.â A former business associate said, âThe _appearance_ of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.â\n\nIn December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunterâs relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administrationâs special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: âDad said, âI hope you know what you are doing,â and I said, âI do.âÂ â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter was not always at ease as the son of the Vice-President. He asked that the Secret Service stop deploying agents to accompany him, a request that was eventually granted. He also became offended when he felt that his father wasnât treated respectfully enough by Obama and his advisers. In 2012, Biden, responding to a question about same-sex marriage on NBCâs âMeet the Press,â said that he was âabsolutely comfortableâ with all couples having the âexact same rights.â Obama had yet to publicly take a similar stance, and Bidenâs statement upset some White House officials. Hunter thought that Obama and his advisers should have acknowledged his fatherâs good political instincts.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a4a87a600089f0d46]||||||\n+++\n\nHunter said that he limited his social interactions with Bidenâs White House colleagues, because he didnât want to be in a situation âwhere Iâm playing golf with the President or one of his aides and look at my phone and see another headline that reads â*President Makes Joke About Biden*{: .small}.âÂ â Kathleen felt differently about the White House. Their daughter Maisy was in the same class at Sidwell Friends as Sasha, the Obamasâ younger daughter. The two girls became close, and Kathleen and Michelle Obama became friends, attending SoulCycle and Solidcore exercise classes together almost every day. Some evenings, they went out to dinner or had drinks at the White House. Kathleen went on vacations with Michelle, mutual friends, and their daughters.\n\nHunter saw himself as a provider for the Biden family; he even helped to pay off Beauâs law-school debts. But he often wished that, like his father and his brother, he could contribute more to society. Through his business, he got to know an Australian-American former military-intelligence officer named Greg Keeley, who regaled him with stories about his career in the Royal Australian Navy. After moving to the United States, at forty, Keeley had obtained an age waiver to join the U.S. Navy as a reservist. While on reserve duty at a U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan on September 11, 2011, he and members of his unit watched Vice-President Biden deliver a speech at the Pentagon about the attacks of 9/11\\. After the speech, Keeley sent an e-mail to Hunter to tell him that members of his unit thought the Vice-Presidentâs message was âspot on.â Hunter passed the note on to his father, who wrote Keeley an e-mail. âKeep your heads down,â it said. âYou are the finest group of warriors in all of history.â\n\nKeeley helped convince Hunter that it wasnât too late for him to join the Navy Reserves. He told me, âMy message to him was: If you feel the call to serve, which I encouraged, it doesnât really matter what your rank is and whatâs on your shoulder boardâit is that youâre serving your country. Hunter took that message to heart and acted upon it.â With a letter of recommendation from Keeley, Hunter applied for an age waiver, which the Navy granted. The service has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol-abuse policy, and states that all recruits will be asked âquestions about prior drug and alcohol use.â Hunter disclosed that he had âused drugs in the past,â but said that he was now sober, and the Navy granted him a second waiver.\n\nHunter had suffered his first relapse, after seven years of sobriety, in November, 2010, when he drank three Bloody Marys on a flight home from a business trip to Madrid. He continued to drink in secret for several months, then confided in Beau and returned to Crossroads Centre. He had another relapse in early 2013, after he suffered from a bout of shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers. When the prescription ran out, he resumed drinking.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence, but was given a job in a public-affairs unit. In a small, private ceremony at the White House, Hunter was sworn in by his father. Later that month, the night before Hunterâs first weekend of Reserve duty, he stopped at a bar a few blocks from the White House. Outside, Hunter said, he bummed a cigarette from two men who told him that they were from South Africa. He felt âamped upâ as he was driving down to Norfolk, and then âincredibly exhausted.â He told me that he called Beau and said, âI donât know whatâs going on.â Beau drove from Delaware to meet Hunter at a hotel near the naval station. âHe got me shipshape and drove me into the base,â he said. On his first day, Hunter had a urine sample taken for testing.\n\nA few months later, Hunter received a letter saying that his urinalysis had detected cocaine in his system. Under Navy rules, a positive drug test typically triggers a discharge. Hunter wrote a letter to the Navy Reserve, saying that he didnât know how the drug had got into his system and suggesting that the cigarettes heâd smoked outside the bar might have been laced with cocaine. Hunter called Beau, who contacted Tom Gallagher, a former Navy lawyer who had worked with Beau at the U.S. Attorneyâs office in Philadelphia. Gallagher agreed to represent Hunter pro bono, but it became clear that, given Hunterâs history with drugs, an appeals panel was unlikely to believe the story that he had ingested cocaine involuntarily, and that appealing the decision would require closed-door hearings and the testimony of witnesses, increasing the likelihood of leaks to the press. Hunter decided not to appeal. Navy records show that Hunterâs discharge took effect on February 18, 2014.\n\nHunter did not tell anyone except his father and his brother about the reason for his discharge, and he tried to get his drinking under control. In July, 2014, he went to a clinic in Tijuana that provided a treatment using ibogaine, a psychoactive alkaloid derived from the roots of a West African shrub, which is illegal in America. Hunter then drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where he met with Thom Knoles, a practitioner of Vedic meditation, who said that he advised Hunter to meditate twice a day, to help keep âhis cravings for alcohol at bay.â Knoles said that Hunter struck him as âjust a good man.â He was ânearly clean,â Knoles said. âBut, to be honest, there is such a thing as a dry drunk. I could see that he was in a very delicate position.â Knoles said that Hunter told him about how much he relied on Beau for support and confessed that âhis relationship with his other great, deep partner in life, his wife, had been brutalized by him through his loss of control.â\n\nThat fall, Hunter went to Big Sur, California, to attend a twelve-step yoga retreat at the Esalen Institute. Toward the end of his week there, a reporter from the _Wall Street Journal_ contacted the Vice-Presidentâs office, seeking comment on Hunterâs discharge from the Navy. At San Francisco International Airport, Hunter was waiting for his flight home when he saw the story on the front page of the _Journal_. âI was heartbroken,â he said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Hunter, Beau, and their families took a vacation together on Lake Michigan. During the trip, Beau became disoriented and was rushed to the hospital. Heâd had a health scare in May, 2010, whenâsix months after he returned from Iraqâhe suffered a stroke. He had appeared to recover quickly, and continued to work as Delawareâs attorney general, but he struggled to remember certain words, and sometimes talked about hearing music playing when there was none.\n\nSoon after Beauâs admittance to the hospital, doctors identified a mass in his brain. It was glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain tumor. Patients who receive similar diagnoses tend to live no longer than two years. As Beau received radiation treatment, his motor and speech skills started to decline. In the spring of 2015, he underwent an experimental procedure in which an engineered virus was injected directly into the tumor, but it was unsuccessful. In late May, doctors removed Beauâs tracheostomy tube, telling the family that he would likely die within a few hours. Beau kept breathing on his own for almost a day and a half before he died, surrounded by his family.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, thousands of people paid their respects at a service at St. Anthony of Padua Church, in Wilmington. The next day, President Obama, Ashley Biden, and Hunter, who was fearful of public speaking, delivered eulogies. On the drive back to Washington, Hunterâmoved by the outpouring of support for him and his family at the funeralâtold Kathleen that he was thinking about running for public office. She pointed out that he had only recently been discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine. They rode the rest of the way home in silence. (Kathleen declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIn couples therapy, Hunter and Kathleen had reached an agreement: if Hunter started drinking again, he would have to move out of the house. A day after their twenty-second anniversary, Hunter left a therapy session, drank a bottle of vodka, and moved out. Later that month, Zlochevsky, the Burisma co-founder, invited him to Norway on a fishing trip. Hunter brought along Maisy and Beauâs nine-year-old son, Robert. Hunter said that, every night, he and his colleagues on the trip drank a single shot of liquor before going to bed. Kathleen found out and was angry. Hunter began to confide in Hallie, whom he was growing closer to.\n\nHunter said that, in July, 2015, âI tried to show Kathleen: I want back in.â He enrolled as an outpatient in the Charles OâBrien Center for Addiction Treatment, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was prescribed two drugs, one to lessen his cravings and another to make him feel nauseated if he drank. He then enrolled in an inpatient program for executives at Caron Treatment Centers, where he used the pseudonym Hunter Smith. On returning to Washington, he began a program that required him to carry a Breathalyzer with a built-in camera.\n\nThat summer, Ashley Madison, a dating service for married peopleâwhich used the slogan âLife is short. Have an affairââdisclosed that hackers had breached its user data. In late August, Breitbart reported that it had found a âRobert Bidenâ profile among the leaked files. Hunter denied that the account belonged to him, but Kathleen was deeply embarrassed by the story. Two months later, Hunter and Kathleen agreed to formally separate. On October 21, 2015, Joe Biden appeared in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Jill and Obama, and announced that he would not run for President in 2016, talking about the time that it had taken the family to recover from Beauâs death.\n\nUntil mid-December, Hunter practiced yoga daily. A teacher from his yoga studio told me, âI donât think Iâve ever seen a person try as hard to heal as he did.â When Hunter stopped coming to class, the teacher went to his apartment, near Logan Circle, and knocked on the door. Hunter told me that he pretended not to be at home. For weeks, he said, he left the apartment only to buy bottles of Smirnoff vodka at Logan Circle Liquor. Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was O.K. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment. Hunter said that his father told him, âI need you. What do we have to do?â\n\nIn February, 2016, Hunter went back to the Esalen Institute, and then spent a week skiing by himself at Lake Tahoe. When he returned to Washington, he enrolled in yet another addiction-treatment program, run by the Kolmac Outpatient Recovery Center. On his way to Kolmac, he passed several homeless people, including a middle-aged woman who went by the name Bicycles, because of the bike she took with her everywhere. Later, whenever Hunter saw Bicycles near his apartment, he would give her a twenty-dollar bill to buy him a pack of Marlboro Reds and tell her to keep the change. One rainy night, Hunter said, he offered Bicycles his spare bedroom, and she stayed for several months.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 2016, Hunter was consulting for five or six major clients. Once or twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that took place in Europe. He said that, in June, 2016, while in Monte Carlo for a meeting, he went to a hotel night club and used cocaine that a stranger offered him in the bathroom. He told his counsellors at Kolmac about his relapse but refused to take a drug test, out of concern that the results could be used against him and published in the press. When Kolmacâs staff insisted that he take the test, he decided to leave the program.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d2]||||||\n+++\n\nIn August, Hunter and Hallie went to the Hamptons with Hallieâs children. They texted constantly after getting back, and Hunter started to spend most nights in Delaware, at Hallieâs house, watching television until very late. âWe were sharing a very specific grief,â Hunter recalled. âI started to think of Hallie as the only person in my life who understood my loss.â\n\nThat fall, Hunter made plans to go to the Grace Grove Lifestyle Center, in Sedona, Arizona. During a layover at Los Angeles International Airport, before his connecting flight to Phoenix, he went to a nearby hotel bar and realized that he had left his wallet on the plane. It had belonged to Beau and still contained his attorney-general identification badge, and also Hunterâs driverâs license, without which he couldnât board his flight. Using a credit card he had in his pocket, Hunter checked into a hotel in Marina del Rey, where he waited for the airline to return the wallet.\n\nInstead of going to Grace Grove, Hunter stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. He said that he âneeded a way to forget,â and that, soon after his arrival in L.A., he asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter said that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment, where, in a narrow passageway between tents, someone put a gun to his head before realizing that he was a buyer. He returned to buy more crack a few times that week.\n\nOne night, outside a club on Hollywood Boulevard, Hunter and another man got into an argument, and a group of bouncers intervened. A friend of one of the bouncers, a Samoan man who went by the nickname Baby Down, felt sorry for Hunter and took him to Melâs Drive-In to get some food, and to his hotel to pick up his belongings. Early on the morning of October 26th, Baby Down dropped Hunter off at the Hertz rental office at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nHunter said that, at that point, he had not slept for several days. Driving east on Interstate 10, just beyond Palm Springs, he lost control of his car, which jumped the median and skidded to a stop on the shoulder of the westbound side. He called Hertz, which came to collect the damaged car and gave him a second rental. Later, on a sharp bend on a mountainous road, Hunter recalled, a large barn owl flew over the hood of the car and then seemed to follow him, dropping in front of the headlights. He said that he has no idea whether the owl was real or a hallucination. On the night of October 28th, Hunter dropped the car off at a Hertz office in Prescott, Arizona, and Grace Grove sent a van to pick him up.\n\nZachary Romfo, who worked at the Hertz office in Prescott, told me that he found a crack pipe in the car and, on one of the consoles, a line of white-powder residue. Beau Bidenâs attorney-general badge was on the dashboard. Hertz called the Prescott police department, and officers there filed a ânarcotics offenseâ report, listing the items seized from the car, including a plastic baggie containing a âwhite powdery substance,â a Secret Service business card, credit cards, and Hunterâs driverâs license. Later, according to a police report, Secret Service agents informed Prescott police that Hunter was âsecure/well.â Subsequent test results indicated that the glass pipe contained cocaine residue, but investigators didnât find any fingerprints on it. Public prosecutors in the county and the city declined to bring a case against Hunter, citing a lack of evidence that the pipe had been used by him. Jon Paladini, Prescottâs city attorney, told me that he was not aware of any requests by officials in Washington to drop the investigation into Hunter. âItâs a very Republican area,â he said. âI donât think political favors, necessarily, would even work, had they been requested.â\n\nAfter a week at Grace Grove, Hunter checked into a resort spa called Mii Amo, and called Hallie, who flew to meet him. During her stay, Hunter said, they decided to become a couple. When they returned to Delaware, they tried, unsuccessfully, to keep their relationship secret.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, Kathleen filed for divorce, and on February 23, 2017, she filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunterâs assets, alleging that he âcreated financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.â The motion was leaked to the New York _Post_, along with the revelation that Hunter and Hallie were dating.\n\nKathleen told friends that she felt ostracized by the Biden family. Hunter denied hiring prostitutes, and said that he hadnât been to a strip club in years. But, he said, the evening the story was published, âI went directly to a strip club. I said, âFuck them.âÂ â\n\nThe first that Biden heard of the relationship was when the _Post_ asked his office for comment. Hunter issued a statement saying that he and Hallie were âincredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time.â Hunter told me he appealed to his father to make a statement, too: âI said, âDad, Dad, you have to.â He said, âHunter, I donât know if I should. But Iâll do whatever you want me to do.â I said, âDad, if people find out, but they think youâre not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong. The kids have to know, Dad, that thereâs nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you.âÂ â A former Biden aide confirmed that Biden agreed to issue a statement because of concerns about Hunterâs well-being. Biden told the _Post_, âWe are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness.Â .Â .Â . They have mine and Jillâs full and complete support and we are happy for them.â The _Post_ ran the statement under the headline *âBeau Bidenâs Widow Having Affair with His Married Brother.â*{: .small}\n\nIn August, Hunter rented a house in Annapolis, Maryland, where he, Hallie, and her two children hoped to have some privacy, but, several months later, they split up. âAll we got was shit from everybody, all the time,â Hunter said. âIt was really hard. And I realized that Iâm not helping anybody by sticking around.â (Hallie declined to comment.) In early 2018, he moved to Los Angeles. The idea, he said, was to âcompletely disappear.â\n\nHunter said that, in divorce proceedings, he offered to give Kathleen âeverything,â including a monthly payment of thirty-seven thousand dollars for alimony, tuition, and child-care costs for a decade. Hunter told me that he was living on approximately four thousand dollars a month; he was hardly poor, but it was an adjustment. On occasion, transactions on his credit cards were declined.\n\nOne of Kathleenâs motions contains a reference to âa large diamondâ that had come into Hunterâs possession. The motion seems to imply that it was one of Hunterâs âpersonal indulgences.â When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars.\n\nHunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Yeâs company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunterâs hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. âI was, like, Oh, my God,â Hunter said. (In Kathleenâs court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: âWhat would they be bribing me for? My dad wasnât in office.â Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesnât know what they did with it. âI knew it wasnât a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,â he said.\n\nHunter began negotiating a deal for CEFC to invest forty million dollars in a liquefied-natural-gas project on Monkey Island, in Louisiana, which, he said, was projected to create thousands of jobs. âI was more proud of it than you can imagine,â he told me. In the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a âshady character at all,â and characterized the outcome as âbad luck.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJoe Biden is hardly the first politician to have faced scrutiny for the business dealings of a family member. In 1973, during the Watergate investigation, the Washington _Post_ reported that [Richard Nixon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-nixon) had the phone of his brother Donald tapped for at least a year, because he feared that Donaldâs âvarious financial activities might bring embarrassment to the Nixon administration.â In the late seventies, the F.B.I. investigated President [Jimmy Carter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jimmy-carter)âs younger brother, Billy, after it emerged that he was on the payroll of the Libyan government. In an extensive report on the affair issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Biden was a member, Billy was quoted as saying that âhe did not need anyone in Washington telling him how to conduct his private business.â Carter said that he had tried, unsuccessfully, to âdiscourage Billy from making any other trip to Libyaâ and âto keep him out of the newspapers for a few weeks.â\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d168899f2cdba00092a45b9]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nBidenâs approach was to deal with Hunterâs activities by largely ignoring them. This may have temporarily allowed Biden to truthfully inform reporters that his decisions were not affected by Hunter. But, as Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, âItâs hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunterâs foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunterâs relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.â\n\nIt is clear that Hunter and Bidenâs decades-old decision not to discuss business matters has exposed both father and son to attacks. (Biden declined to comment for this article.) In March of last year, Peter Schweizer, a conservative researcher and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart, published âSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.â Schweizer is best known for âClinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Clinton Rich,â which was released in May, 2015\\. Research for that book was funded by the Government Accountability Institute, which Schweizer co-founded, in 2012, with Stephen Bannon. Under the law, the G.A.I. is a nonpartisan organization. But, as Joshua Green wrote, in âDevilâs Bargain,â his book about Bannonâs role in Trumpâs rise, Bannon saw âClinton Cashâ as âthe key to orchestrating Hillary Clintonâs downfall.â It was, Green writes, âthe culmination of everything Bannon learned during his time in Goldman Sachs, Internet Gaming Entertainment, Hollywood, and Breitbart News.â\n\nAs Bannon and Schweizer had hoped, investigative journalists from the mainstream press followed up on Schweizerâs many examples of the Clintonsâ purported conflicts of interest. In April, 2015, two weeks before Schweizerâs book came out, the _Times_ published a front-page article, by Jo Becker and Mike McIntire, that cited Schweizerâs research alongside Beckerâs own reporting from 2008\\. The article singled out a Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra, who donated tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The story suggested that the donations of Giustra and others might have created conflicts of interest, at a time when the Obama Administration was negotiating to allow the Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to gain control of a swath of Americaâs untapped uranium deposits by purchasing the Canadian company Uranium One. The _Times_ was criticized for building on Schweizerâs work, and, two years later, Eileen Sullivan, in another _Times_ article, wrote, âThere has been no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced the Uranium One deal.â Still, âClinton Cashâ did exactly what Bannon hoped it would do, Green writes, âsullying Clintonâs image in a way that she never fully recovered from.â\n\nâSecret Empires,â which details Hunterâs activities in China and Ukraine, focusses on what Schweizer calls âcorruption by proxy,â which he defines as a ânew corruptionâ that is âdifficult to detectâ and that, though often legal, makes âgood money for a politician and his family and friendsâ and leaves âAmerican politicians vulnerable to overseas financial pressure.â Schweizer often relies on innuendo to supplement his reporting. At one point, he describes âone of the few public sightingsâ of Hunter in Beijing, when Hunter, âdressed in a dark overcoat,â followed Biden into a shop to buy a Magnum ice cream. âIntentionally or not,â Schweizer writes, âHunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had _guanxi_ââconnections.\n\nSchweizer asserts that âRosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.â In fact, the deal had been signed before the tripâaccording to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterwardâand Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasnât with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was âlucrativeâ for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn October, 2017, the special counsel [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, indicted Paul Manafort, Trumpâs former campaign chairman, on twelve counts, including committing conspiracy against the United States by failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine. (Manafort pleaded guilty to that charge in September, 2018.) Making a case that Hunter had his own Ukrainian scandal, Schweizer implies that Joe Biden had been consulted in advance about Hunter and Archerâs work with Burisma. On April 16, 2014, he notes, shortly before the announcement that Hunter and Archer had taken seats on the companyâs board, Archer made a âprivate visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice-President Biden.â Hunter, Archer, and Archerâs son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-Presidentâs hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed.\n\nRudolph Giuliani, Trumpâs personal lawyer, has also aggressively promoted what he has called the âalleged Ukraine conspiracyâ in interviews and on social media. Giuliani told me that, in the fall of 2018, he spoke to Viktor Shokin, Ukraineâs former prosecutor general. Shokin told him that Vice-President Biden had him fired in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma and the companyâs payments to Hunter and Archer. Giuliani said that, in January, 2019, he met with Yurii Lutsenko, Ukraineâs current prosecutor general, in New York, and Lutsenko confirmed Shokinâs version of events.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, John Solomon, an opinion contributor to _The Hill,_ wrote about Shokinâs claim that he had been conducting a corruption probe into Burisma and Hunter when he was dismissed. A month later, the _Times_ reported that Hunter âwas on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.â The story, by KennethÂ P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel, provoked some Democrats to express concern that the _Times_ was again lending credence to allegations made by Schweizer and other Trump allies. Giuliani retweeted the article, and Trump called for the Justice Department to investigate. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Obama, tweeted, âZero lessons have been learned from 2016: 1\\. Mainstream outlet credulously accepts Trump conspiracy about opponent 2\\. Trump propaganda machine uses story to spread the conspiracy on social media and through digital ads 3\\. Voters believe it, ignoring subsequent fact checks.â\n\nThere is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokinâs removal in order to protect Hunter. According to Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administrationâs special envoy for energy policy, Shokin was removed because of concerns by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the U.S. government that he wasnât pursuing corruption investigations. Contrary to the assertions that Shokin was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Zlochevsky, Hochstein said, âmany of us in the U.S. government believed that Shokin was the one protecting Zlochevsky.â In May, Giuliani scheduled a visit to Ukraine, and told the _Times_ that he would look into Hunterâs involvement with Burisma, âbecause that information will be very, very helpful to my client,â but then abruptly cancelled the trip, amid reports that Ukraineâs President-elect was unwilling to meet with him. A week later, on May 16th, Lutsenko appeared to shift his position on Burisma, telling Bloomberg News that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, and that âa company can pay however much it wants to its board.â The reasons for his reversal were unclear, but Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, in Kiev, speculated that Lutsenko, in talking with Giuliani, had been trying to âpump his political muscle,â a strategy that had proved ineffective in the new political climate.\n\nThat month, Hunter declined Burismaâs offer to serve another term on the board, believing that the controversy had become a distraction. But he said that he was proud of his work there, and that he thought the criticism was misplaced. âI feel the decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me,â he told me. âWas it worth it? Was it worth the pain? No. It certainly wasnât worth the grief.â He went on, âI would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.â\n\nAnd yet, to many voters, the controversy over Hunterâs business dealings will appear to have been avoidable, a product of Bidenâs resistance to having difficult conversations, particularly those involving his family. Hunter said that, in his talks with his father, âIâm saying sorry to him, and he says, âIâm the one whoâs sorry,â and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, âLook, itâs going to go away.â There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away. So can you survive the assault?â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn early May, Hunter met a thirty-two-year-old South African woman named Melissa Cohen, a filmmaker who was working on a series of documentaries about indigenous tribes in southern Africa. A few days after their first date, Hunter had the word âshalomâ tattooed in Hebrew letters on the inside of his left bicep, to match a tattoo that Cohen has in the same spot. On May 15th, less than a week after they met, he proposed. The next morning, she accepted, and he bought the simplest gold wedding bands he could find, then called a marriage service, which sent over an officiant.\n\nA month later, on the roof deck of Cohenâs apartment, off the Sunset Strip, Cohen sat on a bench next to Hunter, who was wearing jeans and a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan *âBE FUCKING NICE.â*{: .small} Hunter recalled that, after the ceremony, âI called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, âThank you for giving my son the courage to love again.âÂ â Hunter paused, his eyes filling with tears. âAnd he said to me, âHoney, I knew that when you found love again that Iâd get you back.âÂ â Cohen rubbed his shoulders. He went on, âAnd my reply was, I said, âDad, I always had love. And the only thing that allowed me to see it was the fact that you never gave up on me, you always believed in me.âÂ â\n\nHunter told me that, on a recent evening, he had seen reports on Twitter that Trump was calling for him to be investigated by the Justice Department. Then Hunter noticed a helicopter overhead. âI said, âI hope theyâre taking pictures of us right now. I hope itâs a live feed to the President so he can see just how much I care about the tweets.âÂ â He went on, âI told Melissa, âI donât care. Fuck you, Mr. President. Here I am, living my life.âÂ âÂ â¦\n\nA previous version of this article misspelled Brian McGlincheyâs last name and mischaracterized the New York _Times_â interaction with Peter Schweizer and its reporting on Uranium One.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"},{"id":"5c2e1cd1ee7fe02cbd1633a7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sons","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sons"},{"id":"5c2e1c7736cecf40192141c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidential Candidates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidential-candidates"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca722d4972cd5b832c6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drugs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drugs"},{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hunter Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hunter-biden"}],"sections":[{"id":"5944867342fa443beba19b29","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5a6100548bcd0613d5da686f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Entous joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering intelligence, national security, and foreign affairs.

The more you delve into the story, the more it reads like something Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen cobbled together after a guysâ getaway to Kiev. To make the selection a bit easier, letâs make it a multiple-choice question:\n\n> (a) Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, whom the *Wall Street Journal* politely describes as âFlorida businessmen who are U.S. citizens born in former Soviet republics,â were both carrying one-way tickets out of the country when federal agents [arrested them](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rudy-giulianis-relationship-arrested-men-subject-criminal-investigation/story?id=66212654) at Dulles International Airport, on Wednesday night, and charged them with breaking campaign-finance laws by disguising donations from foreign entities.\n\n> (b) Parnas, a forty-seven-year-old native of Ukraine who arrived in the United States in 1976, owns a company called Fraud Guarantee. Evidently, itâs some sort of fraud-prevention advisory service. According to [the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-associates.html), this company paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for âbusiness and legal advice.â\n\n> (c) According to [Buzzfeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikesallah/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-trump-parnas-fruman), Parnas has in the past âworked for three stockbrokerages that were later expelled by regulators for fraud and other violationsâthough he was never individually chargedâand racked up nine court judgments for failing to pay loans and other debts.â\n\n> (d) Parnas once tried to produce a movie called âAnatomy of an Assassin.â It didnât go well. âMr. Parnas is a con man, he is a crook,â Dianne Pues, a New Jersey woman who invested in the project, [told](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235626327.html) the Miami *Herald*. âHe conned us from day one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He financially ruined us.â\n\n> (e) As he travelled around doing whatever he did, Parnas didnât stint on expenses. âThere were bills running to hundreds of dollars at exclusive restaurants such as Novikov in London and BLT Prime in Washington,â Buzzfeed [reported](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikesallah/ukraine-spending-trump-parnas-fruman). âDuring one of his many trips to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, there was a $657 charge at Tootsie, the popular strip club in the heart of the city.â\n\n> (f) Fruman, a fifty-three-year-old native of Belarus, apparently runs an import-export business that ships goods to and from Ukraine. He also reportedly owned, or owns, a beach club in the Black Sea city of Odessa, which has long been a stronghold of organized crime. The name of the club: Mafia Rave.\n\n> (g) In the spring of last year, after the dynamic duo donated three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to America First Action, a super *PAC*{:.small} that supports Donald Trump, they were invited to the White House, where they had dinner with the President and got [their pictures](https://twitter.com/propublica/status/1182357387279323139) taken with him. âThank you President Trump !!! Making America great !!!!!! incredible dinner and even better conversation,â Parnas posted on his Facebook account.\n\n> (h) On Thursday, Trump said, âI donât know those gentlemen.â\n\nAs I said, itâs a tough choice. On human-interest grounds, Iâm choosing Option D, but the grip-and-grin picture of Parnas and Trump at the White House is also pricelessâas is a picture of him having coffee with Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington last month. And letâs not forget the shot of Fruman and Parnas having breakfast in Beverly Hills last year with Donald Trump, Jr., and Tommy Hicks, Jr., a friend of Trump, Jr., who was then running America First Action.\n\nBut humor and Schadenfreude aside, this is a deadly serious matter. While there is still a good deal of murk surrounding the activities of Fruman and Parnas, we do know that they were two very busy and well-connected fellows. In addition to doing some of Giulianiâs bidding in Ukraine, as he sought to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Parnas got hired by a law firm run by two other Trump supporters and frequent Fox News guests, Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing. According to the [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188), the law firm âhired Mr. Parnas in July to serve as an interpreter related to their representation of Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch, who was detained in Vienna, in 2014, on corruption charges filed in the U.S.â\n\nMeanwhile, Parnas and Fruman were also representing, and acting at the behest of, at least two Eastern European parties who havenât yet been identified. The [indictment](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/U.S.v.LevParnasetalIndictment.pdf?mod=article_inline) says that their political donations, some of which were routed through shell companies to hide their identities, âwere made for the purpose of gaining influence with politicians so as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.â \n\nWho was this Ukrainian official, and what did he or she want? Thatâs one of the things we donât know yet, but the indictment says that Parnas met with a U.S. congressman, widely believed to be the former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions, and sought his âassistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. ambassador to UkraineââMarie Yovanovitchâand these âefforts to remove the Ambassador were conducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.â \n\nWe also know that the other Eastern European who was employing Parnas and Fruman is Russian. The indictment says that some of the donations that Fruman, Parnas, and two other individuals made in 2018 were really funded by a certain âForeign National-1,â with a view to obtaining licenses for a recreational-marijuana business in certain U.S. states, including Nevada. One of the other conspirators is quoted in the indictment, and he says Foreign National-1âs identity was kept hidden because of âhis Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.â\n\nWhat does all this add up to? Although Parnas and Fruman hardly appear to fit the bill of men of international intrigue, they clearly played significant roles in the Giuliani-inspired effort to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens, get rid of Yovanovitch, and help Donald Trump get reÃ«lected. That means they are potentially important witnesses in the Presidential-impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Democrats who are investigating Trump will most certainly want to hear what Parnas and Fruman have to say. (At least one House committee has already served a subpoena on them.) And, according to ABC News, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the campaign-finance case against Parnas and Fruman, is also investigating their business relationship with Giuliani. Thatâs not good news for Rudy or Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Virginia ordered the pair to be held in detention until they [secure](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-10-10-2019/h_10c49544ade8af0943742f340e377f13) a bail bond of a million dollars each. Right now, they are being represented by John Dowd, a former lawyer for Trump, which would suggest they arenât about to turn on their former associates and spill. But, like Michael Cohen, they could always have a change of heart.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rudy Giuliani","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rudy-giuliani"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

Bush Administration, despite the fact that she had championed some of the Trump Administrationâs harshest immigration policies, including family separation. McAleenan, who had served in the Obama Administration, was widely regarded as a Democrat. He publicly opposed Trumpâs decision, earlier that spring, to [cut aid to Central America](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-cycle-of-self-sabotage-at-the-us-border), and was taking over the Department at a moment when more than a hundred thousand migrants were being apprehended at the border in a single month. On Friday, after six months in the post, McAleenan resigned, becoming one of the shortest-serving secretaries in the departmentâs history. And yet, according to three people with knowledge of McAleenanâs thinking, the Secretary had somehow managed to leave the Trump Administration mostly on his own terms. The reasoning behind the decision, one of them told me, âwas sixty per cent because he had achieved the mission objectives, and forty per cent because he had to avoid being branded as Trumpâs border cop.â\n\nMcAleenanâs primary goal was reducing immigration to the U.S., which aligned him with the White House. But, unlike Trump or his chief adviser, Stephen Miller, McAleenan was never an anti-immigration ideologue. He is a technocrat and an institutionalist who had spent much of his career at Customs and Border Protection, a D.H.S. sub-agency. In his view, mass migration was a humanitarian crisis which threatened to overtake both D.H.S. resources and the asylum system writ large. It was a problem, he once told me, that partisan Washington was unable to address. At the same time, according to another department official close to him, McAleenan saw Trumpâs election as proof that an unsolved immigration crisis could carry dangerous political consequences. \n\nIn terms of immigration numbers, though, McAleenan succeeded where his predecessors failed. He was the fourth person to lead the department in the Trump era but the first with extensive experience on immigration policy. âI wouldnât make a move or decision in the immigration space without consulting Kevin first,â Jeh Johnson, who headed D.H.S. under President Obama, told me. Each of McAleenanâs predecessors, under sustained pressure from the White House, adopted drastic immigration measures, but immigration at the southern border continued to rise steadily. By the start of 2019, it reached its highest levels in more than a decade. McAleenan responded with a controversial slate of policies that enlisted governments in Central America and Mexico to ramp up their own immigration enforcement. By September, the number of immigrants apprehended at the southern border had declined by sixty-three per cent.\n\nTrump never exactly soured on McAleenan, but he undercut him. For one thing, the President did not formally nominate McAleenan for Senate confirmation, which eroded his standing within the Administration. D.H.S. consists of twenty-two agencies, with an annual budget of fifty billion dollars and some two hundred and forty thousand employees, spanning the Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (*FEMA*{: .small}), the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (*ICE*{: .small}). Its portfolio includes briefs related to domestic terrorism, cybersecurity, and disaster relief. âWe always had to work extremely hard to make sure the department didnât get turned into a political tool,â one former D.H.S. official [told](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-became-one-of-president-trumps-fiercest-loyalists) me last year. âWe tried to run it like other departments that were above the fray, but itâll always be a challenge because of the immigration issue.â Among many current and former D.H.S. officials, however, there was rising concern that the Presidentâs obsessive focus on immigration enforcement was dragging the department even further into the realm of domestic politics. At one point earlier this summer, Trump bumped into McAleenan in Washington just before the secretary was due to give a speech on cybersecurity. âWhy arenât you at the border?â Trump asked him, according to someone present at the time. \n\nIn June, Trump named two partisan appointees to key posts within D.H.S.âKen Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general, to lead Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, to head C.B.P.âboth of whom routinely sidestepped McAleenan, their direct boss, in press conferences and appearances on Fox News. This summer, while McAleenan was negotiating an emergency funding bill on the Hillâin part, by trying to convince restive Democrats that D.H.S. would use appropriations for humanitarian, not enforcement, effortsâCuccinelli and Morgan publicly championed a nationwide *ICE*{: .small} operation that the President had announced, to the agencyâs surprise, on Twitter. McAleenan had opposed the operation, which targeted immigrant families, but Cuccinelli and Morgan rallied to the cause. âWhat I donât have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,â McAleenan later told the Washington *Post*. âThatâs uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.â \n\nBut if McAleenan passed as a moderate steward of D.H.S. in the context of Trumpâs Washingtonâa policy wonk and diplomat, who was data-driven and cautiousâby almost any other standard, his tenure was marked by aggressive measures that have wreaked havoc on the lives of migrants. During the past six months, McAleenan has presided over two elaborate new policies designed to enlist foreign governments in the effort to take pressure off of the U.S. asylum system. The first, called the [Migrant Protection Protocols](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-the-us-asylum-system-is-keeping-migrants-at-risk-in-mexico) (M.P.P.), came into existence while McAleenan was the head of C.B.P. It has since forced some fifty thousand Central American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their legal claims move through the backlogged U.S. immigration courts. Initially, the program was designed to handle the influx of Central Americans, but late this spring, under McAleenanâs leadership, D.H.S. broadened M.P.P. to include asylum seekers from any Spanish-speaking country in Latin America. McAleenan has defended M.P.P. as a necessary stopgap to allow asylum seekers access to U.S. immigration courts, while keeping them off American soil. In practice, however, hundreds of asylum seekers have been brutalized while stranded in notoriously dangerous Mexican border cities, and thousands of others, out of fear for their safety, have abandoned their asylum claims altogether. \n\nOver the summer, I spoke to a twenty-two-year-old Guatemalan named Deysi, whose asylum claim was promising even by the strictest legal definitions of the term. A lesbian whoâd been raped and assaulted repeatedly in her home town, in southern Guatemala, she travelled to El Paso to seek relief at a port of entry, and was eventually returned to JuÃ¡rez, under M.P.P., on the same day that McAleenan took over at D.H.S. She slept in a park because the cityâs shelters were full. âI knew I had a court date,â she said in a subsequent affidavit. âBut I had no paper with the date, the time, and what I need to do to get to court.â By the end of May, sheâd missed her court appearance and run out of money. At that point, she tried crossing the border between points of entry and was arrested by Border Patrol agents. Since sheâd missed her previous court hearing, she now had an order of removal. When we spoke, Deysi was back in Guatemala, desperate to leave but too scared to set out again for the U.S. \n\nThe other defining feature of McAleenanâs tenure has been a series of accords known as safe-third-country agreements, which, since July, D.H.S. has [signed with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-asylum-have-a-future-at-the-southern-border). Each of these deals will bar migrants from applying for asylum in the U.S. if they have first passed through one of these three Central American countries. Currently, more than ninety per cent of migrants apprehended at the U.S. border are fleeing these countries. They are far from âsafeâ for migrants, and none of them has a fully functioning asylum system.\n\nThe agreements are designed to send a message to the regionâs asylum seekers that if they travel north, the U.S. will no longer be their ultimate destination, a senior D.H.S. official told me. Itâs an unconventional version of a familiar argument: deterring migrants from travelling to the U.S. has been the through line of U.S. border policy for decades, linking Republican and Democratic Administrations. McAleenan, for his part, has insisted that there are other upsides to the agreements. They will open the door to tens of millions of dollars in aid to build up asylum infrastructure in Central America; in exchange for regional coÃ¶peration, the U.S. will increase the number of temporary work visas available to migrants as well. But ending asylum at the southern border requires rejecting the legitimacy of thousands of future claims. âEvery person Iâve ever met at C.B.P. fundamentally believes that ninety-nine per cent of asylum claims are what a smuggler convinced people to say,â one Administration official told me, referring to the Secretaryâs background. âMcAleenan is comfortable with effectively ending asylum because he thinks a lot of these claims are fraudulent.â \n\nMcAleenan has defended the implementation of M.P.P., and the continued â[metering](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-long-wait-for-tijuanas-migrants-to-process-their-own-asylum-claims)â of asylum seekers at official ports of entry, by pointing out that no one else has yet managed to offer a holistic solution to the Central American exodus while preserving the key tenets of U.S. asylum law. But his initiatives have come with an irreparable human cost. âAgain and again, under his leadership, the Department of Homeland Security has evaded U.S. asylum laws and policies designed to protect men, women, and children from persecution and comply with this countryâs treaty commitments,â Eleanor Acer, of Human Rights First, told me. âInstead of a system that assesses whether people meet the requirements of U.S. refugee protection, the U.S. now has a system designed to evade U.S. refugee law, block as many as possible from asylum in our country, and terrify others into abandoning their requests for protection.â\n\nOne of McAleenanâs few regrets was his initial support for the zero-tolerance policy that gave rise to family separation. He co-wrote the memo recommending the policy to Nielsen, in the spring of 2018. He described his original rationale, in an interview he gave to the Washington *Post*. âHow can we let these smugglers victimize these desperate families,â he said. âHow can we let this flow continue to grow.â Family separation was supposed to have a deterrent effect. It [didnât work](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/will-anyone-in-the-trump-administration-ever-be-held-accountable-for-the-zero-tolerance-policy), and instead tortured thousands of families in the process. âWhen you see the impact in the six-week period on two thousand and five hundred or so families and understand the emotional pain for those children, itâs not worth it,â McAleenan would later say. âItâs the one part of this whole thing that I couldnât ever be part of again.â \n\nFor now, it seems likely that either Cuccinelli or Morgan will replace McAleenan. Both of them have been auditioning for the job for months. With either of them at the helm, D.H.S. runs the risk of becoming an overt arm of the Trump reÃ«lection campaign, which is a genuinely frightening prospect. Going into 2020, the Trump Administration faces a messaging dilemma when it comes to immigration policy: the President has campaigned on the idea that the U.S. border is being overrun, but since the Administration has effectively [ended asylum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-immigration-attorney-at-the-aclu-on-fighting-trumps-asylum-ban) there isnât an obvious case to fuel the sense of emergency. Neither Cuccinelli nor Morgan has any grasp of policy, but theyâre in their element as the Presidentâs spokesmenâthreatening mass roundups, boasting about enforcement operations, and unquestioningly parroting falsehoods from the White House. That is what Trump clearly wants, even more than the results he was able to get with McAleenan. Weâll never know all the outlandish policies McAleenan probably had to avert, redirect, or quietly defuse during his tenure at D.H.S. Now, without him there, weâre about to find out.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Immigration","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"immigration"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Nearly all of them had been deported from the United States in the previous six months, including the pastor, Mabel GonzÃ¡lez. She had been [separated](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-uncounted-families-torn-apart-at-the-border-by-the-trump-administration) from two of her children in September of 2017, in El Paso, where she was detained for more than a year. Now she was calling the group to prayer with an exhortation: âYou have to say, âIâm not going to let anything bad overtake me.â&nbsp;â The room was small and dimly lit, with pocked floors, bare walls, and a fold-out table littered with empty juice bottles; a small pink fan wheezed in the corner. Seated in a half circle, members of the group shared stories of their time in U.S. detention. âIâm still traumatized,â Luis Bonilla, a man in his early forties, said. Heâd been transferred among detention centers in Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia, and, after falling gravely ill while in custody, he signed whatâs called a voluntary-departure order, abandoning his asylum claim. âI couldnât take it anymore,â he said. âAnd now I have to go back! It gives me the chills. It enrages me. But I canât stay at home. We are living the crisis in Honduras in the flesh.â\n\nThose Hondurans came to mind last week, when the Department of Homeland Security announced the latest in a series of accords that it has been signing with nations in Central America. Known as safe-third-country agreements, they will force migrants travelling to the U.S. to apply for asylum in the first country they enter on their route. Then, if they reach American soil, the U.S. government, rather than allowing them to apply for asylum in this country, will be able to send them back to that first (i.e., third) country, on the grounds that they should have pursued their claims there. The latest signatory was Honduras, whose government, led by President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez, is notorious for corruption and repression. He himself has been accused of bankrolling past political campaigns with drug money, and his brother is currently standing [trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/world/americas/el-chapo-honduras-drug-trial.html) in New York on drug-trafficking charges. (President HernÃ¡ndez has denied any involvement in drug crimes; his brother has pleaded not guilty.) Since 2013, when HernÃ¡ndez became President, tens of thousands of Hondurans have left the country, to escape gang violence, a cratered economy, and political mismanagement. This past year, roughly two hundred thousand Hondurans have been apprehended at the U.S. border. \n\nUnder the new agreements, which are set to go into effect sometime in the coming months, the U.S. will be sending asylum seekers to the same countries that most of the regionâs migrants are already fleeing. In addition to Honduras, this is true of Guatemala and El Salvador, with which the U.S. signed analogous agreements in July and September, respectively. During the past year, ninety-two per cent of all immigrants apprehended at the southern border were families from these three countries; none of them has an asylum system capable of handling an influx of tens of thousands of people. In Guatemala, according to [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/guatemala-safe-refugees-and-asylum-seekers), there are twelve government officials working on the asylum process, and only three who conduct asylum interviews. Last year, the government approved just twenty asylum claims. \n\nThe implementation of the agreements still needs to be worked out, but the terms create an interlocking set of restrictions on the flow of migrants to the U.S. Hondurans and Salvadorans will have to apply for asylum in Guatemala. Asylum seekers from elsewhere in Latin America will be forced to stop in El Salvador or Honduras. For the time being, they are the southernmost countries to have signed safe-third-country agreements. This summer, the Department of Homeland Security tried to negotiate a deal with Panamaâwhich officials describe as the âchokepoint of the isthmusââbut the government balked. If a deal with Mexico goes through, as the Administration hopes, Guatemalans will have to seek asylum there. \n\nWhen I sat down with the Honduran migrants, only the Guatemalan deal had been signed, and the U.S. governmentâs broader plans for the region were still an abstract prospect. The reason the Hondurans were in Tapachula was to apply for visas so that they could move through Mexico to the U.S. After being deported back to Honduras, they had travelled north immediately. Stopping in Guatemala wasnât an option. They knew the country, having travelled through it multiple times; they had bribed border agents there and ducked local criminals. In addition, jobs were nonexistent there, which was why more people were leaving Guatemala than Honduras, and the Honduran gangs that many in the group were fleeing also had extensive operations in Guatemala. Mexico hadnât been much better. Violence against migrants has raged for years, particularly in areas controlled by the cartels, and a Trump Administration policy called the [Migrant Protection Protocols](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-the-us-asylum-system-is-keeping-migrants-at-risk-in-mexico) has exacerbated the situation along Mexicoâs northern border. A former bank teller in his early twenties, named Henry, who was seeking to make the trip north with his wife and toddler, told me, âI did some field work here, but they took advantage of me because I was a foreigner.â For fourteen hoursâ labor, he was paid eighty pesos, roughly four U.S. dollars. The only person in the group who had found viable work, doing construction and carpentry, is now trying to leave Tapachula, because a local group has begun extorting him. \n\nThere are two currents now shaping U.S. immigration policy in the Trump Administration. One emanates from Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of D.H.S., who is the architect of the safe-third-country agreements. (His days in the job may be numbered, however. He recently told the Washington *Post*, âWhat I donât have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time.â) The other comes from the White House, where, the *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html) this week, the President has called for electrified fences, skin-piercing spikes, and alligator-filled moats to keep migrants from crossing the border, and his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, has been crafting the most punishing policies to come out of the executive branch in decades. In July, while D.H.S. officials were negotiating the terms of the agreement with Guatemala, the White House went ahead and issued  a regulation that would effectively end asylum altogether. The regulation states that, unless asylum seekers at the southern border have already tried to apply for asylum in another country, they will be turned away. (A federal judge immediately blocked it, but last month the Supreme Court [allowed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-immigration-attorney-at-the-aclu-on-fighting-trumps-asylum-ban) the policy to go into effect while it is being challenged in court.) The move was typical of the White House, in that it ignored the potential fallout in Central America. McAleenanâs strategy shares the same core logic of curtailing asylum at the U.S. border, but, he says, he has tried to engage with the larger issues. This summer, in Guatemala City, where he was meeting with local groups to sell the safe-third-country deal, he told reporters, âYou canât address migration flows at a single destination point. Youâve got to have a partnership between the source, transit, and destination countries. The history, globally, of irregular migration has proven that.â In the past several months, through a separate series of security accords signed with other countries in the region, he achieved significant results: the number of people apprehended at the border each month has dropped by two-thirds, mostly owing to enforcement initiatives undertaken with Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nHow should the U.S. be responding to migrants like those I met in Tapachula? By the limited terms of current U.S. asylum law, few of them have claims that would win in immigration court. And, since many of them have been deported before, the chance that they might gain lawful entry this time is unlikely. In defense of the safe-third-country agreements, the Department of Homeland Security argues that the asylum system is being flooded by claims that will be rejected anyway. âThe bulk of these people are economic migrants,â a senior Administration official told me, and as such, under current U.S. law, they do not qualify for legal protection. At the same time, the government also views people fleeing gang or domestic violence, who make up the vast majority of asylum cases from Central America, as largely ineligible as well. Here the legal reasoning is that asylum seekers must belong to âparticular social groupâ and be persecuted because of their identity or political beliefs. While immigration jurisprudence has expanded slightly over the years to broaden the understanding of what constitutes such a âsocial group,â the Trump Administrationâs Department of Justice has worked relentlessly to reverse such gains. âOnly ten to fifteen per cent of the Central Americans seeking asylum in the U.S. actually get it,â the official told me, and if the government does not try to curb the flow, authorities at the border will continue to be overwhelmed by more migrants than the system was ever equipped to handle. So, âthe short-term goalâ of the safe-third-country deals âis deterrence,â the official said, but added that âthe long-term goal is to set the stage for investment and development in the region. There has to be a way for people to live in the hemisphere. It canât just be the U.S. and Canada.â \n\nAccording to the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/acting-homeland-security-chief-frustrated-and-isolated--even-as-he-delivers-what-trump-wants-at-the-border/2019/10/01/b62e740c-e3ad-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html), âMcAleenan sees the accords as an alternative to the presidentâs previous impulse to cut off the region entirely.â The deal with Guatemala was supposed to include benefits for Guatemalans, in the form of promises to âdouble or tripleâ the five thousand temporary agricultural visas currently issued by the U.S. each year. Thereâs also a proposal to build the countryâs asylum capacity, taken from a plan drafted last year by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will allocate forty-seven million dollars designed to help the country build shelters, hire more staff to handle claims, and open more asylum offices. But whether these proposals are realistic and can be implemented anytime soon is an open question; Guatemala has not yet instituted any such plans. \n\nIn fact, although the senior official I spoke with stressed that the accords were a step toward âmaking regional governments more accountable and responsiveâ to the issue of migration, the effect so far seems to have been opportunism from the leaders of the countries involved. Earlier this summer, the  Constitutional Court in Guatemala had blocked the President, Jimmy Morales, from signing the agreement without the approval of the national Congress. Morales, who will leave office in January, was trying to finalize the deal because âhe wanted to end his time as close as he could to the U.S.,â someone with knowledge of the negotiations told me. (Members of his family were tried on corruption charges, but were cleared in August; Morales himself faced investigation for alleged campaign-finance improprieties, which he denied.) After the Court checked Morales, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the country, and Morales signed the agreement in direct contravention of the Courtâs order. A few weeks later, in August, Guatemala held the second round of its Presidential [elections](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-administrations-self-defeating-policy-toward-the-guatemalan-elections). The winner was Alejandro Giammattei, a right-wing  former national-prison director, who had publicly opposed the safe-third-country deal but has privately assured the U.S that he will allow it to proceed, according to someone with knowledge of his position. In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele was seemingly so eager to curry favor with the Trump Administration that he accepted the deal without bothering to push for significant concessions. There are currently two hundred thousand Salvadorans living in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status, which the Trump Administration has tried to cancel. According to another senior Administration official, Bukele signed the deal even though the U.S. refused, outright, to extend T.P.S. for these Salvadorans. \n\nThere is a crisis facing the U.S. asylum system, and itâs been decades in the making. But ending asylum as we know it creates a crisis all its own. GonzÃ¡lez, the Honduran pastor, is now living two hours outside of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, in northern Mexico. Her mother, husband, and children are in the U.S.; a nephew whoâd also been in Tapachula is joining her; and sheâs hired a lawyer to review her asylum case. Gangsters in Honduras murdered six of her family members over the past two decades, including two of her brothers. She has no more family left in the country. âTheyâve all been killed or driven out,â she said. Earlier this year, after the U.S. deported her, she stayed with the closest person she had there to a relativeâthe mother of another asylum seeker whom she had met in detention, in El Paso.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b81ab3335f580f222","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Honduras","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"honduras"},{"id":"5c2e1f9caef5062c9d94aba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guatemala","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guatemala"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a7e716b454591ae79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Salvador","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-salvador"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

For weeks, the government denied them food and kept them from seeing doctors or family members. The circumstances, one of the girls later told the [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/flores-migrant-children-detention.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmiriam-jordan&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection), were âtoo painful to remember, to discuss.â A team of lawyers who went on to represent them and two other girls sued the government, in a case that dragged on for more than a decade, well after the initial plaintiffs were released. By 1997, two Presidential Administrations later, the government decided to settle. Doris Meissner, who was then the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said, âIf there are real issues surrounding the detention of minors, and the government is being held responsible for poor conditions, why are we litigating in favor of what we are doing wrong?â  \n\nFor the past twenty-two years, the terms of this legal settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, have been a central tenet of U.S. immigration policy. When dealing with children, the most vulnerable immigrants to enter federal custody, the government must provide certain, baseline protections, including access to food and medical care; it must also promise to detain them for the shortest possible amount of time, in the âleast restrictiveâ settings. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a sweeping new set of regulations to gut the Flores Agreement. âIt is a wholesale attack on kids in custody,â Jennifer Podkul, the policy director of Kids in Need of Defense (*KIND*{: .small}), told me. The Administrationâs immediate target is an outgrowth of the agreement, shored up by a judge a few years ago, which prevents children from being held in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security for more than twenty days. The agreement applies not just to children who came to the U.S. alone but also to those who crossed the border with their parents. This has meant, in effect, that thousands of asylum-seeking families have been released from detention while their cases have moved through the immigration courts. Now, according to Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the government will detain families together for as long as it takes to resolve their immigration claims. For tens of thousands of families, that could easily amount to months in custodyâan especially alarming prospect considering that another critical component of Flores, a requirement that the government keep children in licensed facilities overseen by independent monitors, would also fall away under the Administrationâs plan. \n\nIn his announcement on Wednesday, McAleenan claimed that âall children in U.S. government custodyâ would be âtreated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.â But his reassurances sound especially hollow at the present moment. In the past year and a half, seven children have died in immigration custody, and there have been widespread complaints about the conditions in which children are being held. Earlier this summer, at a Border Patrol facility in [Clint](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/inside-a-texas-building-where-the-government-is-holding-immigrant-children), Texas, two hundred and fifty infants, children, and teen-agers spent weeks without adequate food and water, and were denied soap and toothbrushes; despite lice and flu outbreaks, authorities skimped on providing medical care. âThe Flores monitors are the reason we knew about what was happening at Clint,â Podkul said. \n\nOn Monday, a lawyer known as a âspecial master,â who was appointed last year to investigate potential violations of Flores in facilities run by D.H.S. and the Department of Health and Human Services, filed a report with further details. In Customs and Border Protection facilities, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, âallegations of severe overcrowding and excessive length of custody, lack of appropriate food for minors, inability of detainees to sleep, ambient temperatures outside a reasonably comfortable range, and lack of access to medical treatment remain unresolved,â the special master wrote. At H.H.S. shelters across the country, the average time that children spent in government custody, between January of 2018 and May of 2019, was sixty-seven days. Nearly three thousand children who turned eighteen while in detention were transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement because they âaged outâ and were no longer treated as minors.   \n\nThe Trump Administration has, from the start, attacked Flores as a âloopholeâ that immigrant families have continually sought to exploit; closing it was part of a broader mission to deter other families from coming to the U.S. to seek asylum in the first place. In August, 2017, a group of Administration officials [met](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents) at D.H.S. headquarters, in Washington, to devise a series of policies to restrict the number of asylum seekers entering the country. Among the proposals was separating families at the border and a move to end the Flores agreement. Attendees were also tasked with writing ten separate memos with blueprints for how the Administration could implement each policy goal. âI recall being stumped about what we could do by decree or executive action to get around Flores,â one former official, who was present at the meeting, told me. âIt was one of the memos that floundered,â the former official added, because of its âquestionable legality.â \n\nThe White House decided to work around Flores instead. When the Trump Administration began separating families at the border, in the summer of 2017, part of its rationalization was that, by criminally charging parents for entering the country illegally, the government could detain the adults, and their children would be treated as unaccompanied minors and transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. The government could thus hold the parents indefinitely and penalize the entire family, as the children were kept in conditions that were notionally consistent with the terms of Flores. By late June, 2018, amid a national outcry, Trump promised to stop separating families at the border. But, in the same breath, he announced that the Administration would hold families together instead. Almost immediately, a federal judge in California named Dolly Gee, who is in charge of supervising the governmentâs compliance with Flores, blocked the Administration. There was a clear precedent for her decision, which the Trump Administration willfully ignored: in 2015, when President Obama responded to a sudden spike in Central American families seeking asylum by trying to detain families in *ICE*{: .small} facilities, Gee blocked him, too. \n\nIn September, 2018, the Trump Administration released a two-hundred-page document outlining proposed regulations that would end Flores altogether. Immigration advocates immediately appealed to Gee, in California, who took the challenge under advisement but withheld final judgment until after the Administrationâs regulations were entered in the federal register, which is slated for Friday. âThe President is telling [D.H.S.] they must terminate the settlement,â Peter Schey, one of the lead attorneys in the initial Flores class-action suit, [told the Washington *Post* at the time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-to-circumvent-court-limits-on-detention-of-child-migrants/2018/09/06/181d376c-b1bd-11e8-a810-4d6b627c3d5d_story.html). âThey tried it in court, and now theyâre trying it through regulations. But theyâre in a bind, because the only way the regulations will be valid is if theyâre consistent with the settlement, and if theyâre consistent with the settlement then they wonât achieve the changes the President has demanded.â Now the Flores plaintiffs will have a week to amend their suit. Jennifer Nagda, an attorney at the Young Center for Immigrant Childrenâs Rights, told me, âWeâll have to do a line-by-line comparison between the new regulations and the proposed version from last September to decide how to direct our energy in the next seven days.â\n\nThe broader consequences of the Administrationâs rollback could extend well beyond detention conditions. When minors travel to the U.S. alone, for instance, theyâre categorized as unaccompanied, a designation that affords them additional rights such as the ability to apply for asylum through an asylum officer, as opposed to a judge in the more adversarial setting of an immigration court. âThis isnât just about being detained,â Podkul said. âItâs about the next two to three years an immigrant child spends going through the judicial system.â Earlier this summer, an official at H.H.S.âwho at the time suspected that the Presidentâs senior adviser, Stephen Miller, was behind an unprecedented push to reclassify unaccompanied childrenâtold me, âThe expectation is that the Administration will change the policy regarding the definition of an unaccompanied child.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A child arriving at the border alone will not be declared unaccompanied if they have a parent âavailableâ in the U.S. to care for them. That means the child will be subject to expedited removal.â The idea, the official added, was to skirt Congress by instituting the change in the form of a regulation, while creating yet another pretext for assailing lawmakers for their failure to take some radical action of their own. And that is exactly what has happened: the regulations announced this week will further whittle away the legal rights of immigrant children. âThe change will end up in court immediately,â the official had told me. But the Administration wanted to send a message anyway.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c9cb75f002c8941e4a9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Eyes closed, heâs standing in the barely lit home of a Haitian family, where he announces that in twenty-three months they will have electricity twenty-four hours a dayâeven as the father reads a book by candle light and the mother presses clothes with a charcoal-fuelled iron. The couple more or less ignores him while only their baby cheers him on.\n\nIn the accompanying article by the journalist Roberson Alphonse, published in Haitiâs *Le Nouvelliste* newspaper, on August 10, 2017, MoÃ¯se is quoted as saying, âWhen I say the entire country will have electricity twenty-four hours a day in twenty-three months, I will do it.â He added that a President âshouldnât have to promise that. Itâs an obligation, a necessity. A country must have electricity, water, and roads.â\n\nItâs been thirty-two months since MoÃ¯se was sworn into office after a contested, fraud-plagued, two-round [election cycle](http://haitielection2015.blogspot.com) in which only eighteen per cent of eligible voters participated. In a country of more than ten million people, about six hundred thousand voted for him. Even before taking his Presidential oath, MoÃ¯se was accused by Haitiâs Central Financial Intelligence Unit (*UCREF*{: .small}) of having [laundered](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article128501399.html) millions of dollars. A few months into his term, he [fired](http://www.lenouvelliste.com/article/171039/ucref-sans-directeur-general-des-organismes-de-defense-des-droits-humains-preoccupes-par-la-decision-de-lexecutif) the director of *UCREF*{: .small}âa move that probably led to MoÃ¯se being [cleared](http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Judge_clears_Haiti_President_Moise_in_money_laundering_probe) of the laundering charges, which he has denied.\n\nUnknown to most Haitians until he was handpicked by his predecessor, [Michel Martelly](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/sweet-micky-and-the-sad-deja-vu-of-haitis-presidential-elections)âwho also came to power through elections mired in fraudâMoÃ¯se was presented as a successful rural businessman from outside Haitiâs political class, a banana exporter nicknamed NÃ¨g Bannann, or Banana Man. Less advertised was that he was also an auto-parts dealer and a supposed road-construction magnate. According to two [reports published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1woCHbhEcIyQfuT1nsQgavfl8XPC5fB71/view) earlier this year by Haitiâs Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Disputes, in 2014, before heâd officially become a Presidential candidate, MoÃ¯se received more than a million dollars from Martellyâs government, funds that were allocated for road construction and repair in the northern region of the country. The government auditors report that MoÃ¯se was paid twice for the same contract, once as the head of Agritrans and again as the leader of another firm, called Betexs. The two firms were listed as having the same staff and projects, as well as the same government patent and tax-identification number. The [road](https://canada-haiti.ca/content/president-moises-companies-embezzled-millions-petrocaribe-funds-court-finds) for which the money was doubly paid shows no sign of having been constructed or repaired. MoÃ¯se also got more than a hundred thousand dollars for another one of his companies, Comphener S.A., to install solar panels on street lamps.\n\nThe funds allegedly pilfered in these schemes came from Venezuelaâs [Petrocaribe oil program](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article184740783.html), which Haiti joined in 2006. Through the Petrocaribe agreement, the Haitian government bought oil from Venezuela, paid sixty per cent of the purchase price within ninety days, then deferred the rest of the debt, at a one-per-cent interest rate, over twenty-five years. The Haitian government controlled the sale of the oil and was supposed to use those funds for development projects, including infrastructure, agriculture, education, sanitation, and health. This debt to Venezuela has grown to almost two billion dollars over the past decade.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d9f8bd525b96f00088b48fa]||||||\n+++\n\n\nOn July 6, 2018, MoÃ¯seâs government announced that it was raising the price of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene between thirty-eight and fifty-one per cent, in order to qualify for low-interest loans from the International Monetary Fund. Huge nationwide demonstrations followed. [I was in Haiti at the time](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/haitians-want-to-know-what-the-government-has-done-with-missing-oil-money), and it was clear that most Haitians were fed up with all the corruption, as well as MoÃ¯seâs ineptitude at addressing the countryâs urgent problems. His [silence](https://www.france24.com/en/20190214-haiti-popular-unrest-turmoil-protests-stronger-death-toll-reaches-7-people-corruption) and [disappearance](https://lenouvelliste.com/article/207468/ou-est-passe-le-president-jovenel-moise) during difficult times has not worked in his favor, either.\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Haiti was already facing high rates of unemployment, rising inflation, a growing budget deficit, currency devaluation, and spikes in gang violence, all of which have grown considerably worse in the past year. MoÃ¯seâs government reversed its decision on the gas hike after twenty-four hours, but the protests continued. They were later amplified by the [Petrochallengers](https://www.wnyc.org/story/meet-the-petrochallengers-a-new-generation-wants-to-bring-accountability-to-haiti-can-they-succeed/), mostly young Haitians who started demanding accountability for the Petrocaribe funds, on the streets, and online.\n\nOn November 13, 2018, seventy-three men, women, and children were wounded, tortured, hacked with machetes, and set on fire in La Saline, an impoverished neighborhood of Port-au-Prince where residents had participated in Petrocaribe protests. Among them, fifty-nine were reportedly killed. Seven women were raped, and many houses were ransacked or burned, according to [the RÃ©seau National de DÃ©fense des Droits Humains](http://rnddh.org/content/uploads/2018/12/10-Rap-La-Saline-1Dec2018-Ang1.pdf). Witnesses accused two top government officials close to MoÃ¯se, Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan and Fednel MonchÃ©ry, of having been among those who helped to plan the La Saline massacre and providing area gang members with weapons and police uniforms. Both men, who have denied the allegations, remained in the government's employâMonchÃ©ry as the executive director of the interior ministry, and Duplan as MoÃ¯seâs representative for La Saline and the surrounding areaâuntil a few weeks ago, when they were [fired](https://lenouvelliste.com/article/207331/fednel-monchery-et-joseph-pierre-richard-duplan-revoques) by MoÃ¯se as the protests intensified. MoÃ¯se has not directly denounced the La Saline massacre, nor has his government sought to prosecute any of the perpetrators. The government has also not provided any medical, financial, or security support to the survivors. The killings in La Saline reminded Haitiansâespecially those living in destitute, gang-controlled areasâwhat can happen when people in power want their resistance smashed.\n\nIn February, 2019, the frequency and size of the protests grew, starting on the second anniversary of MoÃ¯seâs inauguration and the [thirty-third anniversary](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article225931055.html) of the end of the thirty-year Duvalier dictatorship. Schools and businesses were closed for ten days and public transportation was generally halted in what became known as *peyi lÃ²k*, or [Operation Lockdown](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2019/02/19/after-10-days-protest-haiti-steps-back-brink). During *peyi lÃ²k,* thirty-four people were reported to have [died](https://reliefweb.int/report/haiti/united-nations-mission-justice-support-haiti-report-secretary-general-s2019198) and a hundred and two injured. Venezuela, which is dealing with its own political and economic crisis, is no longer providing discounted fuel to Haiti, so the Haitian government now buys fuel from U.S.-based energy traders, to whom the government has been chronically [in arrears](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-fuel/dispute-with-u-s-energy-trader-worsens-haitis-fuel-crisis-idUSKCN1RQ0MD). This led to recurring blackouts and gas shortages this past summer. \n\n*Peyi lÃ²k* returned in full force in September, in the midst of a widespread fuel shortage. Haiti has now been on lockdown for a month, with large demonstrations taking place almost every day. Schools have not been opened. The sick canât get to hospitals, where resources are also dwindling. Those who are not at the demonstrations lock themselves up at home until thereâs a reprieve, during which they go out and buy food, which has become exorbitantly expensive, and water, of which there is a shortage in some areas. Haitians from all walks of life have been calling for MoÃ¯seâs resignation, including Catholic and Protestant clergy, artists and intellectuals, university professors, business people, bar associations, and the various groups and parties that make up the political opposition.\n\nMoÃ¯se has repeatedly said he will [not resign](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article235443547.html). In his most [recent](https://www.voanews.com/americas/haitis-president-delivers-national-address-seeking-calm-furious-nation) pre-recorded [address](https://www.facebook.com/187924271334343/posts/2255034161290000?sfns=mo)âreleased on September 25th, at 2 *A.M.*{: .small}âhe told Haitians that heâs heard their cries and is aware of their despair. He called for unity and dialogue. He promised not to respond to violence with violence. The streets, where some police officers have used [live ammunition](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/haiti-police-tear-gas-live-ammunition-protesters-190928000101679.html) to disperse protesters, tell a different story. The senator from MoÃ¯seâs party [who fired a pistol](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-politics-image/pistol-packing-senators-confront-haitis-angry-opposition-idUSKBN1W92US) outside the parliament building last month, wounding a photojournalist and security guard, also tells another story. As does the [massacre in La Saline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrCYa91XHE4).\n\nLooking back at that 2017 cartoon of MoÃ¯se being derided as a would-be superhero, I am reminded that it is the Haitian people who have always exhibited superhuman traits and who have had to continue to do so over the past year. They have been dodging bullets and enduring tear gas and water cannons while, for the most part, not being able to eat regularly, or send their children to school, or go to a decent hospital when they are sick, or afford the medicine they need. I know from speaking with many young people in my own family and beyond that they know MoÃ¯se is just the latest manifestation of bigger and broader structural and institutional problems. They are also aware that, like generations of Haitians before them, they are fighting for a very uncertain future.\n\nThe [young men](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article225955825.html) and [women](https://youtu.be/-Go4QcnhH5Q) demonstrators, when speaking to both local and foreign journalists, sometimes speak of their desire for a [tabula rasa](https://www.scribd.com/article/400013309/Haiti-s-Current-Political-Unrest-Deja-Vu-Or-Opportunity-For-Meaningful-Change). They want a more egalitarian, inclusive, and just society, where the rights of every citizen will be respected. Not just the wealthy and well-connected but the urban and rural poor, too. They want the international community to stop [meddling](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article235807497.html) and pushing elections as a vehicle for change, only to [rig them](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/7/15/usaid-funded-group-supporting-haitian-president.html) and saddle the country with leaders like Martelly and MoÃ¯se. They want [Haitian-led](https://lenouvelliste.com/article/207578/nou-pap-domi-cest-aux-haitiens-de-trouver-une-solution-a-la-crise) solutions. They want institutions that work. They want an end to impunity. They want freedom from government and privately funded gangs, who routinely [rape](https://youtu.be/-Go4QcnhH5Q) women and girls. They ultimately want accountability not just from MoÃ¯se but from everyone who has stolen or squandered the Petrocaribe money, which their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren will still have to repay.\n\nThey must see some parallels between themselves and those taking part in the equally massive, and increasingly violent, [protests in Hong Kong](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-disillusion-and-frustration-of-a-new-generation-is-fuelling-hong-kongs-protests), to which the world at least is paying attention. Twenty people were killed and about two hundred injured during the protests this past September. The numbers are likely to increase this month as demonstrations persist and ramp up in intensity. One thing that MoÃ¯se said in his dead-of-night speech on September 25th, which all Haitians should be able to agree on, is that â*Ayiti pap peri. Ayiti pa dwe peri*.â Haiti will not perish.

My husband and I and our two daughters visited my mother-in-law in a small town in the countryâs south, where we spent the long, scorching days showing our U.S.-born niece, who was in Haiti for the first time, the sights, and watching [World Cup](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/world-cup) soccer games in the back yard of a neighbor who happened to have a television and was charging people the equivalent of a quarter to watch each game.\n\nThe World Cup was an obsession in our area, as it was in the rest of Haiti, where the Brazilian team is a perennial favorite. There were Brazilian flags everywhereâon cars, motorcycles, and homesânot because Brazil had led *MINUSTAH*{:.small}, the multibillion-dollar, decade-long United Nations peacekeeping [debacle](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-new-chapter-for-the-disastrous-united-nations-mission-in-haiti) in Haiti, or because thousands of Haitians had [migrated](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article103920161.html) to Brazil during the past decade, but because most Haitians claim Brazilâs soccer team as [their own](https://africasacountry.com/2018/07/brazil-is-in-many-ways-haitis-national-side) and were hoping that the team would win its sixth World Cup in the last sixty years. \n\nAlas, it was not to be. On July 6th, we drove to the home of a family friend in Port Salut, a beautiful coastal town about thirty miles from where we were staying, to watch Brazil face Belgium in the quarter-finals. So many of our friendâs neighbors had come to watch the game that he pitched a makeshift tent in front of his house to accommodate us all. When the match ended and Brazil [lost](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2018/07/06/brazil-vs-belgium-2018-world-cup-quarterfinal/), scoring only one goal to Belgiumâs two, the young woman sitting next to me began sobbing. I thought she was a superfan who was overcome with grief at the loss, but as she rocked herself she said, âWhat am I going to do with all the merchandise?â Sheâd been hoping that the Brazilian team would make it to the finals, she said, and had got a high-interest loan to buy Brazil jerseys, flags, and bracelets to sell. Now the items would be practically worthless, and she was deep in debt. Her anguish was a reminder that the fate of some of the poorest people in Haiti is linked to factors far beyond their control.\n\nPort Salut felt like a graveyard when we left it that evening, and not just because of the disappointment over the World Cup. During Brazilâs final match, the Haitian government had announced that, in order to insure that the country would qualify for low-interest loans from the [International Monetary Fund](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214722915.html), it was substantially [raising the price](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214594110.html) of gasoline and diesel. Even the price of kerosene, which was used to light most homes in the Haitian countryside, was going up by fifty-one per cent.\n\nWe only heard the news on the drive back to my mother-in-lawâs, when we began receiving messages from family members and friends advising us to get off the roads to avoid running into roadblocks that had been erected in protest. We encountered nearly a dozen on the way, most of them made from piles of rocks and flaming tires and being guarded by anxious young men. At a back-road riverbedâa last-resort detourâa young moto-taxi-driver, explaining why he and his friends would not let us through, detailed how the sudden gas hike would chip away at the life they were struggling to build for themselves and their families. âWe want a future, but they keep snatching it away,â he said.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, the government announced that it was [reversing](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article214497129.html) its decision on the gas hike. Days of nationwide protests followed nonetheless. Haitiâs President, Jovenel MoÃ¯se, made sometimes scolding and sometimes pleading speeches on television. His Prime Minister resigned. A [new government](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article218493170.html) was formed. But a lingering flame of anger remained. Or, at least, rekindled.\n\nIn October of 2017, a Haitian Senate [report](https://www.miamiherald.com/article184740783.html) detailed how, between 2008 and 2016, funds that had been accumulated through Haitiâs participation in Venezuelaâs oil-purchasing program, [Petrocaribe](https://www.as-coa.org/articles/explainer-what-petrocaribe), were misused, misappropriated, or embezzled by government officials and their cronies in the private sector. The Petrocaribe agreement, which Haiti signed in 2006, allowed the Haitian government to buy oil from Venezuela, pay sixty per cent of the purchase price within ninety days, and then defer the rest of the debt, at a one-per-cent interest rate, over twenty-five years. This debt has grown to almost two billion dollars over the past decade. The Haitian government controlled the sale of the oil and was supposed to use those funds for social and development projects, including sanitation and health, at a time when ten thousand Haitians had been killed and nearly a million had been affected by a [cholera epidemic](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/world/americas/united-nations-haiti-cholera.html) that was introduced by the United Nations. The funds were also supposed to be used to build infrastructure and grow the agricultural sectorâthe supposed [specialty](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article117626878.html) of MoÃ¯se, who had nicknamed himself NÃ¨g Bannann, or Banana Man, during his Presidential campaign. The funds could have been used, too, for education, one of the stated [priorities](https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-struggles-to-begin-free-public-education-133018688/164638.html) of MoÃ¯seâs predecessor, [Michel Martelly](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/sweet-micky-and-the-sad-deja-vu-of-haitis-presidential-elections),  whose government added a [dollar-and-fifty-cent surcharge](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/haiti-new-tax-money-relatives-sparks-outrage-brooklyn-community-article-1.156354) on each money transfer to Haiti from abroad to finance free and universal education. (These funds, totalling millions of dollars a year, remain mostly [unaccounted for](http://www.ijdh.org/2013/04/topics/education-topics/michel-martellys-education-plan-in-haiti-marked-by-mismanagement-and-inflated-claims/).)\n\nThe pilfering of the Petrocaribe funds has been a concern in Haiti for years, but it wasnât until this summer, when the writer and filmmaker Gilbert Mirambeau, Jr., [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GibszZZz/status/1029445853788991490) a photo showing himself blindfolded like a kidnapping victim, holding a handwritten cardboard sign reading âKot KÃ²b Petwo Karibe a???â (âWhere is the Petrocaribe money???â), that these grievances began spreading widely online. #KotKÃ²bPetwoKaribea became a popular hashtag, and other Haitians posted images of themselves inspired by Mirambeauâs. Anti-corruption street protests became larger and more frequent, culminating in [massive demonstrations](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article220144215.html) on Wednesday in cities in Haiti and in the diaspora. In Port-au-Prince, there were reports of two deaths and [clashes](https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-police-open-fire-on-protesters-/4617500.html) with police. \n\nI attended a march of around a hundred people in Miamiâs Little Haiti neighborhood, where, between chants of âWhereâs the money?â and âCatch the thieves,â the protest leaders were already talking about their next outing, on November 18th. That date will mark the two hundred and fifteenth anniversary of the Battle of VertiÃ¨res, the last major conflict fought before Haiti won its independence from France, under the leadership of, among others, the Haitian founding father Jean-Jacques Dessalines, whose death was also being remembered on Wednesday.\n\nIn a commemorative [speech](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-petrocaribe/at-least-one-dead-dozens-hurt-as-thousands-protest-graft-in-haiti-idUSKCN1MR37S) delivered near the site where Dessalines was assassinated, MoÃ¯se made empty promises about fighting corruption at the highest levels of power. But it seems highly unlikely that his government will perform a satisfactory investigation into the missing Petrocaribe fundsâa probe that could implicate himself, his predecessor, and their friends and colleagues. It seems equally unlikely that Haitians will stop asking, on social media and in the streets, âKot kÃ²b Petrocaribe a?âââWhereâs the Petrocaribe money?â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d2c2bc86f2c9a244a4a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Haiti","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"haiti"},{"id":"5c2e1d4fee7fe02cbd1633fa","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Petrocaribe","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"petrocaribe"},{"id":"5c2e1cb87e716b454591adff","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Miami","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"miami"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b397f5b30646d0607","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Corruption","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"corruption"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00e2c14b3c606c109ee7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/edwidge-danticat","email":"","name":"Edwidge Danticat","socialMedia":[],"title":"Edwidge Danticat is the author of many books, including, most recently, â[Everything Inside: Stories](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Inside-Stories-Edwidge-Danticat/dp/0525521275).â"}]},"dek":"","hed":"Haitians Want to Know What the Government Has Done with Missing Oil Money","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-10-19T20:49:46.907Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5bca29d375aaf6710e468c12","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:2":{"width":656,"height":656,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":906,"y":590,"height":656,"width":656}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":198,"height":1440,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2275,"height":1706,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":62,"y":0,"height":1706,"width":2275}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1655,"height":1655,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":551,"y":51,"height":1655,"width":1655}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2018/10/19/5bca29d375aaf6710e468c11_Edwidge-HaitiProtests.jpg","width":2560,"height":1707,"duration":null}},"caption":"A protest over missing Petrocaribe funds in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in August.

I was four years old and she was leaving Haiti for the United States to join my father, whoâd emigrated two years earlier, to escape both a dictatorship and poverty. My mother was entrusting my younger brother and me to the care of my uncle and his wife, who would look after us until our parents could establish permanent residencyâthey had both travelled on tourist visasâin the United States.\n\nOn the day my mother left, I wrapped my arms around her legs before she headed for the plane. She leaned down and tearfully unballed my fists so that my uncle could peel me off her. As my brother dropped to the floor, bawling, my mother hurried away, her tear-soaked face buried in her hands. She couldnât bear to look back. We would not see her again for three years.\n\nSome may assume that certain immigrant parents, because they leave their children behind, or send them alone on possibly perilous journeys, donât love their children as much as, say, parents whose parental love is never tested in this way. When I was a teen-ager, I asked my parents about their immigration choices. If the lives of my brother and me had been in danger, or if theyâd had no one to leave us with, they certainly would have taken us with them, they said. Though they would have never been granted visas if they hadnât left us behind to prove that they had a reason to return.\n\nEven the type of carefully planned separation that my parents chose tore their hearts out. Whenever they were eating, my mother used to say, they wondered whether my brother and I were eating, too. When they went to bed at night, they wondered if my brother and I were sleeping. Even though we spoke to them on a scheduled call once a week, they never stopped worrying and longing for us.\n\nIt is perhaps that ache and longing that made my parents take me to visit Haitian refugees and asylum seekers who were being held at a detention center near the  Brooklyn Navy Yard when our family was reunited in New York, in the early nineteen-eighties. Back then, Rudolph Giuliani was the Associate Attorney General of the United States and the most vocal [opponent](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/04/03/world/around-the-world-us-official-finds-no-repression-in-haiti.html) of parole for twenty-one hundred Haitian refugees being held at different detention facilities around the U.S. After travelling to Haiti and speaking to Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier, the dictator whom these migrants had fled, Giuliani concluded that the Haitians had nothing to fear and should be deported.\n\nIâve continued to visit detention facilities over the years, including ones where children are held, either alone or with their parents. It is not easy to enter such places. At many facilities, one can get only a curated view, either alongside a group of journalists or by attaching oneself to a congressional delegation. At a childrenâs facility in Cutler Bay, Florida, which I used to visit with a registered volunteer, most boys and girls were waiting to be reunited with a parent or relative already living in the United States. Many of these young people had experienced such horrible trauma during their long journey from Central America to the U.S. border with Mexico that they could barely focus on the activities the volunteers prepared for them, which included gardening and crafts. Some had been detained for so long that theyâd transitioned from childhood to adolescence behind those walls. Then there were [the Miami hotels](https://www.thenation.com/article/not-your-homeland/) turned detention centers that immigration lawyers and advocate friends would allow me to accompany them to, places where women and children were being held for weeks or months at a time. Up to six women spent twenty-four hours a day in one room, often with crying babies and toddlers, while armed guards patrolled the halls.\n\nOne of the most distressing aspects of immigration detention, for both adults and children, is how invisible the detained can become, even when theyâre imprisoned in our proverbial back yards. Had the world not seen the [images of children](https://apnews.com/6e04c6ee01dd46669eddba9d3333f6d5) wrapped in Mylar blankets and sleeping inside cages, and heard babies and toddlers [crying](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-cruelty-and-the-crying-children) for their parents, both as a result of the Trump Administrationâs âzero-toleranceâ policy, some might not have believed that these children had been yanked from their parentsâ armsâone, reportedly, while [being breast-fed](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/06/14/undocumented-mother-baby-taken-while-breastfeeding-lavandera-newday.cnn). Even in the light of clear and horrifying evidence, many would rather hold fast to their willful denial, branding the cages sets, the detained children [actors](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/06/18/migrant-kids-are-child-actors-ann-coulter-says-on-fox-news-telling-trump-not-to-be-fooled/?utm_term=.7987861106c1), and the detention facilities the equivalent of [boarding schools and summer camps](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/06/19/fox-news-laura-ingraham-says-immigrant-child-detention-centers-are-essentially-summer-camps/?utm_term=.026ffa1b502d).\n\nIn May, an A.C.L.U. [report](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-obtains-documents-showing-widespread-abuse-child-immigrants-us-custody) produced from thirty thousand pages of official documents, dated  between 2009 and 2014, detailed incidents of U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers verbally, physically, and sexually abusing migrant children. The cases cited include accounts of children being Tased, punched, kicked in the head and ribs. Young migrants complained of being denied food and water and medical care, of being strip-searched and threatened with rape and murder while confined to freezing and unsanitary rooms. Teen-agers detained at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, in Virginia, testified in court filings that they were [handcuffed to chairs with bags over their heads and were left naked in cold concrete cells](http://time.com/5318165/juvenile-immigrants-virginia-detention-abuse-shenandoah/). Others, detained elsewhere, have reported being thrown on the ground in order to be [force-fed or injected with psychotropic drugs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/us/undocumented-migrant-children-detention-facilities-abuse-invs/index.html). U.S. Customs and Border Protection has either [dismissed or denied](https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/speeches-and-statements/cbp-s-response-unfounded-aclu-report) these charges.\n\nThis is what may await many of the children who have already been separated from their parents under the current Administrationâs zero-tolerance policy. (The Department of Homeland Security has said that, out of the twenty-three hundred separated children, five hundred and twenty-two [have been reunited](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/migrant-children-reunited.html) with their parents.) The [executive order that Trump passed last week](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-border-crisis-following-trumps-executive-order) to end family separation makes no provisions for the children who are still separated from their parents.\n\nSome of these children have already arrived in Florida, where I live. Last Saturday, a social-worker friend and I drove around the fenced perimeters of one of those facilities, the His House Childrenâs Home, in Miami Gardens, which, according to [the Miami *Herald*](http://www.miamiherald.com/article213729394.html), is currently housing ten children ranging from ânewborns to 5 year olds.â Made up of a series of yellow and beige buildings, some of which are boarded up, His House Childrenâs Home has been linked to the death of at least one child, who [suffocated](http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/miami-child-migrant-facility-accused-of-letting-child-suffocate-10460856) under a blanket, in 2007\\. His House has also been accused, by some of the U.S.-born children who have been placed in foster care there, of treating them like [prisoners](http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article211177094.html). His House staff has denied that children are mistreated there. My friend works in the state foster system, and said that places like His House are a last resort for the children in her care. âHere we are trying to do all we can to keep children with their parents, and our country is separating other children from theirs,â she said.\n\nJennifer Anzardo Valdes, the program director of the Childrenâs Legal Program at the Florida-based Americans for Immigrant Justice, has represented unaccompanied minors in the foster-care system and also those in immigration detention. Her team is now representing some of the children who have been taken from their parents at the border. Valdes and her team were aware of families being separated months before the [zero-tolerance policy was officially announced](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents), by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in April. One of their clients, Ana, a three-year-old girl from Guatemala, was separated from her father in July, 2017. Anaâs father came to the U.S. with her; her mother, who stayed behind, died shortly afterward. They were held together in a crowded facility for two days. Then Anaâs father was told that she was going to be looked after elsewhere. Nobody told him where she was being taken. He was told that they would return her to him when he was released. Before he was deported, in early December, 2017, he asked if he could take her with him. He has not seen her since. \n\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5b2d043f87016730a4fd0ea7]||||||\n\n+++\n\nAna was released into the custody of relatives in South Florida this past January. If not for Valdes and her team, and other immigration lawyers like them, many migrant children, like Ana, would have to find their ways through the immigration system alone. Valdes uses a coloring book, designed by her organization and illustrated by a local artist, to help small children like Ana make sense of the immigration process. One illustration in their âConozca sus Derechosâ (âKnow Your Rightsâ) brochure shows a smiling family of four holding hands. Another page shows a map of the United States, to help the children identify where they are. Another shows a Santa Claus-like judge with the words âLa Corteâ (âThe Courtâ) printed above his head. âIâm sure you can imagine the challenges we have trying to explain the court process to a three-year-old,â Valdes said.\n\n Itâs worth remembering that the Trump Administration has been finding ways to divide families from the very beginning. The so-called [Muslim ban](https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights/living-muslim-ban) kept U.S citizens and others from being reunited with their spouses and children from five Muslim-majority countries. The [dismantling](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/daca-hurricane-irma-and-young-americans-dreams-deferred) of the Obama-era executive order [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/daca), or *DACA*{:.small}, has left eight hundred thousand Dreamers, some of them heads of households, in personal and financial limbo. The revocation of [Temporary Protected Status](https://www.afsc.org/blogs/news-and-commentary/trump-has-ended-temporary-protected-status-hundreds-thousands-immigrants) for Haiti, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvadorâsome of the very places from which the current waves of migrants at the border are fleeingâcould lead to the deportation of more than three hundred thousand men and women, including some who have U.S.-born children, whom they may have no choice but to leave behind.\n\nWhen vulnerable populations are kept hidden, or are forced into hidingâwhich is the daily reality of so many of the undocumented in Trumpâs Americaâthey not only live in the shadows; they become slowly erased. At the moment, everyone seems to be paying attention. But these families and children, and others who find themselves in the crosshairs of this Administrationâs draconian immigration policies, will still need us to keep paying attention, even when the media coverage wanes and we are no longer seeing photographs of children in cages, or hearing recordings of their pleas and cries.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1d2c2bc86f2c9a244a4a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Haiti","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"haiti"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Crisis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-crisis"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1c9a81ab3335f580f1a7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Migrants","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"migrants"},{"id":"5c2e1c962396212cbb9fc9be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Children","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"children"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a00e2c14b3c606c109ee7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/edwidge-danticat","email":"","name":"Edwidge Danticat","socialMedia":[],"title":"Edwidge Danticat is the author of many books, including, most recently, â[Everything Inside: Stories](https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Inside-Stories-Edwidge-Danticat/dp/0525521275).â"}]},"dek":"","hed":"We Must Not Forget Detained Migrant Children","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-06-26T23:25:37.518Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"5b32971ea7c678272dfb82e8","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"2:2":{"width":929,"height":929,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":528,"y":626,"height":929,"width":929}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":2560,"height":1440,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":267,"height":1440,"width":2560}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":2276,"height":1707,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1707,"width":2276,"x":142,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":1423,"height":1423,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":475,"y":283,"height":1423,"width":1423}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2018/06/26/5b32971ea7c678272dfb82e7_Danticat-Family-Separation-Border.jpg","width":2560,"height":1707,"duration":null}},"caption":"When vulnerable populations are kept hiddenâwhich is the daily reality of so many of the undocumented in Trumpâs Americaâthey not only live in the shadows; they become slowly erased.

A look back over the coverage of the storyâa repeatedly discredited conspiracy theory involving Joe Biden and his son Hunterâs work in Ukraineâsuggests that Americaâs news organizations continue to be just as susceptible to manipulation by political partisans pushing complicated and hard-to-check foreign narratives as they were in 2016\\. In fact, several of the same players are involved. âThereâs no effective mechanism in this country for weeding disinformation out,â Paul Barrett, the deputy director of N.Y.U.âs Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, and the author of the recent study â[Disinformation and the 2020 Election](https://issuu.com/nyusterncenterforbusinessandhumanri/docs/nyu_election_2020_report),â said. âWeâre not doing anything about it at all.â \n\nAnyone trying to track the Ukrainian conspiracy stories that were eventually embraced by President Trump is likely to get mired in the same echo chamber of right-wing news purveyors that misinformed voters in 2016\\. A pivotal source of the allegations against the Bidens, for instance, is the Government Accountability Institute, a Florida-based opposition-research operation that was founded by the former Trump political adviser Stephen Bannonâthe same conservative nonprofit that ginned up questionable stories about the Clintons during the last Presidential campaign. In both instances, much of the coverage of the scandal was kicked off by Peter Schweizer, a longtime conservative political writer who is an editor-at-large at Breitbart News and the president of the Government Accountability Institute. Since its founding, in 2012, the group has largely been funded with millions of dollars in tax-exempt donations from the family foundation of the New York hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who was a major donor to Trumpâs 2016 campaign. In the organizationâs most recently available I.R.S. tax filings, for 2017, Mercerâs daughter Rebekah is listed as the board chairman.\t\n\nAsked about the Government Accountability Instituteâs role in this yearâs Biden scandal coverage, Bannon e-mailed to say, âItâs key. It was the predicate,â as it had been for much of the previous Clinton scandal coverage. As Joshua Green describes in â[Devilâs Bargain](https://www.amazon.com/Devils-Bargain-Bannon-Nationalist-Uprising-ebook/dp/B0728KHFD5),â his book, from 2017, about Bannonâs role in the Trump campaign, Bannon designed the organization as a means of transmitting partisan dirt-digging to the mainstream media. He realized that, though mainstream reporters were suspicious of partisan opinion, they were open to damning facts about public figures, regardless of the sourcing. He set out, with Schweizer, to produce material that would generate mainstream coverage, and right-wing outrage.\n\nThus, during the last Presidential campaign, under the auspices of the Government Accountability Institute, Schweizer published the best-selling book â[Clinton Cash](https://www.amazon.com/Clinton-Cash-Foreign-Governments-Businesses/dp/0062369296).â In a novel arrangement, he doled out negative scoops about the Clintons from it in advance to a variety of mainstream news outlets, including the *Times*. The paper disclosed its arrangement with the bookâs author to its readers, and maintained that it independently verified and expanded on the information. But when it ran a front-page [story](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html) derived from the book on April 24, 2015, the *Times* stirred controversy and criticism, including from its own public editor.\n\nThe story insinuated that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton had risked national security by facilitating the sale of American uranium mines to Russia in exchange for more than two million dollars in contributions to the Clinton Foundation from the businessmen behind the deal, who worked for a company called Uranium One. The story enabled Clintonâs opponents to frame her as greedy and corrupt. Even a year after she had lost the race, the Fox News host Sean Hannity was still invoking it on air, calling it âthe biggest scandal ever involving Russia.â \n\nYet [later](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house) reporting poked holes in the storyâs insinuation of corruption, and argued that the amount of uranium involved was insignificant. (Schweizer didnât respond to phone calls from *The New Yorker*.) On Thursday, the Daily Beast [identified](https://www.thedailybeast.com/peter-schweizer-book-alleging-biden-corruption-in-ukraine-appears-to-have-lifted-passages-from-wikipedia) what it said were over a dozen passages in his book, â[Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends](https://www.amazon.com/Secret-Empires-American-Political-Corruption/dp/0062569368),â that were lifted from other sources, such as Wikipediaâa charge that his publisher, HarperCollins, denied amounted to a violation of fair use. \n\nFor those who recall the âClinton Cashâ controversy, the baseless tales claiming that Biden corruptly intervened on behalf of his sonâs Ukrainian business interests feel a lot like the movie âGroundhog Day.â In March of 2018, Schweizer and the Government Accountability Institute once again produced a book that was perfectly timed for the Presidential campaign. âSecret Empiresâ devoted a chapter to the subject of âBidens in Ukraine,â which laid out the conflicts of interest posed by the wheeling and dealing of Bidenâs son Hunter. (An additional chapter laid out Hunter Bidenâs business deals in China.) As the book recounted, in 2014, Hunter Biden, a Washington lobbyist, took a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch, while his father, who was then the Vice-President, handled a drive to rid Ukraine of corruption. Other news organizations, including the *Times* and the *Wall Street* *Journal,* had already run stories on the same unethical-seeming morass. (In July, *The New Yorker* published a piece about the relationship between Joe and [Hunter Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign) that dismissed allegations of any illegality in the Ukraine matter but included some concerns from Obama Administration officials that Hunter could potentially undermine his fatherâs work.) \n\nBut Schweizer went a step further. His chapter implied not just that Burisma was a crooked company but that the end of a Ukrainian criminal investigation into it on January 12, 2017, was in some unstated way connected to Joe Bidenâs visit to the country four days later. In this way, Schweizer floated the possibility that, as Vice-President, Biden had abused his power to protect the company or his son from prosecution. Yet Schweizer provided no proof of causation nor evidence of illegality.\n\nAs he rolled out his new book, Schweizer promoted it in all the usual conservative news outlets, including âHannityâ andÂ âThe Story with Martha MacCallum,â on Fox News. But the turning point in the Biden coverage, it appears, was in late 2018, when Trumpâs private lawyer and political advocate, the former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, got involved. That winter, Giuliani began speaking to current and former Ukrainian officials about the Biden conspiracy theory, and meeting with them repeatedly in New York and Europe. Among those officials was Viktor Shokin, a former top Ukrainian prosecutor who was sacked in March, 2016, after European and U.S. officials, including Joe Biden, complained that he was lax in curbing corruption. Shokin claimed that he had lost his powerful post not because of his poor performance but rather because Biden wanted to stop his investigation of Burisma, in order to protect his son. The facts didnât back this up. The Burisma investigation had been dormant under Shokin. But in March, according to [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/giuliani-says-state-dept-vowed-investigate-after-he-gave-ukraine-n1061931), Giuliani gave the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, a packet of Trump Hotel folders containing the purported evidence against Biden, including Giulianiâs interview with Shokin and his strategy to spread the Biden story, âincluding segments being placed on Fox News.â Before long, this explosive, politically useful legend took on a life of its own in Americaâs conservative media.\n\nAs an anonymous whistle-blowerâs complaint to Congress revealed, and as the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-a-conservative-columnist-helped-push-a-flawed-ukraine-narrative/2019/09/26/1654026e-dee7-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html) has reported, no journalist played a bigger part in fuelling the Biden corruption narrative than John Solomon, who until last week was an opinion columnist and executive vice-president of *The Hill*, in Washington. Solomon had been a respected investigative reporter for the Washington *Post*, but in recent years he worked for overtly conservative outlets, including a stint as the editor of the Washington *Times*. As Giuliani conspired this past spring with questionable Ukrainian sources, Solomon pumped out a string of eye-catching stories echoing those sourcesâ claims about the Bidens. This appears to have been no coincidence. According to NBC, the Giuliani documents show that Solomonâs columns were part of the Trump teamâs strategy. (*The New Yorker* was unable to reach John Solomon, and a question e-mailed to the editor of *The Hill*, about whether the publication stood by Solomonâs stories, went unanswered.) \n\nThis spring, Solomon wrote a series of columns, based on an interview with Ukraineâs top prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko. On March 26th, Solomon [wrote a column](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/435906-us-embassy-pressed-ukraine-to-drop-probe-of-george-soros-group-during-2016) about Lutsenkoâs claim that the then U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, an Obama holdover named Marie Yovanovitch, had given him a list of politically protected figures that he was forbidden from prosecutingâa charge the State Department dismissed as âan outright fabrication.â That same day, Solomon wrote another column suggesting a new investigation into Clinton, which he shared in a tweet, writing, âDid Ukraine try to secretly help Hillary Clinton win the 2016 election? Chief prosecutor says thereâs enough evidence to start investigating.â \n\nOn April 1st, Solomon turned his focus to Biden, writing a column for *The Hill* called âJoe Bidenâs 2020 Ukrainian Nightmare,â which [claimed](https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/436816-joe-bidens-2020-ukrainian-nightmare-a-closed-probe-is-revived) that Ukraine was reopening its criminal probe into Burisma. It also repeated the unsubstantiated claim that Shokinâs investigation into the company had been cut short at the behest of Biden. \n\nIn Solomonâs April 1st column, he cited Schweizerâs book. Two days later, Schweizer sent âkudosâ to Solomon during an interview on Breitbart News, and added, âWeâre talking about potentially legal jeopardy involving the Vice-Presidentâs family.â Schweizer opined that it was âall the sort of thing that needs to be investigated and looked into by a grand jury,â and added, âitâs pretty clear that you have a pattern that the for-sale sign was open with the Biden family&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that in itself demands investigation in the United States.â \n\nSoon, both Schweizer and Solomon were appearing repeatedly on Fox News, spreading the anti-Biden narrative further. According to the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, during the month of April, Fox ran at least twelve segments about Solomonâs reporting on Biden. After one of seven episodes in which Sean Hannity discussed it on his show, [President Trump tweeted a reference](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108559080204001280) to Solomonâs reporting. His son Donald Trump, Jr., took up the narrative, too, and [tweeted a link to a story](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1109850575926108161) in the Daily Wire, a conservative outlet, which echoed Solomonâs claims.\n\nOn April 7th, Giuliani appeared on Fox and demanded that the Justice Department investigate the Democratsâ Ukraine dealings. On April 25th, the same day that Joe Biden officially declared that he was running for President, Trump himself called in to Hannityâs show on Fox, [saying](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-barr-will-look-at-incredible-possibility-of-ukraine-clinton-collusion) that he wanted the Attorney General, Bill Barr, to be involved. By raising the spectre of a criminal investigation, Trump, a President dogged by allegations of corruption had, with the help of the conservative echo chamber, managed to cast his chief political rival in a parallel story, leaving the public in a fog of suspicion and confusion. As Barrett, of N.Y.U., explained it, âThe consequence is that we begin to inch our way towards the mire that Russians are in where ordinary people lose their ability to tell truth from untruth, and even cease caring about it.â\n\nBy May, the mainstream media, including the *[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html)*, had picked up on the story about Biden and Ukraine. Although the *Timesâ* piece ran under a headline pointing out that the scandal was being âpromoted by Trump and Allies,â and, midway, noted that there was no evidence of criminality, critics attacked the paper for reprising the Uranium One playbook. âItâs precisely what we saw in the last election,â Yochai Benkler, a professor at Harvard Law School and the co-author of the recent book â[Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics](https://www.amazon.com/Network-Propaganda-Manipulation-Disinformation-Radicalization/dp/0190923636),â told me. Benkler argues that when a publication with the *Timesâ* credibility pays any attention to a fringe conspiracy theory, it âprovides enormous validationâ just by covering the story. âI donât fault the *Times* for doing a story,â he said. âBut itâs not like the nineteen-sixties anymore, when there were just three TV networks. You live in a country where a large part of the population is susceptible to propaganda. Thereâs a new editorial responsibility to be much more careful and not bury the denial.â\n\nBy mid-summer, the *Times* and other mainstream outlets, most notably [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-07/timeline-in-ukraine-probe-casts-doubt-on-giuliani-s-biden-claim), had more or less knocked down the conspiracy theories. By then, Trump was so invested in the counterfactual narrative that he was demanding that Ukraineâs new President provide confirmation of it, as the whistle-blowerâs complaint relates. Or, as documents released by Congress earlier this week revealing discussions between his emissaries to Ukraine put it, âPotus really wants the deliverable.â With Trump facing the prospect of impeachment in the House of Representatives, it appears that he is a [casualty of his sideâs own disinformation](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-disinformation-reaches-donald-trump). âWhether Trump and Giuliani are dupes of their own propaganda I canât say. But the timeline is completely consistent with that,â Benkler said. âEither way, it proves that running an Administration based on Hannity is dangerous.â\n\n*A previous version of this piece mischaracterized the New York Timesâ engagement with Peter Schweizer, and one element of its reporting on Uranium One.*\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hunter

After telling Zelensky that âI would like you to do us a favor,â Trump said, âI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.â As the [whistle-blower complaint](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-whistle-blower-complaint-is-democracy-at-work-not-the-deep-state) explained, Trump was repeating a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had hacked the Democratic National Committeeâs servers, in 2016, perhaps with the assistance of CrowdStrike, an American cybersecurity firm that investigated the D.N.C. breach. âI do not know why the President associates these servers with Ukraine,â the whistle-blower wrote. (No credible evidence of such a conspiracy has emergedânor has an explanation for why Democrats would release private e-mails that damaged Hillary Clintonâs campaign and aided Trump.)\n\nOn Sunday, Tom Bossert, a former senior White House aide, told ABCâs âThis Weekâ that he had informed Trump that the theory was false, and blamed Trumpâs personal lawyer, [Rudolph Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), for [feeding it](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giuliani-is-a-one-man-wrecking-crew) to him. âI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing, and repeating that debunked theory to the President,â he said. âIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.â (Bossert later said, âIn fairness, I donât know that it was Rudy Giuliani that put that conspiracy theory into the Presidentâs head,â but âI know somebody did.â)\n\nBossertâs frustration echoes the concerns of several current and former Trump aides. All American Presidents are the focus of myriad disinformation campaigns designed to influence their thinking. Domestic political rivals use public statements and private flattery to attempt to sway the Presidentâs world view. Aides jostle to be seen as the most effective, resolute, and loyal lieutenant. But, under Trump, the amount of disinformation circulating in the White House has reached a new level, former Trump Administration officials told me. Trump is barraged with information from aides, political rivals, Fox News, and Twitter, much of it clearly designed to play to his long-held beliefs and biases. The former officials added that internecine battles among Trumpâs White House advisers sometimes exacerbate the amount of faulty information being presented to the President.\n\nSome aides also genuinely believe the conspiracy theories. This summer, a senior intelligence official [told me](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-message-to-us-intelligence-officials-be-loyal-or-leave) that Trumpâs Attorney General, [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-barr), is convinced that there is something nefarious in how the F.B.I. started its investigation, in 2016, of possible ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials. This spring, Trump authorized Barr to carry out sweeping reviews of the investigationâs origins and of an Intelligence Community assessment that found that Russia intervened in 2016 to benefit Trump. In May, Barr appointed the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the review, but Trump and Barr have contributed to the investigation. This week, Justice Department officials confirmed that Barr had asked Trump to [personally request](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/trump-australia-barr-mueller.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur) that the leader of Australia aid Barrâs inquiry, and also that Barr and Durham travelled to Italy last week to ask intelligence officials there to assist the probe. Former Justice Department officials expressed surprise about Barrâs involvement. A senior intelligence official called the claims of an international plotâsuch as the Obama Administration asking British intelligence to surveil Trump Towerââpreposterous.â The official pointed out that the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has already investigated the origins of the F.B.I.âs Trump-Russia investigation and found no wrongdoing.\n\nSome former Trump Administration officials agreed that the President and some of his aides trafficked in conspiracy theories, but they also defended his policies. Although they recognized his personal flaws, they expressed support of his efforts to confront China, to force American allies to pay more for their own defense, and to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into another war in the Middle East. When presented with good information, they contended, the President makes good decisions. Others said that they had lost faith in the President and his policies after observing his decision-making. A former senior national-security official told me that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both did a better job of weighing information. âThatâs why the President gets the big bucks,â he told me. âTo discern where the preponderance of the evidence lies, to discern where the more persuasive argument lies.â\n\nThe former national-security official noted that disinformation had complicated Trumpâs decision-making regarding policy in Afghanistan, in 2017\\. Some aides were telling Trump that he should adopt a proposal from Erik Prince, the brother of the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, to use private contractors rather than American soldiers to secure Afghanistan. The official said that the option was presented in an appealing but unrealistic way. âAn American company will do this cheaper and better without young Americans in uniform dying,â he said, paraphrasing the argument made by backers of the plan. Trump was also told that China was making large amounts of money in Afghanistan, while the U.S. provided the countryâs security, which played to Trumpâs sense that America was being taken advantage of by the Chinese. In fact, both claims were highly misleading. Guards from Princeâs former private-security company, Blackwater, had been convicted of killing more than a dozen civilians in a 2007 shooting in Baghdad; deploying a large number of Blackwater-like security contractors likely would have fuelled a surge in anti-American sentiment among Afghans and aided the Taliban insurgency. The scale of Chinese profits was exaggerated. American defense contracts had, in fact, made far larger profits in Afghanistan than had Chinese firms. In the end, the proposal to use private contractors was rejected, and Trump kept thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nLast year, conspiracy theories from outside the White House nearly derailed the passage of a major piece of legislation. On January 10, 2018, the White House issued a statement supporting the renewal of Section 702 of the *FISA*{: .small} Amendments Act, a post-9/11 program that allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect the communications of foreigners overseas without a warrantâincluding when they are speaking with Americans. The next morning, on âFox & Friends,â Andrew Napolitano, the networkâs top judicial analyst, directly appealed to Trump to change his position on the bill. âMr. President, this is not the way to go,â Napolitano [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/president-donald-trump-fisa/index.html). âSpying is valid to find the foreign agents among us. But itâs got to be based on suspicion and not an area code.â Napolitano went on to invoke the debunked conspiracy theory that British intelligence agencies had spied on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. Napolitano had first floated the theory a year earlier; it was [repeated](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39300191) by Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary. Stunned British intelligence officials, in a rare public rebuke, [dismissed the claim](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39300191) as ânonsenseâ and âutterly ridiculous.â The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee also investigated the claim and found it to be false.\n\nForty-five minutes after Napolitano asked Trump to oppose the law, the President [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951431836030459905), âThis is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?â Fearing that the legislation would fail to pass without Trumpâs support, aides convened an Oval Office meeting. John Kelly, then the White House chief of staff; H. R. McMaster, then the national-security adviser; Dan Coats, then the director of National Intelligence; Mike Pompeo, then the C.I.A. director; and Paul Ryan, then the Speaker of the House, who joined by phone, convinced Trump to reverse his reversal. âTodayâs vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,â [he tweeted](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/12/577744924/spy-bosses-helped-trump-draft-tweet-backing-surveillance-program). âWe need it! Get smart!â\n\nFormer officials said that they came to the conclusion that the character flaws they saw while working for Trump prevent the President from delivering on his agenda. They said that the President makes false statements, distrusts his own staff at times, and looks to outsiders for guidance. Now the pursuit of a conspiracy theory could lead to Trumpâs impeachment. Under attack, Trump is defending himself in the way he knows howâby claiming that the whistle-blower complaint is itself a conspiracy. On Wednesday, he said that he believed Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, âhelped writeâ the complaint, and dismissed it as a âscam.â Schiff flatly denied Trumpâs claims.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1d85b75f002c8941e59c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Disinformation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"disinformation"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

He has called the investigation a âcoupâ and the press âderanged.â He has demanded that his chief congressional antagonist, the California representative he demeans as âLiddleâ Adam Schiff,â be brought up on treason charges. He has attacked the âDo Nothing Democratsâ for wasting âeveryoneâs time and energy on *BULLSHIT*{:.small}.â \n\nThere have been so many rationales coming from the President that itâs been hard to keep them straight. âHow do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been, Cut Record Taxes & Regulations, fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years), & so much more,â he complained via tweet last week, in a less-than-accurate recap of his Administrationâs record. He called the charges against him a âhoaxâ and, quoting his lawyer [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giuliani-is-a-one-man-wrecking-crew), said that he was âframed by the Democrats.â He has blamed the â#Fakewhistleblowerâ and the âfake newsâ for the impeachment investigation, which has now replaced the [Mueller investigation](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation) in Trumpâs rhetoric as âthe Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our country.â Trump has also insisted, over and over again, that there was nothing at all wrong with his July 25th phone call with the President of Ukraine. The callâin which he [asked](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/do-us-a-favor-the-forty-eight-hours-that-sealed-trumps-impeachment) for the âfavorâ of having Ukraine investigate his 2020 political rival, the former Vice-President [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), even as he was holding up hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. military aidâtriggered the impeachment inquiry in the first place. But Trump says it was âperfect.â \n\nOn Thursday morning, Trump appeared to dispense with excuses altogether, no longer even bothering to contest the charge that he leaned on Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son [Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign). How do we know this? Because Trump did it again, live on camera, from the White House lawn. In a demand that is hard to interpret as anything other than a request to a foreign country to interfere in the U.S. election, Trump told reporters that Ukraine needs a âmajor investigationâ into the Bidens. âI would certainly recommend that of Ukraine,â the President added, shouting over the noise of his helicopter, as he prepared to board Marine One en route to Florida. He also volunteered, without being asked, that China âshould start an investigation into the Bidens,â too, given that Hunter Biden also had business dealings there while his father was in office. Trump, minutes after threatening an escalation in his [trade war](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/will-trump-back-down-as-his-trade-war-with-china-bites-the-us-economy) with China, suggested that he might even personally raise the matter of the Bidens with the Chinese leader, [Xi Jinping](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red). \n\nYou could practically hear the collective gasp in Washington. Republicans had spent days denying what Trump had more or less just admitted to. âAs President Trump keeps talking, he makes it more and more difficult for his supporters to mount an actual defense of his underlying behavior,â Philip Klein, the executive editor of the *Washington Examiner*, a conservative magazine, soon wrote. It was as though [Richard Nixon](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/how-watergate-set-the-stage-for-the-trump-impeachment-inquiry) in 1972 had gone out on the White House lawn and said, Yes, I authorized the Watergate break-in, and Iâd do it again. It was as though [Bill Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-bill-clinton-and-how-presidents-view-impeachment) in 1998 had said, Yes, I lied under oath about my affair with Monica Lewinsky, and Iâd do it again. \n\nTwitter wags immediately began wondering if the President had just committed the nationâs first act of self-impeachment. On CNN, a chyron read â*TRUMP ADMITS TO VERY OFFENSE DEMS LOOKING TO IMPEACH OVER*{: .small}.â His 2016 rival, [Hillary Clinton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/25/hillary-clinton-looks-back-in-anger), tweeted, âSomeone should inform the president that impeachable offenses committed on national television still count.â But that is not, of course, how Trump sees it. He now faces an energized Democratic majority in the House thatâs ready to impeach him for abusing his power. But with little prospect that the Republican Senate will dare to convict him and remove him from office, he isnât even bothering to deny the facts. Heâs saying, Yes, I did itâand so what? \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nSeveral weeks ago, back when Ukraine was an obscure Washington controversy about delayed military aid relegated to the inside pages of the *Times*, Trump already seemed to be a President on the verge of a nervous breakdown. His behavior, always erratic, had become noticeably more combative, angry, and extreme. He was hurling insults at a record pace, and he cancelled an August trip to Denmark in a fit of pique because its leader had mocked his offer to buy Greenland from her. [Looking at his tweets back then](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/trumps-wacky-angry-and-extreme-august-twitter), I found that Trump had amped up the volume to a striking degree, sending out hundreds more in August of this year than he had in previous summersâand many more of them were provocative, highly personal attacks on targets ranging from the âfake newsâ media to his Federal Reserve chairman.\n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nWell, we hadnât seen anything yet. Trump produced six hundred and ninety tweets in August; in September, he reached a record for his Presidency of eight hundred and one tweets, according to Factba.se, a company that tracks Trumpâs statements. There were whole new bizarre episodesâremember [Sharpiegate](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/sharpiegate-and-donald-trumps-perpetual-cone-of-uncertainty)? Trumpâs aborted Camp David invite to the [Taliban](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-stunt-with-the-taliban-was-not-about-negotiating-peace)?âand an angry parting of ways with [John Bolton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/trump-finally-fired-john-bolton-but-does-it-really-matter), his third national-security adviser. All of those incidents, of course, now seem as though they took place long ago. The sharpest spike in Trumpâs tweets, not surprisingly, came late in the month, when news of the Ukraine [whistle-blowerâs complaint](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-whistle-blower-complaint-is-democracy-at-work-not-the-deep-state) became public and congressional impeachment, until then an unlikely outcome, became a new political reality. Trump, in fact, was so publicly agitated about this swift and unexpected turn in his fortunes that the week of September 23rd was the single most active tweeting week of his Presidency. Trump sent out two hundred and forty tweets to his followers that week, easily beating his previous record of two hundred and seven, set during the week of July 7th. \n\nReading back over those tweets now, one can see the real-time realization by the President that, whatever he was doing, it wasnât working. Confidence about his âperfectâ call with Ukraineâs leader descended into self-pity, after he released the White House summary of the call and the controversy escalated instead of disappeared. Soon there were laments of âpresidential harassment.â By September 26th, Trump was talking about â*THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS*{:.small}â and retweeting validation from his son, his White House counsellor, his communications director, and his congressional allies. Over the weekend and into this week, the message seemed increasingly frenetic and muddled. One minute, Trump seemed to be shoring up his Republican base and attempting to change the subject to his policy feuds with Democrats; the next, he was deep into the details of the scandal, assailing the credibility of the whistle-blower and the investigators. Again. \n\nOn Wednesday, in two separate appearances alongside the visibly uncomfortable President of Finland, Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Trump ranted in such agitated and confused fashion that the dialogue at times resembled an absurdist play:\n\n>*Finnish reporter*{: .small}: Finland is the happiest country in the world.\n\n>*Trump*{: .small}: Finland is a happy country.\n\n>*Finnish reporter*{: .small}: What can you learn from Finland?\n\n> *Trump*{: .small}: Well, you got rid of Pelosi, and you got rid of shifty Schiff. Finland is a happy country. Heâs a happy leader, too. \n\nTrump, as that exchange so memorably suggests, just canât get over it. He canât even formulate a sentence in public that doesnât capture his obsessive focus on the political scandal that he created. Where previous embattled Presidents refused to discuss their plights, Trump can talk about nothing else. \n\nThe Presidentâs ability to capture public attention, however, is diminishing. He is caught in a cycle of greater and greater rhetorical excess, a cycle that predates the Ukraine scandal but helps explain his otherwise inexplicable behavior in responding to it. According to Factba.seâs week-by-week tracking, Trump began his escalatory spiral this spring, when the special counsel [Robert Muellerâs report](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-mueller-report-wont-end-trumps-presidency-but-it-sure-makes-him-look-bad) on Russiaâs 2016 election interference was released. Up until that point, the President had already been notable for his aggressive use of Twitter, his combative public statements, and his hostile relationship to the truth. But, in both frequency and volume, he was significantly more muted than he has been since the Mueller reportâs release. In the first two years of his Administration, there were only seven weeks when Trump tweeted more than a hundred times; since the Mueller report was made public, in April, he has done so every week except for two. \n\nThe Mueller investigation, and Trumpâs festering grievance about it, appears to have shaped his public persona more than any other event of his tenure. Trump publicly proclaimed victory with the reportâs release, portraying it as âcomplete and total exoneration.â âI won,â he said, but Trump did not take the win. Instead, he launched his Attorney General, [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-dangerous-position-of-william-barr), on what we know now was an international quest to investigate the origins of the Mueller investigation, pressuring U.S. allies from Britain to Italy to Australia, and also Ukraine, to unearth information that undermined the Mueller probeâs credibility. Who knows what will come out next. The impeachment investigation has just begun, and although it is starting out as tightly focussed on Ukraine, we have no real idea where it might end up. What we do know about Trump, though, is unlikely to change: the restraints on him are gone, and they are not coming back.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"},{"id":"5c2e1c8222d4972cd5b8329e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"China","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"china"},{"id":"5c2e1ca52bfcc72cd92d055e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Twitter","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"twitter"}],"sections":[{"id":"5abaab1276329f082506d466","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Trumpâs Washington","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-trumps-washington"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59d6671a65b89d2e73804d42","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Susan B.

(No credible evidence of such a conspiracy has emergedânor has an explanation for why Democrats would release private e-mails that damaged Hillary Clintonâs campaign and aided Trump.)\n\nOn Sunday, Tom Bossert, a former senior White House aide, told ABCâs âThis Weekâ that he had informed Trump that the theory was false, and blamed Trumpâs personal lawyer, [Rudolph Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), for [feeding it](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giuliani-is-a-one-man-wrecking-crew) to him. âI am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing, and repeating that debunked theory to the President,â he said. âIt sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again.â (Bossert later said, âIn fairness, I donât know that it was Rudy Giuliani that put that conspiracy theory into the Presidentâs head,â but âI know somebody did.â)\n\nBossertâs frustration echoes the concerns of several current and former Trump aides. All American Presidents are the focus of myriad disinformation campaigns designed to influence their thinking. Domestic political rivals use public statements and private flattery to attempt to sway the Presidentâs world view. Aides jostle to be seen as the most effective, resolute, and loyal lieutenant. But, under Trump, the amount of disinformation circulating in the White House has reached a new level, former Trump Administration officials told me. Trump is barraged with information from aides, political rivals, Fox News, and Twitter, much of it clearly designed to play to his long-held beliefs and biases. The former officials added that internecine battles among Trumpâs White House advisers sometimes exacerbate the amount of faulty information being presented to the President.\n\nSome aides also genuinely believe the conspiracy theories. This summer, a senior intelligence official [told me](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/trumps-message-to-us-intelligence-officials-be-loyal-or-leave) that Trumpâs Attorney General, [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-barr), is convinced that there is something nefarious in how the F.B.I. started its investigation, in 2016, of possible ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials. This spring, Trump authorized Barr to carry out sweeping reviews of the investigationâs origins and of an Intelligence Community assessment that found that Russia intervened in 2016 to benefit Trump. In May, Barr appointed the U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the review, but Trump and Barr have contributed to the investigation. This week, Justice Department officials confirmed that Barr had asked Trump to [personally request](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/us/politics/trump-australia-barr-mueller.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur) that the leader of Australia aid Barrâs inquiry, and also that Barr and Durham travelled to Italy last week to ask intelligence officials there to assist the probe. Former Justice Department officials expressed surprise about Barrâs involvement. A senior intelligence official called the claims of an international plotâsuch as the Obama Administration asking British intelligence to surveil Trump Towerââpreposterous.â The official pointed out that the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee has already investigated the origins of the F.B.I.âs Trump-Russia investigation and found no wrongdoing.\n\nSome former Trump Administration officials agreed that the President and some of his aides trafficked in conspiracy theories, but they also defended his policies. Although they recognized his personal flaws, they expressed support of his efforts to confront China, to force American allies to pay more for their own defense, and to prevent the U.S. from being drawn into another war in the Middle East. When presented with good information, they contended, the President makes good decisions. Others said that they had lost faith in the President and his policies after observing his decision-making. A former senior national-security official told me that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both did a better job of weighing information. âThatâs why the President gets the big bucks,â he told me. âTo discern where the preponderance of the evidence lies, to discern where the more persuasive argument lies.â\n\nThe former national-security official noted that disinformation had complicated Trumpâs decision-making regarding policy in Afghanistan, in 2017\\. Some aides were telling Trump that he should adopt a proposal from Erik Prince, the brother of the Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, to use private contractors rather than American soldiers to secure Afghanistan. The official said that the option was presented in an appealing but unrealistic way. âAn American company will do this cheaper and better without young Americans in uniform dying,â he said, paraphrasing the argument made by backers of the plan. Trump was also told that China was making large amounts of money in Afghanistan, while the U.S. provided the countryâs security, which played to Trumpâs sense that America was being taken advantage of by the Chinese. In fact, both claims were highly misleading. Guards from Princeâs former private-security company, Blackwater, had been convicted of killing more than a dozen civilians in a 2007 shooting in Baghdad; deploying a large number of Blackwater-like security contractors likely would have fuelled a surge in anti-American sentiment among Afghans and aided the Taliban insurgency. The scale of Chinese profits was exaggerated. American defense contracts had, in fact, made far larger profits in Afghanistan than had Chinese firms. In the end, the proposal to use private contractors was rejected, and Trump kept thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.\n\nLast year, conspiracy theories from outside the White House nearly derailed the passage of a major piece of legislation. On January 10, 2018, the White House issued a statement supporting the renewal of Section 702 of the *FISA*{: .small} Amendments Act, a post-9/11 program that allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect the communications of foreigners overseas without a warrantâincluding when they are speaking with Americans. The next morning, on âFox & Friends,â Andrew Napolitano, the networkâs top judicial analyst, directly appealed to Trump to change his position on the bill. âMr. President, this is not the way to go,â Napolitano [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/president-donald-trump-fisa/index.html). âSpying is valid to find the foreign agents among us. But itâs got to be based on suspicion and not an area code.â Napolitano went on to invoke the debunked conspiracy theory that British intelligence agencies had spied on Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. Napolitano had first floated the theory a year earlier; it was [repeated](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39300191) by Sean Spicer, then the White House press secretary. Stunned British intelligence officials, in a rare public rebuke, [dismissed the claim](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39300191) as ânonsenseâ and âutterly ridiculous.â The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee also investigated the claim and found it to be false.\n\nForty-five minutes after Napolitano asked Trump to oppose the law, the President [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951431836030459905), âThis is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?â Fearing that the legislation would fail to pass without Trumpâs support, aides convened an Oval Office meeting. John Kelly, then the White House chief of staff; H. R. McMaster, then the national-security adviser; Dan Coats, then the director of National Intelligence; Mike Pompeo, then the C.I.A. director; and Paul Ryan, then the Speaker of the House, who joined by phone, convinced Trump to reverse his reversal. âTodayâs vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,â [he tweeted](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/12/577744924/spy-bosses-helped-trump-draft-tweet-backing-surveillance-program). âWe need it! Get smart!â\n\nFormer officials said that they came to the conclusion that the character flaws they saw while working for Trump prevent the President from delivering on his agenda. They said that the President makes false statements, distrusts his own staff at times, and looks to outsiders for guidance. Now the pursuit of a conspiracy theory could lead to Trumpâs impeachment. Under attack, Trump is defending himself in the way he knows howâby claiming that the whistle-blower complaint is itself a conspiracy. On Wednesday, he said that he believed Representative Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House Intelligence Committee, âhelped writeâ the complaint, and dismissed it as a âscam.â Schiff flatly denied Trumpâs claims.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Earlier in the day, three congressional committees had issued Giuliani with subpoenas for documents and records relating to his role in the Ukraine scandal. Hannity asked if he would agree to testify to Congress. âOh, I donât know. Iâm weighing the alternatives,â Giuliani [said](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/giuliani-tells-hannity-hes-weighing-the-alternatives-on-testifying-if-they-let-me-use-video-tapes-and-tape-recordings/), stroking his chin. âIâll get all my evidence together. Iâll get my charts. I donât know. If they let me use videotapes and tape recordings that I haveâif they let me.â Then he changed the subject.\n\nThink for a moment about what Giuliani said. By his own account, he not only took part in an effort to persuade a foreign government to investigate a political rival of the Presidentâ[Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden)âbut also recorded at least some of this activity on videotape and audiotape. Heâs even got charts. Itâs almost as if he wanted posterity, or congressional investigators, to have a full record of his Ukraine caper, which is now the subject of a Presidential impeachment inquiry. Armed with their subpoenas, the committees on Capitol Hill will likely get access to any Ukraine-related materials that Giuliani possesses, including tapes, e-mails, travel records, and other documents.\n\nRather than handing over the evidence, Giuliani could conceivably try to assert client-attorney privilege. âI gathered all this evidence before the [Mueller probe](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation) ended, so it was clearly under my responsibility, as the lawyer for the President of the United States,â he told Hannity. But, just last week, in [an interview](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/giuliani-ukraine-trump-biden/598879/) with Elaina Plott, a White House correspondent for *The Atlantic*, he said the opposite: âIâm not acting as a lawyer. Iâm acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government. Anything I did should be praised.â It was almost as if Giuliani was deliberately sabotaging his ability to defy a subpoena.\n\nThis type of behavior raises a question that has long mystified many people in Washington, including some senior members of the Trump Administration: What is Rudy up to? In meeting, at the start of this year, with Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, and pressing him about Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company that hired [Hunter Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), he embarked down a path that has led to a Presidential-impeachment probe, and also dragged into the mire a host of other senior Administration officials, including Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pompeo) and Attorney General [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-barr). On Tuesday, the *Wall Street Journal* [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tense-relationship-between-barr-and-giuliani-complicates-trump-impeachment-defense-11569942261) that Barr and Giuliani are now âstruggling to get on the same page.â You donât say.\n\nHistorians of the Trump Administration may well recall the seventy-five-year-old New Yorker as a one-man wrecking crew. But what is his motivation? One theory is that heâs lost it mentally. âA senior House Republican aide bashed Giuliani, telling me he was a âmoron,â&nbsp;â Plott noted.Â Since his heyday in City Hall, as the mayor of New York, he certainly appears to have experienced a decline. On some occasions, such as during [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6EHQKL2wdo) that he did with CNNâs Chris Cuomo a couple of weeks ago, when he first denied asking the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens and then boasted about it, Giuliani can seem a bit deranged.\n\nHowever, he also displayed great doggedness and determination in pursuing his Ukraine probe, even as some of Trumpâs own staff dismissed it as baseless. This past weekend, the *Times* [quoted](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/28/us/politics/how-a-shadow-foreign-policy-in-ukraine-prompted-impeachment-inquiry.html) a former White House aide who said that Giuliani would âfeed Trump all kinds of garbage,â which created âa real problem for all of us.â Evidently, he was together enough to carry out his own inquiries, navigate around a hostile White House staff, and get his message over to the President. \n\nIf this was a dystopian thriller, one could imagine Giuliani as an undercover saboteur, who was ordered to embed himself as deeply as possible within Team Trump and then bide his time. In 2016, he proved his bona fides with Trump by publicly defending him after the appearance of the âAccess Hollywoodâ tape, and then he accompanied Trump on his final campaign swing. In 2018, after [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller) was appointed as special counsel, Giuliani reappeared as the public face of the Presidentâs legal-defense team. With other lawyers conducting most of the actual legal work, he had plenty of time for pursuing other projects, including a certain oppo-research effort in Kiev. And what a job he made of it.\n\nGiuliani isnât an undercover operative, of course. Heâs a retired politician who couldnât bear to be out of the spotlight and who saw, in Trumpâs rise, a way to get back on the stage. Heâs also a rich security consultant, whose clients include Eastern European moguls with ties to the Ukrainian government. In promoting to Trump the unfounded theory that Biden blackmailed Ukraineâs government to protect his son, these two streams in Giulianiâs life came together. And you have to give him some credit, at least, for knowing his client. Outside the confines of 4chan, there is probably nobody in America more partial to conspiracy theories than Trump.\n\nWhatever Giuliani thought he was doing, the great irony is that, by luring Trump into the Ukraine folly, he has ended up bloodying him more seriously than Mueller or [James Comey](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/james-comey) ever did. Many Trump allies fervently wish that Giuliani would shut up and go away, but there is no chance of that happening. On Tuesday night, he appeared on another Fox News show, hosted by Laura Ingraham, where he said that he was considering launching civil suits against individual congressional Democrats, for taking part in âa conspiracy to violate civil rightsââi.e., his and Trumpâs. âThis is worse than McCarthy,â he [added](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKxW5Qz_n9o).\n\nIngraham, a former lawyer who once clerked for Supreme Court Justice [Clarence Thomas](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/clarence-thomas), politely pointed out that Giulianiâs legal theory was ânovel.â Then she tried to divert him to a question about Hunter Biden and the media. Giuliani wasnât having it. âCan we go back to my lawsuit?â he asked. At which point Ingraham turned away from the camera and said, with a tight smile, âHeâs unbelievable.â\n\nThat he is. And Trumpâs political enemies are very grateful for his efforts.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rudy Giuliani","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rudy-giuliani"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

According to Justice Department officials and the whistle-blower complaint about [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)âs phone call with the Ukrainian President, Barr knew of Trumpâs effort to get Ukraine to interfere in the [2020 election](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/2020-election) by investigating a possible rival, former Vice-President [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), and of the Departmentâs subsequent suppression of the whistle-blower complaint. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Barr of being part of a âcoverup of the coverup,â and signalled that the Attorney General will be a focus of the investigation. âI do think the Attorney General has gone rogueâhe has for a long time now,â Pelosi told CNN. âAnd, since he was mentioned in all of this, itâs curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.â\n\nThe record of Barrâs Justice Department supports Pelosiâs assessment. When the complaint arrived at the Department, the Office of Legal Counsel ruled that it was not an âurgent concernââa decision questioned by Democratsâand therefore should not be handed over to Congress. And then, in a more surprising move, the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division declined to investigate the whistle-blowerâs allegation that the President had engaged in criminal conduct. Department officials played down Barrâs role, saying that he was âgenerally knowledgeableâ of discussions about the O.L.C. decision to find the complaint not urgent, but was not involved in the Criminal Divisionâs decision to decline to investigate the allegation. They also maintain that the Departmentâs decisions about the complaint were based on legal considerations, not political ones.\n\nThe distinction between legal and political considerations in these cases, though, is not so simple. Both the O.L.C. and the Criminal Division are led by Trump appointees, who, like Barr, are generally defenders of the power of Presidents to act unilaterally and limit congressional involvement. [Human-rights groups](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/07/groups-express-concern-over-us-office-legal-counsel-nominee) questioned the role of Steven Engel, the head of the O.L.C., in the drafting of a 2007 Justice Department legal memo that authorized the use of interrogation techniquesâsuch as sleep deprivation for up to ninety-six hours and forcing detainees to wear diapersâthat are widely considered torture. Brian Benczkowski, who leads the Criminal Division, has been [criticized by Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/after-more-than-a-year-senate-confirms-nominee-to-lead-justice-department-criminal-division/2018/07/11/53fc96ac-839f-11e8-8f6c-46cb43e3f306_story.html) for having little experience prosecuting cases and close political ties to Trumpâs former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and other conservative Republicans.\n\nMary McCord, a former senior Justice Department official and a professor at Georgetown Law School, questioned the Criminal Divisionâs decision not to investigate. âI find it very surprising that Justice Department lawyers would find that thereâs nothing here worth exploring,â McCord, who led the Departmentâs National Security Division from 2016 to 2017, told me. McCord, who has also prosecuted government officials on corruption charges, added that a request from Trump to Ukraine for interference in the 2020 election did not, as some Republicans have maintained, need to be explicit. âItâs ridiculous to expect that youâre going to see that kind of language,â she said. âItâs what you see in other corruption cases. You see these kinds of somewhat guarded language.â\n\nRichard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law, [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-rejected-investigation-of-trump-phone-call-just-weeks-after-it-began-examining-the-matter/2019/09/25/6f7977ce-dfb5-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html) the Washington *Post* last week that the Criminal Divisionâs failure to investigate the case was âlaughable.â He criticized the Criminal Divisionâs finding that the value of a Ukrainian government investigation of Biden could not be quantified and therefore could not be investigated as a possible campaign-finance-law violation. âYouâre talking about information on a potential rival that could be used in a presidential campaign, a presidential campaign which likely would run into the billions of dollars,â Hasen said. âI donât think thereâs any question that a prosecutor could go forward with the theory.â\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBarr, who served in his current role previously, under George&nbsp;H.&nbsp;W. Bush, is only the second American to have served twice as Attorney General. When he replaced Sessions, in February, 2019, he was seen as a skilled lawyer and experienced Washington hand who could act as a restraining influence on Trump. Since he took office, however, Barr has become one of Trumpâs closest aides and the [focus of complaints](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/25/william-barrs-role-is-about-get-lot-more-scrutiny/) that he is the most politicized Attorney General in decades. Critics accuse him of repeatedly using his authority to benefit the President politically, helping Trump mount an unprecedented assault on Congressâs oversight of the executive branch and the President.\n\nFirst, in March, Barr produced a misleading summary of the special counsel Robert Muellerâs final report on the Russia investigation, in which Barr cleared the President of wrongdoing. âI have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counselâs investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,â Barr wrote. Mueller, in fact, had found ten potential episodes of obstruction of justice, but left it up to Congress to decide whether Trump was guilty. When congressional Democrats tried to investigate the potential acts of obstruction by subpoenaing the Trump aides who witnessed it, Barrâs Justice Department issued a legal opinion that the staffers were not required to testify before Congress.\n\nIn recent months, Barr has amplified Trumpâs threats to law-enforcement and intelligence officials. During congressional testimony in April, Barr said that the F.B.I. may have spied on Trump, giving credence to conspiracy theories spread by the President that the F.B.I. had improperly wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, a claim flatly denied by F.B.I. officials. âSpying on a political campaign is a big deal,â Barr told senators. âI think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.â A month later, Trump announced that Barr was carrying out a sweeping investigation of the origins of the F.B.I.âs Trump-Russia investigation. Democrats said that Barrâs actions sent a message to law-enforcement and intelligence officials that they would face retaliation if they investigated Trump.\n\nThe Ukraine phone call sets another precedent. In his conversation with the Ukrainian President, [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/volodymyr-zelensky), Trump said that Barr was a participant in the Presidentâs effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden. Trump, of course, could have been lying to Zelensky. Trump also may never have followed up with Barr after the call. Either way, the President has smeared Barr and fuelled calls for the Attorney General to be investigated. Barr, who claims he never spoke with Trump about Zelensky, now faces a decision. Will he uphold his own reputation or that of the President, who is impugning him?\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBarr might recall the example of John Mitchell, who, in 1975, became the firstâand onlyâformer Attorney General of the United States to be sent to prison. Mitchell served as Richard Nixonâs Attorney General from 1969 to 1972, and then as chairman of Nixonâs 1972 Presidential reÃ«lection campaign. As campaign chairman, he oversaw the Watergate break-ins and then participated in the coverup. Unlike other aides who broke with Nixon and implicated the President, Mitchell declined to reveal his conversations with the President. He was convicted by a jury of his peers of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury for his role in Watergate. Mitchell served nineteen months in federal prison before being released, for medical reasons.\n\nFor many in the American legal community, though, Mitchellâs actions before Watergate were more troubling. While serving as Attorney General, Mitchell hatched secretâand, at times, bizarreâplots to aid Nixon politically. He investigated government officials and journalists suspected of leaking damaging information about the President. He prosecuted opponents of the Vietnam War. And he controlled a secret slush fund used to smear Democratic Presidential candidates deemed a threat to Nixon. In one simultaneously abhorrent and amateurish act, Mitchell approved a payment of ten thousand dollars to a faction of the American Nazi Party in order to carry out a failed effort to remove Governor George Wallace from a Presidential ballot in California. Nixon aides believed that supporters of Wallaceâan avowed segregationist running as a third-party candidateâwould shift their votes to Nixon. \n\nJudges later found Mitchellâs actions, such as wiretapping Americans without court orders, to be not only illegal but unconstitutional. He had used his powers as Attorney General to harass and smear Americans engaged in constitutionally protected political activityâfrom leading Democratic politicians to street protesters. After Nixon resigned and Mitchell was sent to prison, an elaborate series of norms and rules was established to prevent the President from acting like an authoritarian rulerâand the Attorney General from acting like the Presidentâs personal lawyer.\n\nSince Mitchell, Attorneys General have also worked to restore public faith in the independence of the Justice Department. Edward Levi, a conservative legal scholar whom Gerald Ford appointed as the first post-Watergate Attorney General, was hailed by both political parties for restoring neutrality and integrity to the office. In an attempt to cement Leviâs legacy, multiple Republican and Democratic Attorneys General have recused themselves from investigations involving the Presidents who appointed them. During the Clinton Administration, Janet Reno recused herself from the Whitewater investigation, which led to Clintonâs impeachment. During the George W. Bush Administration, Attorneys General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales both recused themselves from an investigation of the leak of the C.I.A. agent Valerie Plameâs identity. Barr has an opportunity to do the same and recuse himself from the Trump-Ukraine investigationâto show that he represents the best interests of the American people, not those of Donald Trump. So far, he has declined to do so.\n  \n*A previous version of this article mischaracterized a Justice Department legal memo from 2007 that authorized interrogation techniques.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c93e56e652c90274687","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"William Barr","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"william-barr"},{"id":"5c2e1d774a08312cd3aa6d2d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Attorney General","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"attorney-general"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

The buyer was Answers in Genesis, a Christian nonprofit based in Kentucky, which was founded by the Australian creationist Ken Ham. Answers in Genesis is dedicated to promoting young-Earth creationism, which holds that the Earth was created in six days, several thousand years ago. According to documents related to the sale, Meadows was to be paid about two hundred thousand dollars for the property, in monthly installments, the last of which was paid last year. \n\nNeither the sale nor any such payments are noted on Meadowsâs [congressional financial disclosures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bZfjUtuIaSHcBbGgWj5k2Oe3W2bm4ln2/view?usp=sharing), which he is required by law to file annually. Meadows is a founding member of the very conservative House Freedom Caucus and is one of the more prominent members of Congress; last year, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) reportedly considered making him the White House chief of staff. Why didnât Meadows disclose the property or the sale? The congressman declined to comment for this story. In August, the [Charlotte *Observer* reported](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article233998942.html) that Meadowsâwho, before becoming a congressman, was a successful real-estate developerâowned land in northeastern North Carolina that he had also failed to list on his disclosure reports. Itâs possible that these nondisclosures reflect a pattern of ignoring congressional reporting rules.\n\n \n\nItâs also possible that Meadows wanted to avoid drawing attention to the Colorado property and the complicated and perhaps unflattering story behind it. The property is not an ordinary piece of land but a rich site for finding dinosaur bones, and this appears to be the primary reason that Meadows bought it. Those bones then became the subject of a long-running fight among young-Earth creationistsâand they  are likely the reason that Meadows sold the land, ultimately, to Answers in Genesis. Meadowsâs involvement with the land may have been, in part, a moneymaking venture, but it seems chiefly to reflect his commitment to, and entanglement with, the contentious and controversial world of creationist paleontology.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nDoug Phillips, a fifty-four-year-old contractor and documentary filmmaker, was, at one time, a part of that world. Heâs the son of Howard Phillips, who founded the Constitution Party and was a key figure in the rise of the religious right. For several years, Doug Phillips worked as a lawyer at the Home School Legal Defense Association, a Christian nonprofit that lobbies for homeschool-friendly legislation and provides legal support to homeschooling families. In 1998, he founded Vision Forum Ministries, best known for its insistence on Biblical patriarchyâa creed that holds, among other things, that â[the woman was created as a helper to her husband](https://web.archive.org/web/20070626134919/http:/www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx)â and that âthe God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household.â Phillips also maintained a commercial offshoot of the ministry, Vision Forum, Inc., which sold books and other materials to Christian consumers. \n\nIn the spring of 2002, he co-organized a fossil-hunting expedition called the Dragonâs Den Dig, which was advertised to evangelical homeschoolersâattending the outing cost nine hundred and ninety-five dollars for adults and children older than ten. Phillipsâs partner in the venture was Pete DeRosa, a Florida entrepreneur whom heâd met at a homeschooling conference. DeRosa ran a family operation, later incorporated as Creation Expeditions, that took homeschoolers out to swim with manatees and taught âa fresh approach to ecology from a Creationistâs perspective.â The Dragonâs Den Dig promised to give kids the excitement of hunting for dinosaur bones while teaching them that fossils provide evidence for the flood described in the Book of Genesis.\n\n \n\nThis explanation of the fossil record has been around for more than a century, and it prevails among young-Earth creationists. It has particular traction with evangelical homeschoolers, many of whom adhere to that version of creationism and also have to give their kids science lessons. âFor homeschooling parents who want to teach their children that the earth is only a few thousand years old, the theory of evolution is a lie, and dinosaurs coexisted with humans, there is no shortage of materials,â a writer for the *Atlantic* [noted](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/03/old-earth-young-minds-evangelical-homeschoolers-embrace-evolution/273844/), in 2013\\. âKids can start with the Answers in Genesis curriculum, which features books such as [*Dinosaurs of Eden*](http://www.amazon.com/Dinosaurs-Eden-Tracing-Mystery-Through/dp/0890513406), written by Creation Museum founder Ken Ham.â \n\nMark Meadows and his wife homeschooled their children, and, in May, 2002, they took them on the Dragonâs Den Dig. The first two days of the expedition were to be spent on day trips in Utah, with time allotted for white-water rafting and digging for fossils in Cowboy Canyon, according to an itinerary for the event. (âKeep what you find!â the itinerary promises.) The other three days were set aside for digging at a site in Dinosaur, Colorado.\n\n \n\nShortly after the trip, Vision Forum put out a surprising [press release](https://web.archive.org/web/20020806200942/http:/www.visionforum.com/aboutvf/welcome/newsletter/0205/): âHome School Expedition Uncovers Rare Allosaur and Giant Sauropod.â According to the release, a father from Missouri who was at the dig discovered an allosaurus skull, and âthe claws to a 100-foot *Sauropod*, presently believed to be of the rare *Ultrasaurus* variety,â were found by ânine-year-old home schooler Haley Meadows.â The release claimed that the group found the fossils âlaying in a bed of leaves and plant debris,â with partly petrified âwood from trees mixed in among the bonesââevidence, the release suggested, that the creatures had been buried by âa relatively recent and catastrophic event similar to that described in the Bible as the Flood of Noahâs day.â\n\n \n\nâThey say, âWell, we found the allosaur with some plants and some wood next to it,â â the paleontologist Kirk Johnson said, when I asked him about the claims in the press release. âItâs, like, Well, yeah, the dinosaur lived in a forest.â Johnson, the director of the Smithsonianâs National Museum of Natural History, grew up a Seventh-Day Adventist, believing that Earth was created in six days and that the fossil record was formed by the Biblical flood. âI learned a lot about evolution because my church was trying to explain to me that it made no sense,â he told me. In his first year of college, he took a geology course that âcompletely changedâ his life; after getting his Ph.D., at Yale, in 1989, he spent twenty-two years at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science. He visited the dig site in Dinosaur, Colorado, in 2002, roughly around the time of the Dragonâs Den Dig. During his visit, he heard that creationist fossil hunters had recently been there. âWhere they were digging is certainly a place that has, and does, and will produce dinosaurs,â he said. But, he added, âItâs markedly not four thousand years old.â\n\n \n\nA few months after the dig, Vision Forum, Inc., released a documentary called âRaising the Allosaur: The True Story of a Rare Dinosaur and the Home Schoolers Who Found It.â The filmâs voice-over is credited to a Winston MacArthur, who sounds a lot like Phillips. âAn unusual group of thirty parents and their children journeyed to these badlands to participate in an experiment,â he says. âA rare experiment in paleontology and a unique search for one of the most elusive dinosaurs, the allosaur.â The narrator describes the DeRosa family as having âa decade of experience in field excavation.â The goal of their project, he explains, is to âbring the lordship of Jesus Christ to the field of science.â\n\n \n\nMeadows appears in the movie several times. As the film is building to the climactic discovery of the allosaur skull, he describes a remarkable experience that he and his daughter have just had. âWe were working towards the end of the day here, just trying to get one last bit of rock out before, you know, before we finished,â he says, when, âall of a sudden, we spotted a little bit of bone, we thoughtâand we found a claw.â\n\n +++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d8e7d361008f90009935387]||||||\n+++\n\nThe narrator says that the fossils were uncovered and delivered to a âlaboratory.â He adds, âThe tide is turning in the battle over origins. And the âDeRosa dinosaurâ may prove to be a critical tool in this battle. For the first time in more than a century, the Christian community of creation scientists is in possession of a rare, world-class Theropod skeleton: an allosaur.â As for the kids on the expedition, he says, âThese young men and women will rise up to be the great defenders of Biblical and scientific truth in the twenty-first century.â\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nBy the time the film was released, however, the claim that the homeschoolers had found the dinosaur had become the subject of acrimonious dispute in the world of creationist fossil hunting. According to multiple accounts, the bones were not discovered during the Dragonâs Den Dig; they were found in the fall of 2000, by the man who then owned the property, a local schoolteacher named Dana Forbes. And they were mostly excavated several months later, by a team that was led by a young-Earth creationist and fossil hunter named Joe Taylor.\n\n \n\nForbes told me recently about his discovery. âI was going down the slope of a hill one day, seeing bone fragments that had floated to the surface,â he said. âI thought, âO.K., itâs coming from a source.â So I started tracking back to where they seemed to be popping out.â Forbes is a young-Earth creationist, and he mentioned at church one Sunday that he had found fossils on his property. A man in the pews that day told him about creationist paleontologists who were digging in the area, including Taylor, the owner and curator of the Mt. Blanco Fossil Museum, in Crosbyton, Texas. (Its motto: âDigging Up the Facts of Godâs Creation.â) Taylor came to see the bones, and identified them as belonging to an allosaurus. He made a deal with Forbes to excavate and mount the bones, and, in September, 2001, he supervised the removal of about twelve feet of the allosaurâs spine, with a crew that included the DeRosas, whom heâd met at a church in Fort Lauderdale, earlier that year. According to a letter written by Taylorâs lawyer, a year and a half later, the dig was partly funded by Answers in Genesis.\n\n \n\nâIâve got two hundred pounds of paperwork on the whole deal,â Taylor, who is now in his mid-seventies, told me over the phone, as he drove to his fossil facility, in rural Texas, this spring. Taylor, who has a long white beard and is fond of cowboy hats, speaks with more humor than bitterness about the whole incident now. He says that, after the initial dig, he gave the DeRosas permission to lead educational outings on the site, for which they could charge a bit of money. But the DeRosas, according to Taylor, set up a side deal with Doug Phillips, to make a movie, without informing Taylor. âWe trusted everybody to make an honest report,â he said. âAnd they were claiming in their P.R., and then the film, that these little homeschooler kids went in search of an allosaur, found an allosaur, excavated the allosaur, plus a stegosaur and a one-hundred-and-twenty-foot-long sauropod thatâd be about thirty feet tall, all in four days.â\n\n \n\nCould that be done?\n\n \n\nâImpossible,â Taylor said. âI mean, it took us professional diggers two weeks just to get out twelve feet of the spine and the skull of the allosaur. Had the legs been there, itâd take another three weeks. Their claim was utterly ridiculous. They didnât do any of that.â The homeschoolers did âmove some dirt,â Taylor said, but they did not discover any major bones or perform any real excavation.\n\nDeRosa insisted, in an e-mail, that Taylor âwas paid by us to come and help on the dig.â He alluded to an agreement between the DeRosas and the Forbes family which was signed shortly before the Dragonâs Den Digâand he noted that his family was not paid for participating in the movie, did not make any money from its sale, and did not control its content.\n\n \n\nIn April, 2004, Taylor and DeRosa agreed to participate in a Christian mediation, a process in which an independent adjudicator attempts to resolve conflicts according to Biblical principles. While the dispute was ongoing, the political activist Michael Peroutka stepped in. Peroutka told me that he met the DeRosas on a âFaith and Freedomâ tour of New England, organized by Vision Forum. He and his brother had previously established the Elizabeth Streb Peroutka Foundationâand he was considering a run for President, on the Constitution Party line. The foundation offered to pay Taylor $124,843\\.75 for his share of the allosaur, allowing the DeRosas to [keep the fossils in Florida](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-2005-12-20-fossils20-story.html). A former member of Phillipsâs church told me that Phillips urged his parishioners to vote for Peroutka in 2004, although not by name. âWe needed to honor God, defend the family, and restore the Republic,â Peroutka told me. He said that he first met Phillips through his father, and âdidnât deal with Doug in respect to the allosaur.â \n\nâIt was a bad deal that we had to accept,â Taylor said, of the money he received from the foundation. âEverybody was tired of fighting. I said at the time, âThis will put me out of business. This leaves me ninety thousand dollars in debt.â From what I owed Forbes. What I owed my two brothers for keeping us going through that time. For my lawyer. All the costs of defending the bones.â The foundation later listed the fossils as having a fair market value of four hundred and fifty thousand dollars; Kirk Johnson told me that was a fair assessment, at the high end of the market.\n\nIn October, 2004, Vision Forum suspended the sale of âRaising the Allosaur,â citing âa series of ethics-based issues.â You can still find the film online, however: it was uploaded to Vimeo five years ago, where it has received a single âlike.â It can be purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Raising-Allosaur-Story-Dinosaur-Schooler/dp/1929241615/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=raising+the+allosaur&qid=1563639123&s=gateway&sr=8-1) for $1\\.86.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nToward the end of the movie, the narrator says, âIn Godâs providence, even the one hundred twenty acres of this property has been purchased for the continued use of Creation Expeditions.â This is a reference to Meadows, who bought the land from Forbes a few months after the dig, and subsequently leased it to DeRosa. When I spoke to Forbes recently, over the phone, he hesitated to explain why Meadows bought the land, asking that I follow up by e-mail. Before hanging up, he added, âMy wife says, âMark Meadows had no interest in benefitting from that property.â Just an F.Y.I.â I asked what she meant. âSelling it for a huge profit or something like that,â he said. Later, in an e-mail, Forbes told me that he had sold the property to Meadows because âthere was concern that I might end up losingâ it, âdue to financial circumstances beyond my control.â Meadows, he explained, planned âto keep it open for future exploration.â He âtreated us fairly and gave a fair price,â Forbes added. Taylor also told me that Meadows bought the land with the âgood intentionâ of helping to advance the work of young-Earth creationists.\n\n \n\nAmong the handful of countries where the vast majority of dinosaur fossils have been discovered, the United States is the only one where such bones, when found on private property, belong to the landowner, rather than to the government. âIt is this legal structure that allows creationists to dig dinosaurs and pretend to be paleontologists,â Kirk Johnson explained. By keeping the land in the hands of young-Earth creationists, Meadows would insure that they could tell the story of any fossils found there. âHe bought it to secure it for Pete,â Taylor told me, referring to DeRosa. Creation Expeditions, DeRosaâs company, conducted more fossil tours on the site, as did Vision Forum. âThat ten-year contract let them just do whatever they wanted,â Taylor said. âPete and his sons took a bunch of people in there, made a lot of money on tours. It was a commercial operation.â\n\n \n\nAccording to the lease, the DeRosas were to pay a percentage of the proceeds from sales of fossil material found on the land to the Forbes family and a thousand dollars a year to Meadows. But, according to Taylor, Meadows broke the DeRosasâ lease in the summer of 2003, when he discovered âthat their paleontology expertise was not what they said it was.â\n\n \n\nThe Christian mediation resulted in an agreement that included a non-disparagement clause. (Among other things, Taylor agreed not to release a documentary he had made, called âThe Truth About the Raising of the Allosaur. â) In 2007, an arbitrator ruled that Taylor had violated that clause twenty times, and ordered him to pay a fine of a hundred thousand dollars. âHow sad that among Christian brethren, we are torn apart by pride, greed, and bitterness,â the arbitrator concluded, noting that the bones âcould have, and should have, been a major victory in the culture war for those on the Creation science side.â \n\nâThe DeRosa family went on to basically ruin my life and shut the museum down, over who owned the bones,â Taylor said. Whatâs more, he went on, his opponents in the fight, the men behind the Dragonâs Den Dig, were shown to be dishonorable: âAbout three years or so ago, Doug finally admitted to carrying on with his nanny.â In 2013, Phillips admitted to having an affair with a woman who alleged, in a lawsuit, that he began grooming her at the age of fifteen. Phillips insists that the relationship did not begin until she was an adult, and that, as he wrote in his resignation from Vision Forum Ministries, âwe did not âknowâ each other in a Biblical sense.â The lawsuit was ultimately settled and dismissed by the plaintiff. Vision Forum Ministries was shut down in November of that year, and Vision Forum, Inc., closed a couple of months later.\n\n \n\nPhillips still works on movies, but he told me that he hadnât thought much about the allosaur documentary in years. In an e-mail, he explained, âI met Mark Meadows at the dino dig, but donât remember having any substantive conversations with him, and know little about his personal and political views.â \n\nTaylor said he felt wronged by how the drama surrounding the skeleton had played out, but, he added, âI donât hate Doug. I donât hate Pete or any of those guys. I pray for them every night, that God will bless them and help them, bring them to repentance.â\n\n \n\nâMark Meadows was used by Doug and the DeRosas,â he added later, in an e-mail. âThe whole affair is probably very regretful to him, as it is to all of us.â\n\n \n\nFive years ago, the Peroutka Foundation donated the skeleton to the Creation Museum, which is operated by Answers in Genesis. The museum had the skeleton reappraised, and declared its value at a million dollars. It is now one of the museumâs main attractions. On the front of the display is a note thanking the DeRosas; no credit is given to Forbes or Taylor. âThe intact skeleton of this allosaur is a testimony to a catastrophic, rapid burial, which is confirmation of the global Flood a few thousand years ago as recorded in the Bible,â the Creation Museum insists, [on its Web site](https://creationmuseum.org/dinosaurs-dragons/allosaurus/). âThere is no correlation between the age and intactness of a fossil skeleton,â Kirk Johnson explained, in an e-mail. He added, âIt is important to note that their claim is demonstrably and profoundly incorrect.â \n\nTwo years after the allosaur was installed at the Creation Museum, Answers in Genesis bought the land where the skeleton was found, from Meadows. A spokesman for Answers in Genesis said, in an e-mail, âWe are considering a few uses for the property.â\n\n \n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d44748c070289000964622a]||||||\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBrett Kappel, a lawyer whose work focusses on campaign finance and congressional ethics, reviewed documents related to the sale and ownership of the land in Colorado. Meadowsâs failure to disclose the sale appears to be a violation of the Ethics in Government Act, Kappel said, and it would not be his first: Meadows was sanctioned last year for [failing to act appropriately](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/16/house-ethics-committee-sanctions-meadows-kihuen-997339) in response to sexual-harassment charges made against a staffer in his congressional office, and for using taxpayer money to pay the alleged harasser after he had been demoted and seemed to no longer be doing congressional work.\n\n \n\nâThere appear to have been multiple reporting violations that occurred over a long period of time,â Kappel told me. They would have started in 2012, when Meadows became a candidate for Congress and did not list the Colorado property in his financial disclosures. Candidates and freshman members of Congress donât always know the rules, Kappel noted, but someone running for his third term, as Meadows was in 2016, should have known that âa two-hundred-thousand-dollar sale of real propertyâ would have to be disclosedâand that, at the very least, he should seek guidance from the staff of the House Ethics Committee or from outside counsel. By then, Meadows was being investigated by the committee for his handling of the charges against his staffer, and he may have been reluctant to âcall attention to any additional ethics issues,â Kappel suggested. A spokesperson for the committee declined to offer a comment for this story.\n\n \n\nAccording to congressional ethics guidelines, a property must be reported if it is held for investment, regardless of whether it generates any income. âThe fact that there had been an agreement to lease the property to fossil hunters, even if the rent was never paid, seriously undermines the argument that the property was not held for investment,â Kappel said. Is it possible, I asked him, that Meadows regarded both the purchase and the sale of the property as an attempt to assist in the research efforts of young-Earth creationists, and therefore not really as a commercial endeavor? A lawyer might try to make that argument, Kappel said, but, if that was Meadowsâs primary concern, why not donate the land, rather than selling it?\n\n \n\nMeadows is not the only member of Congress who has helped advance the cause of creationist paleontology. The family foundation of Representative Greg Gianforte, of Montanaâwho is best known, nationally, for [body-slamming a reporter](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-republican-greg-gianforte-body-slammed-reporter/story?id=58610691)âprovided nearly three hundred thousand dollarsâ worth of funding to the [Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum](https://billingsgazette.com/news/features/magazine/dinosaur-museum-presents-biblical-view-of-origins/article_1c9ac218-bab0-11de-84f1-001cc4c002e0.html), which teaches that dinosaurs travelled on Noahâs Ark. According to a recent Gallup poll, [forty per cent of American adults](https://news.gallup.com/poll/261680/americans-believe-creationism.aspx) adhere to âa strictly creationist view of human origins,â and some polls have found that a similar number believe or are open to the idea that [people and dinosaurs shared the Earth](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2015/06/18/jurassic-world). Politicians who wish to signal their adherence to young-Earth creationism but want to avoid potentially embarrassing headlines tend to answer questions on the subject with the broadest of generalities. When Gianforte was asked by a reporter whether he believed that life on Earth has been shaped by evolution, he replied, âI personally believe, as many Montanans do, that God created the Earth.â He declined to further elaborate.\n\n \n\nMeadows is very open about his faith and has been an outspoken advocate for homeschooling as a congressman. When he first ran for Congress, he was endorsed by Michael Farris, the founder of the Home School Legal Defense Association, where Doug Phillips worked before creating Vision Forum. (Farris distanced himself from Phillips following the reports of Phillipsâs relationship with his nanny; Farris also insisted that he was âuncomfortableâ with Phillipsâs âpatriarchy theoryâ for years, though this [has been disputed](https://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2014/04/michael-farris-patriarchy-and-doug-phillips-an-expose.html).) âI think heâs one of the best members of Congress, by far,â Farris told me, of Meadows. âHeâs stood up for religious freedom. He has a backbone, and heâs stood by the issues that he campaigned on.â Farris is also the founder of Patrick Henry College, which mandates the teaching of creationism and also touts the number of [White House internships that its students receive](https://www.phc.edu/news/013018-phc-students-alumni-white-house). Meadowsâs son is a graduate; Meadows delivered a commencement address there last year. I asked Farris whether he knew anything about Meadowsâs views on the age of the Earth. âWeâve never talked about creationism, but I would assume that he, like me, believes in creation,â Farris said.\n\n \n\nJoe Taylor told me that, as far as politics goes, heâs âon Markâs side, and Doug Phillipsâs sideâeven though Doug ruined the whole patriarch movement, which Iâve been promoting for years.â When he knew Meadows, he said, their beliefs regarding the Earthâs history were basically the same. âAt the time, he took Ken Hamâs traditional position,â he explained. âThe Bibleâs literal word.â I noted that, as a congressman, Meadows has not publicly identified himself as a creationist, nor has he publicly questioned evolution or argued against the teaching of it in schools. âAny politician is going to try to limit stories with hard questions they donât really know the answers to, or itâs embarrassing that they were involved with,â Taylor said. âIt happens all the time. I mean, Iâm surprised this allosaur story has stayed still this long. Iâm surprised it hasnât broken as a major Rachel Maddow story. She did one [on Ken Ham](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/watch/dinosaur-find-cited-as-proof-of-bible-story-268002371823) one time,â he added, saying of the MSNBC anchor, âI donât care much for her reporting.â\n\n \n\nTaylor added, âThe last time I believe Mark and I talked, he called me and wanted to know what it would cost to prep up one of those sauropod leg bones, to plaster and protect them. I gave him a bid. I said, âHereâs what it costs.â â Nothing ever came of it. âI donât know if he was just trying to help me or he was trying to help some museum somewhere. Maybe Ken Ham. I donât know. I havenât had any contact with Mark in years. I get his political newsletter; thatâs it.â\n\n \n\nAs for Answers in Genesis, Taylor said, it should have made a film using his footage for the allosaur display, to tell the real story of its excavation. But, he said, âI donât want to paint A.I.G. in a bad light. Theyâre doing good work. And so is Mark Meadows.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c94b75f002c8941e499","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c94b75f002c8941e499","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Paleontologists","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"paleontologists"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Paleontologists","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"paleontologists"},{"id":"5c2e20537e716b454591b07b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e20537e716b454591b07b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Creationism","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"creationism"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Creationism","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"creationism"},{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7ab75f002c8941e46e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Congress","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"congress"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Congress","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"congress"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b22d4972cd5b83355","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d4b22d4972cd5b83355","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ethics","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ethics"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Ethics","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"ethics"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News

The bidding, organized by a company called Heritage Auctions, began with two amethyst geodes that, when paired, resembled the ears of an alert rabbit. Then came meteorites, petrified wood, and elephant tusks; centipedes, scorpions, and spiders preserved in amber; rare quartzes, crystals, and fossils. The fossils ranged from small Eocene swimmers imprinted on rock to the remains of late-Cretaceous dinosaurs. That day, the articulated toe and claw of a Moroccan dinosaur sold for sixty-three hundred dollars. A tyrannosaur toothâten and a half inches from root to spikeâwent for nearly forty thousand.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong one wall, behind ropes, loomed the skeleton of a _Tarbosaurus bataar_. _T. bataar,_ as it is known, was a _Tyrannosaurus rex_ cousin that lived some seventy million years ago, in what is now the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. Eight feet tall and twenty-four feet long, the specimen had been mounted in a predatory running position, with its arms out and its jaws open, as if determined to eat Lot No. 49220âa cast Komodo dragon, crouching ten yards away, on blue velvet.\n\n\n\nAfter a German sea-lily fossil sold to a live bidder, for forty thousand dollars, Greg Rohan, Heritageâs president, who had been standing near the lectern, handed the auctioneer a note. The auctioneer announced, âThe sale of this next lot will be contingent upon a satisfactory resolution of a court proceeding.â He was talking about the dinosaur, which he called the auctionâs âsignature item.â Largely intact dinosaur skeletons are not easily found, and this specimen had been advertised as seventy-five per cent complete. âIt can fit in all rooms ten feet high,â the auctioneer added. âSo itâs also a great decorative piece.â\n\n\n\nAs the bidding opened, at eight hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars, Robert Painter, an attorney from Houston, stood up, a BlackBerry in his hand. Painter is six feet three and forty-two, with dark hair, rimless eyeglasses, and a deep voice. âI hate to interrupt this,â he told the room. âBut I have the judge on the phone.â The previous day, Carlos Cortezâa state district judge in Dallas, where Heritage has its headquartersâhad signed a temporary restraining order forbidding the company to auction the _T. bataar,_ on the ground that the dinosaur was believed to have been stolen from Mongolia. The judge, defied, was not pleased. \n\n\n\nThe auction had come to the attention of the Mongolian government the preceding Friday, after Bolortsetseg Minjin, a Mongolian paleontologist who lives in New York, saw a television report about the auction and suspected that the dinosaur had been taken from her country. Bolor, as she is called, discovered that the online auction catalogue listed the itemâs provenance as âCentral Asiaââa vague term often considered code for Mongolia and China, both of which forbid the commercial export of fossils found within their borders. Other catalogue items, such as the tyrannosaur tooth, openly referred to the Nemegt Formation, a fossil-rich expanse of sandstone and mudstone in the Mongolian Gobi. \n\n\n\nBolor e-mailed Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, an aide to President Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Mongolian dinosaur fossils had appeared on the black market for years, but there had been few, if any, organized efforts to stop their sale. Even though the Mongolians had only two days to intervene in the auction, they decided to try. Bolor enlisted two of the worldâs top experts in Mongolian dinosaursâMark Norell, the head of the American Museum of Natural Historyâs paleontology division, and Phil Currie, of the University of Albertaâwho wrote open letters of protest. Norell argued, âThese specimens are the patrimony of the Mongolian people and should be in a museum in Mongolia.â The letters were distributed to reporters. Online, paleontologists, geologists, students, and Mongolians signed a petition against the auction, adding comments: âFossils belong in museums where *EVERYONE*{: .small} can see and learn from them, not in some rich, fat douchebagâs mansion or in some Wall Street officeâ; âMongolian fossils are spectacular . . . selling them as mantelpieces is akin to using the Mona Lisa as a placemat.â \n\n\n\nBolor wrote to Heritage: Where had the _T. bataar_ come from? Did it possess provenance papers? Heritageâs attorney replied, âAlthough we appreciate your concerns . . . it is our conclusion that no impropriety exists.â He added, âMongolia won its independence in 1921 and this specimen is quite a bit older than that.â \n\n\n\nThe Mongolian government lawyered up, retaining Painter, the Houston attorney. He had experience representing Western mining interests in Mongolia, whose vast, untapped reserves of copper, gold, and coal are at the center of an international scramble. Like most lawyers, he had never handled a case involving a dinosaur, but he drafted the restraining order, got Judge Cortez to sign it, and boarded a plane for New York. \n\n\n\nAs Painter interrupted the auction, his BlackBerry aloft, the auctioneer eyed him but never broke patter. He called for a bid of nine hundred thousand dollars. \n\n\n\nRohan, Heritageâs president, met Painter in the aisle, and for five seconds they squared off in a quiet little dance, four arms waving. A security guard stepped in. Painter repeated that he had Judge Cortez on the phone. âO.K.âwell, you need to walk,â the guard said, escorting Painter to the rear of the auction floor. Outside, on the sidewalk, a small, pro-Mongolia protest had formed, with banners reading âNational Heritage Is Not for Saleâ and âReturn Our Stolen Treasure.â\n\n\n\nAn attorney for Heritage approached Painter, who handed him his BlackBerry. While the attorney was having an awkward discussion with Judge Cortez, the dinosaur sold to an anonymous phone bidder, for nearly a million dollars. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHeritage brokered the _T. bataar_ on behalf of a thirty-seven-year-old bone hunter named Eric Prokopi, who lives in Florida, a great state for fossils. For roughly the first half of the past fifty million years, the region lay beneath a warm, shallow sea. As land repeatedly surfaced and receded, the remains of marine creatures got mixed up with those of terrestrials, forming one big Ice Age graveyard: sea cows, prehistoric sharks, spike-tailed armadillos the size of refrigerators. \n\n\n\n\n\nShark teeth attract kids to fossil hunting because theyâre so easy to find. Sharks shed thousands of teeth per year, and have been doing so for eons. The teeth, exposed by erosion and tides, can be as big as a human hand. The largest look like the arrowheads of giants, and can sell for thousands of dollars. \n\n\n\nProkopi, who grew up outside Tampa, is the son of a music teacher and a homemaker. He found his first shark tooth as a small boy, in the late seventies, at nearby Venice Beach. By age ten, he had a diving license. His mother, a competitive swimmer, accompanied him on river expeditions. As he explored underwater, holding a rope, she rode in a canoe, tugging the line if she saw an alligator. \n\n\n\nThrough fossil clubs and field trips to quarries, Prokopi got to know older hunters who spent their lives beachcombing or standing chest deep in muck, searching for bone. Paleontology books explained what heâd found and taught him what to look for next. When he was in high school, fossils began to take over the familyâs house, and around 1990 he started selling them, making eight hundred dollars at his first trade show, in Lakeland. At such events, he bartered with other hunters, who often brought entire trailers filled with specimens. Some fossils were still sheathed in âfield jacketsââthe lumpy white plaster encasements that excavators apply at dig sites, for safe transport, making the artifacts look like misshapen mummies. \n\n\n\nAlthough some countries had fossil-trade restrictions, or were enacting them, certain dealers proceeded as though there were no rules; they justified their trade, in part, with the idea that exposed fossils, if not collected, disintegrate. Prokopi quickly learned that, when he found something good, someone would buy it. If the business sometimes resembled a black market, it was a small one: nobody seriously imagined getting rich digging up prehistoric bones. \n\n\n\nThen, the day before Prokopi turned sixteen, a magnificent _T. rex_ was found weathering out of a cliff near Faith, South Dakota. An amber hunter named Sue Hendrickson, working with the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, a company that collects and prepares fossils, had wandered off to explore a bluff as her crew changed a flat tire, and came back with a handful of dinosaur. The team named the _T. rex_ Sue.\n\n\n\nA legal fight followed, centering on the Sioux rancher who, for five thousand dollars, had sold Black Hills the right to dig out the dinosaur but whose land, part of an Indian reservation, was being held in federal trust. As the case unfolded in the courts, the movie âJurassic Park_â_ came out, rebooting dinosaurs in the popular imagination. The rancher eventually won the right to sell Tyrannosaurus Sue. On October 4, 1997, Sothebyâs, in New York, auctioned the fossil; Chicagoâs Field Museum of Natural History bought it, with sponsorship from Disney and McDonaldâs, for an unprecedented $8.4 million. \n\n\n\nHendrickson had found her _T. rex_ the way hunters have always found fossils: by walking around and looking down. In America, the most spectacular dinosaur discoveries have been made in the West, in a swath of exposures from the Canadian border to New Mexico. During the infamous nineteenth-century âbone wars,â between the East Coast paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and O. C. Marsh, scientists encountered dinosaur skeletons âexposed like corpses on a deserted battlefield,â Michael Novacek writes in âDinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs.â \n\n\n\nToday in the United States, only approved researchers may collect vertebrates on public land, but a hunter who finds a fossil on his property, or on private land where he has permission to dig, can sell it, exhibit it, export itâwhatever. After the sale of Tyrannosaurus Sue, a modern gold rush began, and it has not let up. In the summers, the Western snows have barely receded before prospectors arrive, often with private clients who pay to hunt with guides. \n\n\n\nRanchers who had once allowed scientists to explore their land for free began leasing it to the highest bidder. Paleontologists lost out to amateurs with more money, and they lost specimens to vandals and thieves, some of whom went after fossils with sledgehammers. Federal agents have tracked stolen American dinosaurs as far away as Japan. The paleontologist Kirk Johnson, the director of the Smithsonianâs National Museum of Natural History, says, âThe day Sue got auctioned is the day fossils became money.â \n\n+++feature-small\n\n[#image: /photos/590966002179605b11ad61e4]|||\n\n The T. bataar, in Prokopiâs workshop, before it was auctioned in New York.\n\n|||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nProkopi continued selling fossils through high school and college. He won an academic scholarship to the University of Florida, in Gainesville, where he joined the swim team and earned a degree in engineering, a subject that interested him only insofar as it illuminated the mechanics of, say, how to level a structural foundation or gut-renovate a house. After graduation, he stayed in Gainesville and started his life as a full-time fossil hunter, calling himself a âcommercial paleontologist.â He named his company Florida Fossils. \n\n\n\n\n\nAt twenty-eight, he married a SeaWorld dolphin trainer named Amanda Grahamâa native Virginian he met through their shared love of diving. For extra income, they âflippedâ houses near the college campus. Amanda started an interior-decorating business that sometimes showcased natural-history objects, featuring Ericâs finds and other fossils that they had imported or come across at the two big U.S. trade shows, in Tucson and Denver. They also began using eBay, which allowed merchandise to be moved faster, and, if the participants so chose, with greater anonymity. \n\n\n\nIf you were mapping the geographic evolution of Prokopiâs inventory, youâd pin Florida to start, then move on to Alabama, Texas, China, Japan, Peru, Morocco, Argentina, Kazakhstan, and elsewhere. He sold sloth claws, elephant jaws, wolf molars, dinosaur ribsâa wide range of anatomical fragments that went, mostly, for between ten and fifty dollars. Increasingly, Florida Fossils got into triple digits, especially when Prokopi started selling dinosaur parts. In the fall of 2011, he sold two Mongolian oviraptor nests for more than three hundred and fifty dollars each, a tyrannosaurus ileum for five hundred and sixty-one dollars, a tyrannosaurus tooth for three hundred and twenty-five dollars, and a tyrannosaurus tail vertebra for four hundred and ten dollars. He built up a 99.7-per-cent-positive rating with eBay customers, who praised his wares as âunusualâ and âexquisite.â\n\n\n\nBy 2010, the Prokopis had a toddler son, Grey, and an infant daughter, Rivers, to support. It was no longer enough to peddle a bone here, a bone there, even as Prokopi supplemented his income by âprepping outâ fossilsâcleaning and restoring themâand selling the results to small museums and nature centers. His best shot at big money was dinosaurs. The top sites in the American West were largely tied up in federal boundaries and, on the private side, in existing contracts that usually required sizable cuts to ranchers. Only one place on Earth holds big, beautiful _T. rex_-like dinosaurs in relatively soft sand, in a vast, remote landscape that all but insures privacy. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMongolia, which is more than twice the size of Texas, borders Russia to the north and China everywhere else. Thirty per cent of Mongoliaâs three million people live in or around the capital, Ulaanbaatar, and, despite flashes of new-economy wealth (Hummers, a Louis Vuitton shop), much of the nation subsists in poverty. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gobi Desert cuts across southern Mongolia and extends into northern China. The primary locus of dinosaur hunting is the Nemegt Formation. Phil Currie, the Canadian paleontologist, says, âRight now, the Nemegt represents one of the top two dinosaur sites in the world, in terms of diversity of specimens.â\n\n\n\n_T. bataar,_ a carnivorous, bipedal dinosaur, lived around seventy million years ago; Russian and Mongolian scientists discovered it in 1946, during an expedition to the Nemegt. The species closely resembles _T. rex_, which lived at the same time but has been found only in North America. Both had long tails to counterbalance large skulls, and, proportionally, they had the smallest forelimbs of any apex predator. _T. bataar_ was slightly smaller than _T. rex_, which is like drawing a distinction between a city bus and a school bus: the largest known _T. bataar_ stood ten feet high, was up to forty feet long, and had nearly six dozen huge, spiky teeth, with jaws of crushing torque. _T. bataar_ fed on other dinosaursâbig ones. \n\n\n\nWe know this because of the fossil record, which exists thanks to all types of hunters but is vetted by scientists, many of whom loathe the sale of fossils but donât necessarily want to discourage the popular fascination with them, either. âGreat ones have yet to be found, so we _want_ people looking for them,â Johnson, the Smithsonian director, says. âBut we want a path for the really important ones to loop into science. Right now, that path doesnât exist. Plenty of collectors say, âYouâre more than welcome to come to my house and study my fossils.â But itâs an empty promise. Even if they let you look at something, if they sell it, it might as well not exist.â \n\n\n\nUnlike the U.S., most other nations with rich dinosaur depositsâincluding Argentina, Canada, and Chinaâconsider fossils part of their national heritage and oppose or restrict their entry into the private market. Mongolia outlawed the trade in 1924, but bone runners have always operated from the Gobi, because they have found outsiders willing to buy fossils. âThe Gobiâs getting hammered,â Mark Norell told me in July, just before leaving for Mongolia. He helped reopen the Gobi to Westerners after Communist rule ended, in the early nineteen-nineties, and since then has dug there at least twenty-two times. âMy sites in Mongolia have been clobbered by these slimeballs,â he said of poachers, adding, âPeople follow you. Thereâs nomads living out there. Youâll see guys on motorcycles, and guys a kilometre away, looking at you through binoculars.â \n\n\n\nCurrie, who has worked in Mongolia since 1996, recognizes poached sites by their trash: cigarette wrappers, vodka bottles, junked cars, Super Glue bottles, graffiti. Poachers often mark their sites by carving the date on rocks, and they frequently leave Mongolian money tucked beneath stonesâalms to the gods. \n\n\n\nMany poachers take teeth and claws first, because theyâre the easiest to transport. Other thieves hack their way up the vertebral column in pursuit of the skull, the most prized body part. A fossil that has been separated from its geological contextâsuch as location and stratigraphic position, which poachers do not documentâbecomes far less significant to science.\n\n\n\nOnce a smuggler gets fossils out of the country, the shipment need only make it past customs. Smugglers donât always succeed. A few years ago in Chicago, agents X-rayed an express-mail shipment of âshoes,â with a declared value of fifty dollars, that turned out to be the skulls of Chinese dinosaurs. In Los Angeles, agents seized the fossil of a Chinese oviraptor nest after it sold, via the English auction house Bonhams & Butterfields, for more than four hundred thousand dollars. (The buyer cancelled his bid.) The nest had been advertised as featuring visible, preserved embryos, but it actually was a composite: the seller had bought the eggs separately, then implanted them in a slab of imported red sandstone. In late 2011, the U.S. repatriated the eggs. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe _T. bataar_ skull entered the country, amid other fossils, via U.P.S., on March 27, 2010. By then, Prokopi had established a business arrangement with Chris Moore, a hunter on the famed Jurassic Coast of England and a well-known dealer at the Tucson and Denver shows. Moore had shipped these component fossils to Prokopi in three crates weighing nearly three thousand pounds. The customs forms listed the shipmentâs country of origin as Great Britain, its over-all value as fifteen thousand dollars, and, on an invoice, its contents as â2 large rough (unprepared) fossil reptile heads, 6 boxes of broken fossil bones, 3 rough (unprepared) fossil reptiles, 1 fossil lizard, 3 rough (unprepared) fossil reptiles,â and â1 fossil reptile skull.â Customs sent it on through.\n\n\n\n\n\nProkopi spent the next year and a half cleaning the _T. bataar_ fossils, gluing them together, fabricating bones out of resin to replace missing pieces (an accepted practice, even in museums), and building a custom-welded frame. For years, the Prokopis had prepped fossils on their kitchen floor and in their garage, but in May, 2011, they built a five-thousand-square-foot workshop in their back yard, and they assembled the _T. bataar_ there. In early 2012, they laid the bones in formation on the workshop floor and shot a photograph from overhead: a large dinosaur curled in a loose fetal position, with Eric kneeling beside it, hands on hips, smiling up at the camera. The photograph was posted on the Facebook page of Amandaâs home-design business, Everything Earth (âWhere nature is artâ); prospective buyers were urged to e-mail for more information. \n\n\n\nIn February, Prokopi took the _T. bataar_ to the Tucson show and displayed the legs and skull, along with the photograph of the full skeleton on the workshop floor. When the dinosaur failed to sell, he turned to auction houses that handled natural-history specimens. He had relationships with I. M. Chait, Heritage, Sothebyâs, and Bonhams. At least one house rejected the _T. bataar_, but Heritage took it. To make the spring-auction deadline, Prokopi stayed up for ninety hours straight to finish the prep work and the mounting. The specimen was shipped to Texas, to be photographed for the Heritage catalogue, and then to New York. \n\n\n\nOther Prokopi projects, meanwhile, were acquired for other auctions. A saurolophus, a duck-billed dinosaur that, like _T. bataar_, has been found only in Mongolia, went to I. M. Chait, in Beverly Hills, with a listed provenance of Central Asia. The catalogue copy noted, âTo this day, barely more than 10 skulls are known, and this is one of only a handful of complete skeletons ever found or mounted.â The estimated gavel price was between a hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand dollars. The saurolophus didnât sell. Two weeks later, the _T. bataar_ sold to the anonymous phone bidder. \n\n\n\nThe Mongolians began preparing for a courtroom battle. Commercial hunters, meanwhile, couldnât believe that anyone had so openly tried to sell a major Mongolian dinosaur. At the Denver fossil show, in September, I stopped by the booth of Mike Triebold, a veteran Colorado hunter who has been working with the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists to find a way for academics and legitimate commercial hunters to collaborate. âIâve got about thirty employees and millions of dollars invested in my business,â he said. âThe last thing Iâm gonna do is bring in an illegal fossil.â\n\n\n\nBob Detrich, another hunter, was at Trieboldâs booth, and he said, âMy first question when I saw it in the catalogue was âHow is this even possible?â â \n\n\n\nTriebold noted that Mongolian dinosaur bones had been on the market for years, but added, âItâs been up to and including skulls. Thereâs never been a big, whole _T. rex_-y skeleton. This is a big, sexy dinosaur. Itâs so over the top that somebody finally said, âAll right, wait a minute. You guys gotta stop this.â â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe price of the _T. bataar,_ with Heritageâs premium, came to $1,052,500. The transaction was put on hold until the provenance could be worked out. Dismantled and crated, the fossil was trucked to the Cadogan Tate Fine Art storage facility, in Sunnyside, Queens. President Elbegdorj, meanwhile, formally asked the United States to investigate. The Americansâmindful, perhaps, of staying in the good graces of a country poised to become a mining giantâgranted Mongoliaâs request.\n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5f6b57b86d47b169c2e7]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\nAlthough Heritage continued to defend the sale, it coÃ¶perated with the investigation by allowing a team of paleontologists to assess the dinosaur. On the morning of June 5th, three scientists met at the warehouse in Queens: Bolor Minjin, Phil Currie, and Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar, of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, in Ulaanbaatar. The scientists found more than two hundred bones in open crates or laid out neatly on tables, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. \n\n\n\nIt was something of a miracle that the dinosaur existed at all. Nature heavily skews the odds against an animal becoming a fossilâmost simply decompose. But this _T. bataar_ had somehow been buried quickly in sediment, which then turned into rock. Fossils absorb ground minerals specific to their location, giving them a geochemical signature. Mongolian dinosaurs are slightly radioactive, owing to the presence of uranium in the Gobi; the bones, which have a distinctive off-white color, resemble those of the freshly dead. \n\n\n\nDozens of _T. bataar_ skeletons have been exhumed, but thereâs still much to learn about the species and how it lived. Why, for instance, was _T. bataar_ so tremendously overrepresented in the Gobi? âIt makes no sense,â Currie says. âYou canât have an ecosystem where there are more carnivores than herbivores.â And there are anatomical mysteries: just what evolutionary purpose did those tiny arms serve?\n\n\n\nPaleontologists usually handle fossils bare-handed, but at the warehouse the scientists were given purple synthetic gloves to wear as they worked. Currie and the others spent the day examining the _T. bataar_, piece by piece, comparing the bonesâ size, color, and condition with what they knew about the species from other fossils. They determined that seventy-five per cent of the dinosaur was composed of original bone, as advertised. The creature was two-thirds grown. The ivory coloration matched that of other Nemegt fossils. The scientists concurred: the dinosaur was Mongolian. \n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York sued for custody of the specimen, on behalf of the nation of Mongolia. Procedure required that an arrest warrant be issued against the dinosaur itself, so the action became known as United States of America v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skeleton. \n\n\n\nOn June 22nd, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent a cargo truck to the warehouse in Queens and confiscated the dinosaur. As Bolor Minjin, Robert Painter, and the rest of the Mongolia contingent watched, elated, from behind a chain-link fence, Homeland Security Investigations agents loaded four large crates onto the truck. They then took the bones to an undisclosed location. \n\n\n\nProkopi hired a pair of attorneys who have represented dealers of contested antiquities: Michael McCullough, in New York, and Peter Tompa, in Washington. Prokopi had sixty days to decide whether to surrender the dinosaur or make a legal claim for it. If the deal went through, he stood to make about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, after the other parties took their share, and he was clearly reluctant to give this up. Indeed, Prokopi had entertained the idea of brokering a quiet deal with the Mongolians. Four days after the auction, in an e-mail conversation with a Heritage employee, he wrote, âAlthough I am sure that everything with this specimen is legal as far back as I can tell, I do know just about all of the people involved in the business of central asian fossils, and could offer ideas and help to make permanent changes that would nearly eliminate the black market and benefit all sides. If the mongolian president is indeed only interested in getting to the bottom of the sources, and wants to look good for his people, I think I can help him do that if he is willing to cooperate and compromise. If he only wants to take the skeleton and try to put an end to the black market, he will have a fight and will only drive the black market deeper underground.â \n\n\n\nPublicly, Prokopi said nothing about how he had acquired the dinosaur, or how it had wound up in England before coming to the U.S. He insisted that he was not a thief. âIâm just a guy . . . trying to support my familyânot some international bone smuggler,â he said, in his sole statement to the media. âIf I believed it wasnât legal for me to have or sell this dinosaur, why would I have offered it in such a public format? The lost sale of this dinosaur has irreparably devastated my family financially, it has cost several people their jobs, taken an emotional toll on my wife and two young children and damaged my reputation as a commercial paleontologist. . . . What will we tell our kids? How will we keep going? Iâm headed toward total financial ruin.â \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn Gainesville, the Prokopis live in a historic, plantation-style house called Serenola. Built in 1935, it is white clapboard, with black shutters and four Corinthian columns. The Prokopis got the house for free six years ago, as a derelict property; it was in such bad repair, and so full of filth and feces, that when Amanda first toured it she had to step outside to vomit. But the Prokopis saw money in it. They loaded the house onto flatbeds and moved it a mile down the road to nine acres that they owned, and then restored it themselves, foundation to roof, adding a Viking stove and a fifty-thousand-gallon saltwater pool. They wound up with a showplace and decided to keep it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe met there one Wednesday in August. The property faced a four-lane highway, but Serenola was tucked behind a brick wall and a modest electric gate. The surrounding marsh, shrieking cicadas, and Spanish mossâhanging like frayed gray scarves, not a breeze to stir itâmade the property feel almost secluded. Clouds that had blackened a far quadrant of the sky pulsed with lightning. \n\n\n\nThe Prokopis answered the door together. Amanda, a shiny-haired blonde, wore black from head to toe, her wrists roped in silver bracelets. Eric, who is tall, dark-haired, and deeply tanned, with a swimmerâs shoulders, was dressed casuallyâpolo shirt, camouflage cargo shorts, and flip-flops. He said little, which, Amanda explained, was typical. Once, during a dive trip to Mexico, someone asked Eric what he did for a living. When he said, âI sell fossils,â the person answered, âYou sell faucets?â and proceeded to talk about faucets. Prokopi let it go. âI have to pull things out of him sometimes,â Amanda told me.\n\n\n\nTheir two children, both towheads, came downstairs. Their son, who is five, led everyone to the family room, opened the deep drawers of a reproduction Colonial bureau, and showed off his toysâdinosaurs, jumbled together, snout upon tail, in a plastic mass grave. âGuess what this one is,â he said several times, blurting out the species. How do you know all the names? I asked. âBecause Iâm a scientist,â he said.\n\n\n\nWe sat at the dining-room table, which the Prokopis had made from the slats of champagne barrels. The house was filled with vintage objects: repurposed corbels and bricks, bone-white corals alongside mercury glass. Amanda adheres to a decorating principle of âbig mirrors, lots of lamps, and something sparklyâ in every room. âGlobal Chic Meets Plantation Elegance,â the Gainesville _Sun_ put it, in a 2010 article about Serenola. (Eric âlikes to do lapsâ in the Olympic-size pool, the paper reported, âwhen heâs not diving Floridaâs rivers or setting off on business trips to Bali or Mongolia.â) \n\n\n\nAbout three weeks before my visit, Prokopi had made an official claim for the _T. bataar_. To win the case, he would have to prove legal ownership. Although people in paleontology circles had been speculating about how the fossil had been taken out of MongoliaâI had been hearing that some fossils crossed the border hidden inside shipments of coalâProkopi declined, on the advice of his attorneys, to discuss specifics. He told me that he had gone into the fossil business because he was drawn to âthe treasure-hunting mentalityâ and to âthe thrill.â He added, âI used to keep everything. Now I donât keep anything. I enjoy having it for a time and then move on.â\n\n\n\nSo far, no evidence had emerged proving that Prokopi had spent time in Mongolia digging for the _T. bataar_ or other dinosaurs, although his eBay account featured more than a hundred items from the country, and he had sold higher-end Gobi pieces at auction. His connection to Mongolia had âstarted with Tucson,â he said, referring to the trade fair, which takes place every February. âAnd thatâs probably as far as I can go with that right now.â \n\n\n\nAmanda genially jumped in: âPeople come around at the shows and want to trade for stuff, just like baseball cards. So your inventory evolves that way.â \n\n\n\nâThereâs always a lot of unprepared stuff available,â Eric said. âI was getting better at mounting specimens and doing big projects, and thatâs where a lot of the money is. When you buy it, itâs not necessarily worth that much. Itâs the work that you put into it that creates the value.â \n\n\n\nâItâs like the paint in the âMona Lisa,â â Amanda said. âItâs really the same thing.â She then compared fossil preparation to renovating houses. The _T. bataar_ looked âawesome now, but it took years. And it took being up all night and being broke all the time to get to this point.â \n\n\n\nA major fossil is âa good investment,â Eric said. âYou can get a good return in the end, and itâs interesting and fun.â But when âyouâre struggling to make the sale, and then it doesnât happen when youâre expecting it, itâs difficult.â \n\n\n\nâItâs like rebuilding a house and watching it burn down,â Amanda said.\n\n\n\nâRenovating a house and putting tons of money into it, and the government coming and seizing it before you can sell it,â Eric said.\n\n\n\nThey offered a tour of the property. In the back yard, where the _T. bataar_ had been assembled, the workshop bays stood open. Huge industrial fans rearranged the soupy air. An employee, a University of Florida archeology student, was using a pneumatic tool to clean a chunk of Wyoming stegosaurus. There were boxes full of bone fragments and dim old bottles fished from rivers, and a flat-bottomed military boat that, Eric said, âdoesnât get used much anymore.â \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5f6cba20a654ac5d44b4]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\nInside the house was a tall antique case that, according to Amanda, once displayed wedding gowns at Sears. It now held an ankylosaurid skull and other fossils. âMostly casts,â Eric said. Brilliant corals were arranged in glass-fronted cabinets, in the manner of an apothecary shop. âThis is all inventory,â Amanda said. âThese are from all around the world.â On an end table was a tortoiseshell with an elaborate pattern. âThis is what?â Amanda asked Eric. âA radiated tortoise?â The radiated tortoise is most commonly found in Madagascar, I subsequently discovered, and is an endangered species. (Prokopi later told me that heâd bought his from someone who works at an American zoo, but he declined to elaborate.)\n\n\n\nâThe stuff in our house evolves all the time,â Eric said. \n\n\n\nUpstairs, in one of the childrenâs rooms, was the framed auction photo of a tyrannosaurus skull, dated March, 2007. The skull closely resembled that of _T. bataar_, but Amanda didnât want to talk about it, except to say that their son was conceived on the weekend of that auction. âWe were celebrating,â she said. (I. M. Chait sold a _T. bataar_ skull that month, to a private collector, for nearly three hundred thousand dollars.)\n\n\n\nA while later, after a walk in a nearby nature preserve, we were back at the champagne-barrel table. Eric asked a surprising question: âOne thing I was wondering is if any of these paleontologists youâve talked to have given their argument of why paleontology is important.â Fossils are âjust basically rocks,â he said. âItâs not like antiquities, where itâs somebodyâs heritage and culture and all that.â \n\n\n\nAmanda changed the subject to a television program she had liked, on the Discovery Channel, about whether mermaids exist. But Eric persisted. âWhere do you draw the line?â he said. âI donât think it can ever be black and white. You canât legislate every single species or fossil.â He had been twisting a scrap of paper and shoving it through the slats of the table. Amanda took it away from him. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHeritage Auctions was founded in Dallas, in 1976, by a pair of rare-coin dealers. With satellite offices in Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Manhattan, and Europe, Heritage bills itself as the worldâs largest collectibles auctioneer, and over the decades it has branched into comics, movie posters, jewelry, books, fine art, and wine, among other things. Last year, the company sold more than eight hundred million dollarsâ worth of items. \n\n\n\n\n\nHeritage got online early, in 1996. Rohan, its president, told me, âWe thought, Oh, the Internet: interesting. We donât think anybody will ever do any real business on it, but maybe we should spend a couple million dollars and build a whammy-jammy Web site and load it full of content for coin collectors.â That venture led to online auctions, which coincided with the explosive popularity of eBay. Rohan said that eBay âdid for auctions what Fidelity did for stocksâtook it down to the Everyman.â\n\n\n\nRohan was telling me this in late July, in a parlor of a Southampton bed-and-breakfast where he was vacationing with his wife. He had bumped into Matt Rubinger, who heads Heritageâs luxury-accessories division, and brought him along to our meeting. Rohan is fifty-one, lean, and six feet one; in khakis, a navy Izod, blue leather loafers, and a canvas belt embroidered with sailboats, he appeared ready to tack. Rubinger, twenty-four, had a Gatsby look: a summer suit with a white, open-collared shirt. I asked him what his clients collect. Rohan answered for him: âTwo-hundred-thousand-dollar handbags.â Rubinger added that vintage HermÃ¨s bags were the most popular items. âItâs a new, new market,â he said.\n\n\n\nNatural history accounts for âvery littleâ of Heritageâs sales, Rohan told me. Still, the _T. bataar_ deal would have yielded a six-figure commission. Heritage was now âout of it,â in any case. âIt really is an issue between the consigner and Mongolia,â Rohan said. âWeâve extricated ourselves.â \n\n\n\nIt had been that easy. Black-market fossils have regularly been sold through some of the worldâs finest auction houses, but auctioneers, including eBay, have not been held accountable for their role. When I asked Rohan why Heritage had accepted the _T. bataar_, he said, âBecause the person who consigned it had a good reputation over decades, and because he warrantied, in writing, that he had clear title. It was his to do with as he saw fit.â Did he have any regrets? âItâs annoying that I had to spend a lot of money on legal fees, dealing with the issue,â he said. A few minutes later, he thought of one more thing: Mongoliaâs interference had scared away buyers. Without the controversy, he said, the dinosaur âwouldâve brought a much, much higher price.â\n\n\n\nThe head of Heritageâs natural-history division was David Herskowitz, a well-known broker in the mineral and fossil world. In 2011, I called Herskowitz about a Dallas auction that featured a âfighting pairâ of Jurassic dinosaurs from Wyoming. When I asked him how natural-history objects had entered the American fine-arts auction market, Herskowitz credited himself. âIt all started by chance,â he said. âI was importing and exporting gemstones, going down to South America and buying emeralds, when the Soviet Union fell apart and we had a free market. I heard there were good gemstones to be had in Russia, so I went there and bought topaz and emeralds and amber.â An appraiser in New York helped him grade the stones, one of which encased a prehistoric fly. âI said, âHow could a fly get inside a gemstone?â I didnât realize amber was actually fossilized tree resin. The appraiser said, âSome people actually collect this.â â A jeweller sold the amber on Herskowitzâs behalf, for three hundred and twenty-five dollars. âAnd I thought, O.K., wow, Iâm gonna load up the truck.â He returned to Russia and paid a hundred and seventy-five dollars for a load of amber pieces with insects embedded in them. Bonhams later sold the amber, he said, for more than seven thousand dollars. âFossils are perfect for auction because auctions are there for treasures and things you donât see in a store every day,â he told me. âIf youâre a fossil collector, where are you gonna buy your fossils? If you find a _T. rex_, where are you gonna sell it?â\n\n\n\nMuseums feed the market, up to a point. Established institutions discriminate among sources when acquiring fossils, but newer ones sometimes donât. Natural-history museums that are popping up in China, Japan, and the Middle East have been accused of being willing to buy from anyone. They want dinosaurs and mammals, Herskowitz told me, while individual collectors prefer smaller pieces. âNot many people have a house big enough for a dinosaur,â he explained. âThe most popular stuff is the stuff you can put on your shelf, like meteorites, trilobites, dinosaur eggs, and dinosaur bones. Like a nice vertebraâyou can put it on your shelf and say, âLook, thatâs a _T. rex_ vertebra.â â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe man who was prepared to pay more than a million dollars for the _T. bataar_ is Coleman Burke, a Manhattan real-estate developer and lawyer in his seventies. His friends call him Coley. He is tall and trim, with wispy white hair, and on the day we met (reluctantly, on his partâhis bid, after all, had been anonymous) he had on khakis, Topsiders, a checked shirt, and a brown leather belt studded with silver fish. It was late August, and he had recently returned from the midsummer encampment of the Bohemian Club, in California; he was now getting ready to go fly-fishing in Idahoâa trip that he and friends have taken annually for the past forty-five years. Burke mentioned his service on various environmental boards and his role as a trustee of the natural-history museum at Yale, his alma mater, but he kept returning to the topics of geology and rivers. âIâve been going down rivers all my life,â he said. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, he and a five-member crew rafted down the Santa Cruz River, in Patagonia, inspired by a journey that Charles Darwin had tried to make in 1834. Had Darwin not turned back, he might have reached Argentinaâs spectacular bone beds, a sight that captivated Burke. During the Santa Cruz trip, and others to Patagonia and the American West, Burkeâs interest in dinosaur fossils intensified. He began hunting fossils and funding expeditions, to the extent that his friends kidded him about it. Six years ago, at a party for his twenty-fifth wedding anniversary (theme: âJoy and Mischiefâ), a tuxedoed pianist jokingly serenaded him about dinosaurs, with lyrics set to the tune of âPuff, the Magic Dragon.â Burke told me, âPeople say, âHowâs the archeology going?,â and I say, âOh, thatâs not my bag.â If itâs not a hundred million years old, I donât do it. I call it the ultimate antiquing.â\n\n\n\nBurkeâs company, Waterfront New York, occupies a city block at Twelfth Avenue and West Twenty-eighth Street. An operator-run elevator cage delivered me to the seventh floor, and then Burke and I climbed a tight spiral staircase to a window-walled office reminiscent of a crowâs nest, with views of the Hudson and New Jersey, where Burke grew up. On the observation deck was a tarp-covered signal light, which Burke, an ex-Navy lieutenant, likes to flash at passing ships. His walls held framed photos of Western badlands, vintage maps of South America, and an Explorers Club membership certificate. A _Giganotosaurus carolinii_ skullâa cast, he quickly pointed outâoccupied half the eastern wall, dwarfing an upright piano that he often plays. \n\n\n\nâIâm a complete amateur,â he kept saying, but his fossil hobby has not been fruitless. A decade ago in Argentina, a Burke crew found a new dinosaur species that is now considered one of the southernmost carnivores on record. The creature was named _Orkoraptor burkei_, in his honor. A few years later, the Explorers Club honored him and a Drexel University geologist for finding, also in Argentina, the largest dinosaur femur ever discovered. \n\n\n\nBurke, for all his hunting, has never owned a major fossil. âIâve got a couple of bones lying around, but nothing big,â he told me. In May, he saw a newspaper item about the upcoming _T. bataar_ auction. He went to the preview, and the moment he saw the dinosaur he wanted to buy it. Maybe the _T. bataar_ could be displayed on the ground floor of his companyâs headquarters; later, perhaps, it could be in a museum. He did not notice where the specimen was from, he told me. âCouldâve been the jungles of Sarawak,â he said. âI wasnât focussed on that at all. It was a well-prepared specimen. They said it was seventy-five to eighty per cent complete.â He added, âI can assure you, Iâd have called in some experts long before I parted with one thin dime, to go down there and check each bone, and make sure I could get to seventy-five or eighty per cent.â \n\n\n\nOn the day of the auction, Burke bid by phone from his house in Westchester County; to his surprise, he won. âIt was a lark,â he said. He has since withdrawn his bid. \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5f6e3adc75471b34b235]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nUnited States of America v. One Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skeleton went to court in early September, in lower Manhattan, with U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel presiding. Castel has adjudicated cases involving accused mobsters (John Gotti, Jr.) and cases involving rappers (Kanye West) but never one with a party from the late Cretaceous. âI stand to be educated,â he said. âIâm not going to claim that I have dinosaur arrests presented to me with any frequency.â\n\n\n\n\n\nProkopi was not present. The purpose of the hearing was to set deadlines for determining whether the case would go to trial, and it went on for about an hour. Castel wanted to know who Prokopi was. A commercial paleontologist, one of Prokopiâs attorneys answered, adding, âHe collects fossils and he builds dinosaurs out of them.â\n\n\n\nâHow did he acquire it?â the judge said, meaning the _T. bataar_.\n\n\n\nâHe purchased it,â the attorney said. \n\n\n\nâWhere did he purchase it?â\n\n\n\nMultiple sources. \n\n\n\nâWhat sources?â \n\n\n\nâFrom dealers who sell dinosaur parts.â\n\n\n\nâWhere are they located?â\n\n\n\nâSome of them are in Japan, I believe,â the attorney said. âI donât know where all of them are.â\n\n\n\nProkopiâs team had claimed that the _T. bataar_ had come into the country in three separate shipments. Now they were saying fourâand that the specimen had been assembled from the bones of a number of dinosaurs. \n\n\n\nâYouâre telling me that what was being auctioned did not come from one once-upon-a-time living creature?â the judge said at one point.\n\n\n\nâThatâs exactly what Iâm saying,â the attorney said. The dinosaur was soon being referred to as a âFrankenstein model.â\n\n\n\nThe prosecutors, who had said that they were âloath to takeâ Prokopiâs word on anything at this point, informed the judge that a team of paleontologists had examined the bones and concluded that they had derived mostly from one creature. But this didnât matter much, anyway, since all the bones in question were certainly _T. bataar_ and, therefore, certainly Mongolian. \n\n\n\nIsnât it possible, the judge had asked, that _T. bataar_ lived elsewhere on Earth? Arenât scientific discoveries made all the time? \n\n\n\nOne of the assistant U.S. attorneys, Martin Bell, assured Castel that the scientific evidence all but confirmed that the bones were Mongolian. \n\n\n\nAt one point, the judge asked, âAny idea how large this dinosaur is, when fully assembled?â \n\n\n\nAbout twenty-four feet long and eight feet high, Bell answered. \n\n\n\nâSo it would fit nicely in my courtroom,â the judge said.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nA few weeks later, at the annual fossil show in Denver, everybody was talking about the _T. bataar_ case. Dealers were hoping that the drama wouldnât lead to new legislation making all U.S. fossils off-limits to commercial hunters. Paleontologists, meanwhile, hoped for stronger, clearer regulations or formalized collaboration between scientists and dealers. Johnson, the Smithsonian director, was attending the fair, and over breakfast he told me, âThe commercial guys range from people who couldnât give a shit about what theyâre selling and the people who really wouldâve been scientists if theyâd had a good education.â \n\n\n\n\n\nWe went over to the Merchandise Mart, the showâs main venue. Johnson has always kept amicable relationships with both the academic and the commercial side of the fossil world, and he wanted to stop by the booths of friends. Though shady deals have been known to go down in back rooms or parking lots, I wanted to see if anyone was openly selling dinosaur fossils from countries that forbid their export. \n\n\n\nOn one dealerâs table lay three raptors from China. Bones and beaks and claws were folded in red and brown sandstone, as in a bas-relief. One was priced at twelve thousand dollars, the two others at twenty-five thousand apiece. The dealer said that he had collected them ten years ago, when it was legal. (âClassic answer,â Johnson said.) At another booth, we saw fossilized pinecones from Argentina. (âThose have always been illegal.â) At another: sabre-toothed-cat skulls. (âChinese.â) The legal and the illicit were all jumbled together. Johnson compared the situation to finding marijuana nestled among parsley and cilantro at the grocery store. âThatâs the caveat-emptor part that I donât like,â he said. âWhatâs colliding here is the potential for kids to get excited about science and the weird spectre of some of this stuff being tainted.â\n\n\n\nI stopped at a booth selling Chinese and Mongolian fossils and casts, and asked the dealer how he got them. âAs long as you go through the proper channels, youâre fine,â he said. âGrease the right politiciansâ palms and stuff comes out. You gotta pay off the right guys.â \n\n\n\nOverhearing this, a woman browsing at his table said, âI know all about thatâIâm from New Jersey.â\n\n\n\nAs I browsed at the booth of a man selling fossils that had been quarried in Germany, I overheard him say that someone âwho works about fourteen hours a day might, once in his lifetime, find something.â Some quarry owners, he went on, âdonât pay well. If a worker finds something, he can get ten times more on the black market.â \n\n\n\nChris Moore, who had shipped Prokopi the _T. bataar_ fossils, was listed in the showâs directory as a vender. But Moore didnât show up. He was digging fossil fish in Scotland, an associate of his told me, and had âhit big.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe Prokopis are not fond of New YorkââWe donât get it,â Amanda saysâbut on the day that the paleontological team inspected the _T. bataar_ Eric flew there to unpack and repack the bones, rather than entrust the job to others. He and some of the Mongolians happened to be staying at the same La Quinta Inn, in Queens. The Mongolians didnât know what Prokopi looked like, but, when one of them overheard a man in the hotel lobby talking on his cell phone about a dinosaur, he quietly took a photograph. It showed Prokopi, in jeans and boots, sitting on a sofa and holding a paper cup. \n\n\n\n\n\nOver the summer, the photograph was passed around in Mongolia as investigators there looked into whether Prokopi had ever visited the country. A Mongolian paleontologist gave a sworn police statement saying that, in June, 2009, Prokopi had paid him fifty dollars a day to help him dig dinosaurs for a week or so in the Gobi. They travelled into the desert in a Land Cruiser, with a guide, following a map that Prokopi had of known dinosaur sites. A search of customs and hotel registries indicated that Prokopi had also visited Mongolia in 2008 and 2011. On at least one of the trips, a Mongolian source told me, he shared a hotel room in Ulaanbaatar with Chris Moore. (Moore, through his New York attorney, declined to comment for this article.) \n\n\n\nInvestigators focussed on the Gobi guide, who, according to the Mongolian paleontologistâs statement, owned an âantique museum, a private museum,â and had bragged that he had hung out with Prokopi in the States. Investigators searched the guideâs home and confiscated a computer, on which they found a 2008 letter to a fossil buyer in Japan. The letter, which was incomplete, began, âDear Butts.â It continued, in part, âI told people that I would buy a head of Tarbosaurââa _T. bataarâ_âand I offered high price for any size. . . . Following my offer many expeditions went to countryside.â The letter included a price list: forty thousand dollars for the head of a velociraptor, forty thousand for the head of a _T. bataar_, five thousand for the claws of a _T. bataar_. The letter informed âButtsâ that he owed thirty-seven thousand six hundred dollars and would need to pay fifty per cent up front before receiving any more shipments. âPeople are getting more and more cautions [sic] here,â the letter continued. âIn Mongolia the price [of] everything is rising.â The letter-writer added, âWe have been in business cooperation for many years. You know that I donât do temporary business. I do see the future when dealing with people.â\n\n\n\nIf the letterâs author was indeed the Gobi guide, there is no more future to speak of. He died in 2011âof illness, a source in the fossil trade told me. \n\n\n\nThere is a fossil dealer living in Japan named Hollis Butts. He would communicate with me only by e-mail, and he denied any connection with the _T. bataar_ bones, though he said that he had done other work with Prokopi. Butts identified the Gobi guide as a fossil supplier with whom he had done business, but he said that their relationship had âfinished well before 2007.â When asked about the 2008 letter to âButts,â he said, âI suspect it was a letter to someone else, with âMr. Buttsâ written on top.â\n\n\n\nBy fall, federal authorities in New York had fattened their case. They had discovered that, on one fossil shipment, Prokopi had changed the country of origin from Mongolia to Japan. Scientists from a host of nations had issued statements saying that the _T. bataar_ could have come only from Mongolia. An inspection of customs records revealed that the specimen was not Prokopiâs first contested dinosaur. In May, 2010, the Department of Homeland Security had stopped a shipment described first as a âsample of craft rock,â and then as a âfossil replica,â which turned out to be a Chinese microraptor. When the government seized the fossils, Prokopi had complained, in a letter, that he had â$1,000 invested in this itemâ and claimed that the mixup could likely be attributed to the shipperâs poor English. \n\n\n\nFederal agents in the _T. bataar_ investigation obtained access to Prokopiâs AOL account, and found numerous e-mail exchanges with business associates that centered on the buying, selling, and prepping of âTarbosâ and âMongol fossils.â The agents also confiscated the saurolophusâthe duck-billed dinosaur that had failed to sell at the Chait auction in early May. Prokopiâs civil attorneys advised him to get a criminal lawyer. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Mongolia, several suspects were detained, including one of the Gobi guideâs relatives. Interpol was now involved. The Mongolian public had taken a strong interest in the _T. bataar_. When Robert Painter, the Houston attorney, travelled to Ulaanbaatar to meet with President Elbegdorj, a TV station interviewed him for half an hourâthe segment aired live, without commercial breaks. \n\n\n\nOyungerel Tsedevdamba, one of the Mongolians who had helped launch the campaign to save the fossil, told me over Skype that government officials in Ulaanbaatar were thinking of the _T. bataar_ case âas a way to clean out our house.â She noted, â_T. bataar_ is actually fighting for our democracy. Weâre going to use it to fight corruption. _T. bataar_ will change lots of things in Mongolia if it comes back.â \n\n\n\nAnd if it doesnât? \n\n\n\nâEven if it doesnât, we will hunt down the pipeline.â\n\n\n\nOver the summer, she had been elected to Parliament and named minister of culture. Dinosaur tourism, as yet only a concept in Mongolia, now fell within her jurisdiction.  \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5f700f529324ac062a8e]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\nâPeople said, âWhy do you need to study dinosaurs?â â she told me. âI said, âThereâs so much mining going on in the Mongolian Gobi, and there are so many dinosaurs. You need proper policies.â I needed to know how to protect them and make museums for them.â \n\n\n\nMongolians have never been widely exposed to paleontology, despite the rich bone beds. The countryâs only natural-history museum, in Ulaanbaatar, is an unattractive, poorly kept, Soviet-era tomb. Bolor Minjin can imagine the _T. bataar_ inaugurating a new scientific era. She told me, âI hope the return of the _T. bataar_ skeleton will generate enthusiasm among Mongolians, and that they will urge the government to build new museums and train the next generation of paleontologists.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nEarly on the morning of October 17th, a Wednesday, about two dozen federal agents and sheriffâs deputies arrived at Serenola, got Prokopi out of bed, and arrested him on three counts involving smuggling. Amanda and the children were kept upstairs as he was handcuffed and led away. Then she drove the kids to school.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agents spent the day searching the house and the workshop. They packed fossils, electronics, business papers, and other items into cardboard boxes stamped â*EVIDENCE*{: .small}.â Late in the morning, a U.P.S. truck happened to arrive, and for Prokopi the timing could not have been worse. The four-hundred-pound delivery was from I. M. Chait, and contained the bones of another dinosaur: a Mongolian oviraptor. \n\n\n\nEric and Amanda put up Serenola as collateral to free him on bond, and by late afternoon he was home. He had surrendered his passport. On Sunday night, he flew to New York and checked into the Fairfield Inn & Suites, in Times Square. The next morning, he dressed in a dark suit, a white shirt, and a red tie, and went downtown, to Duane Street, to meet with his criminal lawyer, Georges Lederman. At two oâclock, they entered a fifth-floor magistrateâs courtroom, Prokopi carrying a soft-sided briefcase and looking distressed.\n\n\n\nWhen his case was called, he took a seat next to Lederman at the defenseâs table, in a high-backed leather chair. His crowâs-feet crinkled whenever he murmured a response to one of Ledermanâs whispered questions. Martin Bell, the lead prosecutor in the criminal case, asked the judge to raise the bond to six hundred thousand dollars. The judge looked at the pretrial-services forms and noted that Prokopi had fifteen hundred dollars in his checking account and seven hundred in cash. A background search had turned up two traffic citations. Prokopi had been married for a decade and had a stable residence and two young children. âIs there really a risk that heâll leave the country?â the judge asked.\n\n\n\nBell said that Prokopi was sitting on about âhalf a million dollarsâ worth of dinosaur fossilsâ and had powerful connections overseas. The judge asked if there was some sort of underground market in dinosaurs that he wasnât aware of. âI thought they were sold at auction,â he said. Bell told him that the international black market in fossils has been able to âhide in plain sight,â and that trafficking âfar exceedsâ the current efforts of law enforcement.\n\n\n\nThey went back and forth for nearly an hour. The judge ordered that Amanda also surrender her passport. He ordered Prokopi not to travel beyond northern Florida once he got home, and he raised the bond to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\n\n\nTwo months later, on December 27th, Prokopi returned to New York and pleaded guilty to customs-related crimes that carried a maximum seventeen-year sentence and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. The plea agreement required that he abandon all claims on the _T. bataar_ and the duck-billed dinosaur, and on four more Mongolian and Chinese dinosaurs to which federal prosecutors could now connect him: two oviraptors and two more _T. bataars_, one of them believed to be somewhere in Great Britain. \n\n\n\nâTell me what you did,â the judge said to Prokopi. \n\n\n\nProkopi responded that he had instructed an associate in China to undervalue one shipment, and had imported fossils with âvagueâ and âmisleadingâ labels.\n\n\n\nâSo you mislabelled it to make sure it would be imported?â the judge said.\n\n\n\nâRight,â Prokopi said.\n\n\n\nNothing more was revealed about how his dinosaur business worked: about who had dug the original _T. bataar_, or when, or how it had been removed from Mongolia. The judge set the sentencing hearing for April, and court was adjourned. \n\n\n\nâMy client is radioactive when it comes to being able to earn a living in his business,â Lederman had told the court at Prokopiâs arraignment. In fact, a dealer, once tarnished, is not necessarily finished. Convicted hunters have been known to return directly to the field. In Prokopiâs case, Mongolia will be out of the question. But the Florida waters and quarries are still full of Ice Age bones. At the start of 2013, eBay alone had more than forty thousand fossils, rocks, and minerals for sale. \n\n\n\nHeritage Auctions, for its part, has reorganized its natural-history department. Greg Rohan, the company president, told me that it plans to continue selling fossils, but added, âWeâre going to want to see a lot more proof of origin.â On August 28th, Heritage notified David Herskowitz that his contract would not be renewed. He hopes to open a new natural-history department at another auction house. \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn December, the Prokopis put Serenola on the market for eight hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars. They had been offering various other items on eBayâtheir first sales since Juneâincluding a slab of Florida cypress salvaged from the Suwannee River, and Amandaâs 2002 Lexus S.U.V., which sold for ninety-one hundred dollars. \n\n\n\n\n\nBy January, when I visited them again, the Prokopis had decided to sell as many belongings as they couldâfrom pool furniture to prints on the wallsâand move in temporarily with Amandaâs mother, in Virginia. Instead of the Lexus, Amanda told me, they now had two âsmaller, dumpierâ cars. They had no savings. âIt was all in the dinosaurs,â she said. \n\n\n\nIn Virginia, Amanda hopes to continue working as an interior decorator. Eric plans to revive his fossil business, by doing prep work and making casts. He recently canvassed some ranch land in Wyoming, looking for prime fossil-hunting spots, and hopes to open a dinosaur quarry nearby. âItâs competitive,â he said. âIt takes a while to get in on something.â\n\n\n\nâAnd itâs a lot of time away,â Amanda said. âEvery time he goes out West, itâs months of time that heâs not with his kids.â\n\n\n\nâYeah, the Mongolian stuff basically just arrived here and didnât require me to be gone a lot,â Eric said.\n\n\n\nAmanda said, âWhat kills me is that we watch these clips from the news and people are laughing about it. People think itâs funny. Itâs not. Itâs our life. Itâs pretty much over.â She began crying, for the second or third time. \n\n\n\nâItâs not over,â Eric told her. âBut weâre gonna start over.â\n\n\n\nItâs over âas we know it,â Amanda said. âAnd for what? For bones? No oneâs been murdered. We restored a dinosaur. You know?â \n\n\n\nEric had photocopied two texts for me to take home. In one, he had highlighted a passage about the relative commonness of _T. bataar_, which, he believed, underscored his point that his specimens were scientifically unimportant. The other was a German magazine article about a Hamburg dealer of Mongolian fossils. Prokopi suggested that the article offered proof that the Mongolians have sanctioned some commercial exports. I pressed him: had this happened with the _T. bataar_? Prokopi said only that he had heard of exportation permits being granted in the past, and initially believed that such permits would be issued for the _T. bataar_. When the dinosaur reached Great Britain, he discovered that there were no permits, and imported the fossils anyway. I asked for copies of the past permits, and for the names of those who provided them. He declined, saying, âThereâs details about my dealings and associations in Mongolia that Iâd like to talk about, but I donât think I can.â\n\n\n\nPainter, President Elbegdorjâs attorney, said, âProkopiâs story evolves every time thereâs a new hurdle. If Prokopi believes he was duped, the Mongolian government would love to know about that. All we want is a name, and the government will aggressively investigate.â\n\n\n\nProkopi, meanwhile, is getting ready for the Tucson show, in February, by restoring a giraffe skeleton and âlow-end bulk stuff.â Lederman has asked federal authorities to release the Prokopisâ seized possessions. Among them is a cast that Prokopi made of the _T. bataar_. He hopes to sell it in Tucson, for at least thirty thousand dollars. \n\n\n\nThe real _T. bataar_ will go home in the spring. The Mongolian government recently decided to turn an old Lenin museum into a new dinosaur museum.

Geology was at that point a brand-new science, a circumstance reflected in the societyâs goals, which were to stimulate âzealâ for the discipline and to induce participants âto adopt one nomenclature.â There followed long, often spirited debates on matters such as where to fix the borders of the Devonian period. âThough I donât much care for geology,â one visitor to the societyâs early meetings noted, âI do like to see the fellows fight.â\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Geol Soc is now headquartered in a stone mansion not far from Piccadilly Circus. On the outside, the style of the mansion is Palladian; inside, it leans more toward mid-century public library. Much of the place is wrapped in plastic, owing to a construction project that never quite seems to reach completion. Near the reception desk, behind a green velvet curtain, hangs a copy of the first geological map of Britain, which was published in 1815 by William Smith. (Smithâs British biographer has called the map âone of the classics of English scienceâ; his American counterpart has pronounced it âthe map that changed the world.â) At the top of the stairs, thereâs a reading room with a brass chandelier, a few armchairs, some scuffed tables, and a broken coffee machine.\n\n\n\nOn a sunny morning not long ago, Jan Zalasiewicz, a stratigrapher and longtime society member, was sitting in the reading room, wishing the coffee machine were functional so that he could make a cup of tea. Zalasiewicz is a slight, almost elfin man with shaggy graying hair and narrow blue eyes. He had come down to London that morning from his home, in Nottinghamshire, to give a visitor a tour. His perspective on the Geol Soc, and on the city more generally, was, he had to admit, idiosyncratic.\n\n\n\nâThis building has never been considered as a rock before,â he observed. âBut it is just as much made of geology as anything you would find out in the field.\n\n\n\nâClearly, very few of these objects will survive Pompeii style,â he went on, gesturing, with a faraway look in his eyes, toward the chairs, the tables, the magazine racks, and the coffee machine. âBut they wonât simply disappear. Theyâll break down into rubble, and the rubble will be washed away. But even the rubble thatâs been washed away will have its own character, its own signal.â He swivelled to take in the windows (mostly silica) and the panelling (made of wood). âPotentially, everything here is fossilizable,â he said.\n\n\n\nWalter White-like, Zalasiewicz leads a double life. By day, heâs an expert on a group of ancient marine organisms known as graptolites. Zalasiewicz deeply admires graptolites, which thrived and diversified in the early Paleozoic, some five hundred million years ago, only to be very nearly wiped out in a catastrophic extinction event. Present him with a fossilized graptolite and he can tell you at a glance which biozone of the Silurian period it belongs to.\n\n\n\nIn his off-hours, Zalasiewicz is a provocateur, or, to be more British about it, âa scientific hooligan.â He has more or less invented a new discipline, which might be called the stratigraphy of the future. It is based on a simple, if disturbing, premise: humans are so radically refashioning the planetâlevelling so many forests, eliminating so many creatures that once occupied those forests, transporting so many other creatures around the globe, and burning through such vast quantities of fossil fuels to keep the whole enterprise goingâthat we may well end up producing a catastrophe comparable in scale to the one that laid waste to the graptolites. Already, Zalasiewicz is convinced, the geology of the planet has been permanently altered. The signal that will be left behind by our cities, our carbon emissions, and our potentially fossilizable detritus is strong enough, he maintains, that even a moderately competent stratigrapher, at a distance of a hundred million years or so, should be able to tell that something extraordinary happened in what to us represents the present. âWe have already left a record that is now indelible,â he has written.\n\n\n\nIn recognition of the ways that, collectively, we are all world-changers, Zalasiewicz believes that an adjustment in nomenclature is called for. Officially, our epoch is the Holocene, but Zalasiewicz believes it would probably be more accurate to say that we have entered the Anthropocene. He is trying to persuade his colleagues to formally consider this new term. He hopes to bring the matter to a vote of the International Commission on Stratigraphy in 2016. If he has his way, every geology textbook in the world will instantly become obsolete.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe path led up a hill, across a stream, back across the stream, and past the carcass of a sheep, which looked deflated, like a lost balloon. The hill was bright green, but treeless; generations of the sheepâs relatives had kept anything from growing much above muzzle height. As far as I was concerned, it was raining. But in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, I was told, this counted only as a light drizzle, or smirr.\n\n\n\n\n\nZalasiewicz and I and two of his colleagues from the British Geological Survey had driven for more than five hours to get to the Uplands from the Surveyâs headquarters, near Nottingham. We were hiking to a spot called Dobâs Linn, where, according to an old ballad, the Devil himself was pushed over a precipice by a pious shepherd named Dob. By the time we reached the cliff, the smirr seemed to be smirring harder. There was a view over a waterfall, which crashed down into a narrow valley. A few yards farther up the path loomed a jagged outcropping of rock. It was striped vertically, like a refereeâs jersey, in bands of light and dark. Zalasiewicz set his rucksack down on the soggy ground and adjusted his red rain jacket. He pointed to one of the dark-colored stripes. âBad things happened in here,â he told me.\n\n\n\nMuch as Civil War buffs visit Gettysburg, stratigraphers are drawn to Dobâs Linn. Itâs one of those rare places where, owing to an accident of plate tectonics, a major turning point in lifeâs history is visible right on the surface of the earth. In this case, the event is the end-Ordovician extinction, which occurred some four hundred and forty million years ago. In addition to nearly knocking out the graptolites, it killed off something like eighty per cent of the planetâs species. (âHad the list of survivors been one jot different,â Richard Fortey, a British paleontologist and a recent president of the Geol Soc, has observed, âthen so would the world today.â) Not coincidentally, Dobâs Linn is also a great place to find graptolites.\n\n\n\nTo the naked eye, graptolite fossils look a bit like scratches and a bit like hieroglyphics. (âGraptoliteâ comes from the Greek, meaning âwritten rockâ; the term was coined by Linnaeus, who dismissed graptolites as mineral encrustations trying to pass themselves off as the remnants of animals.) Viewed through a hand lens, they often prove to have lovely, evocative shapes; one species suggests a feather, another a lyre, a third the frond of a fern. Graptolites were colonial animals. Each one, known as a zooid, built itself a tiny, tubular shelter, known as a theca, that was attached to its neighborâs, like a row house. A single graptolite fossil thus represents a whole community, which drifted or, more probably, swam along as a single entity, feeding off even smaller plankton. Zalasiewicz lent me a hammer, and one of the graptolites I hacked out of the rock face had been preserved with peculiar clarity. It was shaped like a set of false eyelashes, but very small, as if for a Barbie. Zalasiewicz told meâdoubtless exaggeratingâthat I had found a âmuseum-quality specimen.â I pocketed it.\n\n\n\nGraptolites had a habitâendearing from a stratigrapherâs point of viewâof speciating, spreading out, and dying off, all in relatively short order. Zalasiewicz likened them to Natasha, the tender heroine of âWar and Peace.â They were, he told me, âdelicate, nervous, and very sensitive to things around them.â This makes them useful âindex fossilsââsuccessive species can be used to identify successive layers of rock.\n\n\n\nOnce Zalasiewicz showed me what to look for at Dobâs Linn, I, too, could see that âbad thingsâ happened here. The dark stripes were shale; in them, graptolites were plentiful and varied. This indicated that there was nothing alive to consume the animals once theyâd died and sunk to the seafloor. Soon, Iâd collected so many that the pockets of my jacket were sagging. Many of the fossils were variations on the letter âV,â with two arms branching away from a central node. Some looked like zippers, others like wishbones. Still others had arms growing off their arms, like tiny trees.\n\n\n\nThe lighter stoneâalso shaleâwas barren, with barely a graptolite to be found in it. Paradoxically, this was a sign of a healthy ocean floor, with lots of scavengers living in the muck. The transition from one state to anotherâfrom gray stone to black, from no graptolites to manyâappears to have occurred suddenly and, according to Zalasiewicz, _did_ occur suddenly. âThe change here from gray to black marks a tipping point, if you like, from a habitable seafloor to an uninhabitable one,â Zalasiewicz said. âAnd one might have seen that in the span of a human lifetime.â He described this transition as âCuvierian.â\n\n\n\nZalasiewiczâs colleagues from the British Geological Survey, Dan Condon and Ian Millar, had come to Dobâs Linn to collect samples from the various stripes. (Zalasiewicz also worked for many years at the B.G.S.; he now teaches at the University of Leicester.) The samples, they hoped, would contain tiny crystals of zircon, which, after some complicated chemical manipulations, would allow them to date the layers of rock quite precisely. Millar, who grew up in Scotland, at first claimed to be undaunted by the smirr. But after a while even he admitted that it was pouring. Rivulets of mud were cascading down the face of the outcropping, compromising the samples. It was decided that we would have to come back the following day. The geologists packed up their gear and we squished back down the trail to the car. Zalasiewicz had made reservations at a bed-and-breakfast in the nearby town of Moffat. The townâs attractions, I had read, included Britainâs narrowest hotel and a bronze sheep.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe idea that the world can change suddenly and drasticallyââin the span of a human lifetimeââis very old and, at the same time, very new. To the early members of the Geol Soc, the role of catastrophe in the earthâs history was self-evident. These menâand they were, of course, all menâhad read the great nineteenth-century French naturalist Georges Cuvier, who interpreted the fossil record as a chronicle of recurring tragedy. (When the Napoleonic Wars ended, in 1815, Cuvier was made an honorary Geol Soc member.)\n\n\n\n\n\nâLife on earth has often been disturbed by terrible events,â Cuvier wrote. âLiving organisms without number have been the victims of these catastrophes.â\n\n\n\nCuvierâs view of life was challenged by Charles Lyell, another of the nineteenth centuryâs most influential naturalists. According to Lyell, who served as the Geol Socâs fourteenth president and also as its twenty-first, the earth was capable of changing only very gradually. The way to understand the distant past was to look at the present. Since no one had ever seen the kind of cataclysm that Cuvier invoked, it was unscientific, or, to use Lyellâs term, âunphilosophical,â to imagine that such events took place. If it appeared from the fossil record that the world had changed abruptly, Lyell maintained, this just went to show how little the record was to be trusted. \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5ddd0f529324ac06294e]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\nAmong the early converts to Lyellâs view was Charles Darwin. In âOn the Origin of Species,â Darwin acknowledged that there were points in the earthâs history when it appeared that âwhole families or ordersâ had suddenly been exterminated. But, like Lyell, he took this as evidence that âwide intervals of timeâ were unaccounted for. Had the evidence of these intervals not been lost, it would have shown âmuch slow extermination.â He wrote, âSo profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world!â\n\n\n\nSuch was Lyell and Darwinâs influence that for more than a century, even as it became increasingly clear that âwhole families or ordersâ had indeed at various points suddenly been eliminated, geologists eschewed any account of these episodes that might be construed as Cuvierian. This reluctance extended into the nineteen-eighties, when it was proposed that an asteroid plowing into the earth at the end of the Cretaceous period, sixty-five million years ago, was what had done in the dinosaurs, along with the plesiosaurs, the mosasaurs, the pterosaurs, the ammonites, most birds, and a significant proportion of mammals. The impact hypothesis was resisted until the nineteen-nineties, when the existence of a huge impact crater formed precisely at the end of the Cretaceous was confirmed. The crater lies off the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, buried under half a mile of newer sediment.\n\n\n\nWhile the discovery of the impact crater didnât exactly invalidate Lyell and Darwinâs model, it revealed their dismissal of catastrophe to have been itself âunphilosophical.â Life on earth _has_ been âdisturbed by terrible events,â and âliving organisms without numberâ have been their victims. What is sometimes called âneocatastrophism,â but is mostly now just considered mainstream geology, holds that the world changes only very slowly, except when it doesnât.\n\n\n\nAs best as can be determined, the rate of change today is as fast as itâs been at any time since the asteroid impact. This is why Zalasiewicz believes that the stratigraphers of the future should have a relatively easy time of it, even though who or what was responsible for the sudden alteration of the planet may not immediately be clear. At one point, he mused, âIt may take them a little while to sort out whether we were the drivers of this, or if the cats or the dogs or the sheep were.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nAfter everyone had changed into dry clothes, we met in the sitting room of the B. and B. for tea. Zalasiewicz had brought along several papers he had recently published on graptolites. Settling back in their chairs, Condon and Millar rolled their eyes. Zalasiewicz ignored them, patiently explaining to me the import of his latest monograph, âGraptolites in British Stratigraphy,â which ran to sixty-six pages and included illustrations of more than six hundred and fifty species. In the monograph, the effects of the extinction event showed up more systematically, if also less vividly, than on the rain-slicked hillside. Until the end of the Ordovician, V-shaped graptolites were common. These included species like the _Dicranograptus ziczac_, whose tiny cups were arranged along arms that curled away and then toward each other, like tusks; and _Amphigraptus divergens_, which was shaped like a bat in flight. Only a handful of graptolite species survived the end-Ordovician extinction, which, itâs now believed, was caused by the sudden glaciation of the supercontinent Gondwana. (No one is entirely sure what caused this glaciation.) Eventually, the surviving graptolites diversified and repopulated the seas of the Silurian. But Silurian graptolites had a streamlined body plan, more like a stick than like a set of branches. The V shape had been lost, never to reappear. Here, writ very, very small, was the fate of the dinosaurs, the pterosaurs, and the ammonitesâa once highly successful form now relegated to oblivion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat evening, when everyone had had enough of tea and graptolites, we went out to the pub on the ground floor of Britainâs narrowest hotel, which is twenty feet across. After a pint or two, the conversation turned to another one of Zalasiewiczâs favorite subjects: giant rats. Zalasiewicz pointed out that rats have followed humans to just about every corner of the globe, and it is his professional opinion that one day they will take over the earth.\n\n\n\nâSome number will probably stay rat-size and rat-shaped,â he told me. âBut others may well shrink or expand. Particularly if thereâs been epidemic extinction and ecospace opens up, rats may be best placed to take advantage of that. And we know that change in size can take place fairly quickly.â I recalled once watching a rat drag a pizza crust along the tracks at an Upper West Side subway station. I imagined it waddling through a deserted tunnel, blown up to the size of a Doberman.\n\n\n\nThough the connection might seem tenuous, Zalasiewiczâs interest in giant rats represents a logical extension of his interest in graptolites. When he studies the Ordovician and the Silurian, heâs trying to reconstruct the distant past on the basis of the fragmentary clues that remainâfossils, isotopes of carbon, layers of sedimentary rock. When he contemplates the future, heâs trying to imagine what will remain of the present once the contemporary world has been reduced to fragmentsâfossils, isotopes of carbon, layers of sedimentary rock. One of the many aspects of the Anthropocene that he believes will leave a permanent mark is a reshuffling of the biosphere.\n\n\n\nOften purposefully and just as often not, people have transported living things around the globe, importing the flora and fauna of Asia to the Americas and of the Americas to Europe and of Europe to Australia. Rats have consistently been in the vanguard of these movements, and they have left their bones scattered everywhere, including on islands so remote that humans never bothered to settle them. The Pacific rat, _Rattus exulans_, a native of Southeast Asia, travelled with Polynesian seafarers to, among many other places, Hawaii, Fiji, Tahiti, Tonga, Samoa, Easter Island, and New Zealand. Encountering few predators, stowaway _Rattus exulans_ multiplied into what Richard Holdaway, a New Zealand paleontologist, has described as âa grey tideâ that turned âeverything edible into rat protein.â (A recent study in the _Journal of Archaeological Science_ concluded that it wasnât humans who deforested Easter Island; rather, it was the rats that came along for the ride and then bred unchecked. The native palms couldnât produce seeds fast enough to keep up with their appetite.)\n\n\n\nWhen Europeans arrived in the Americas, and then continued west to the islands that the Polynesians had settled, they brought with them the even more adaptable Norway rat, _Rattus norvegicus_. In many places, Norway rats, which are actually from China, outcompeted the earlier rat invaders and ravaged whatever bird and reptile populations the Pacific rats had missed. Rats thus might be said to have created their own âecospace,â which their progeny seem well positioned to dominate. The descendants of todayâs rats, according to Zalasiewicz, will radiate out to fill the niches that _Rattus exulans_ and _Rattus norvegicus_ helped empty. He imagines the rats of the future evolving into new shapes and sizesâsome âsmaller than shrews,â others as large as elephants.\n\n\n\nâWe might,â he has written, in âThe Earth After Usâ (2008), âinclude among themâfor curiosityâs sake and to keep our options openâa species or two of large naked rodent, living in caves, shaping rocks as primitive tools and wearing the skins of other mammals that they have killed and eaten.â\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, whatever the future holds for rats, the extinction event that they are helping to bring about will leave its own mark. Many evolutionary lineages have recently come to an end; many, many more are likely soon to follow. Extinction rates today are hundreds of times higherâfor some groups, such as amphibians and freshwater mollusks, perhaps thousands, or even tens of thousands, of times higherâthan theyâve been since mammals took over the âecospaceâ emptied by the dinosaurs. For reasons of geological history, the current extinction event is often referred to as the âsixth extinction.â (By this accounting, the event recorded in the rocks at Dobâs Linn is the first of the five major mass extinctions that have occurred since complex animal life evolved.) Whether the âsixth extinctionâ will turn out to be anywhere near as drastic as the first is impossible to know; nevertheless, it is likely to appear in the fossil record as a turning point. Climate changeâitself a driver of extinctionâwill also leave behind geological traces, as will deforestation, industrial pollution, and monoculture farming.\n\n\n\nUltimately, most of our carbon emissions will end up in the oceans; this will dramatically alter the chemistry of the water, turning it more acidic. Ocean acidification is associated with some of the worst crises in biotic history, including whatâs known as the end-Permian extinctionâthe third of the so-called Big Fiveâwhich took place roughly two hundred and fifty million years ago and killed off something like ninety per cent of the species on the planet.\n\n\n\nâOh, ocean acidification,â Zalasiewicz said when we returned to Dobâs Linn the following day. âThatâs the big nasty one thatâs coming down.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn recent years, a number of names have been proposed for the new age that humans have ushered in. The noted conservation biologist Michael SoulÃ© has suggested that, instead of the Cenozoic, we now live in the âCatastrophozoicâ era. Michael Samways, an entomologist at South Africaâs Stellenbosch University, has floated the term âHomogenocene.â Daniel Pauly, a Canadian marine biologist, has recommended the âMyxocene,â from the Greek word for âslime,â and Andrew Revkin, an American journalist, has offered the âAnthrocene.â (Most of these terms owe their origins, indirectly at least, to Lyell, who, back in the eighteen-thirties, coined the names Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word âAnthropoceneâ was put into circulation by Paul Crutzen, a Dutch chemist who, in 1995, shared a Nobel Prize for discovering the effects of ozone-depleting compounds. The importance of this discovery is difficult to overstate. Had it not been madeâand had the chemicals continued to be widely usedâthe ozone âholeâ that opens up every spring over Antarctica would have expanded until, eventually, it encircled the entire globe. One of Crutzenâs fellow-Nobelists reportedly came home from his lab one night and said to his wife, âThe work is going well, but it looks like the end of the world.â\n\n\n\nCrutzen once told me that the word âAnthropoceneâ came to him while he was in a meeting. The meetingâs chairman kept referring to the Holocene, the âwholly recentâ epoch, which began at the conclusion of the last ice age, eleven and a half thousand years ago. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, or I.C.S., which maintains the official geological time scale, the Holocene continues to this day.\n\n\n\nâÂ âLetâs stop it,âÂ â Crutzen recalled blurting out. âÂ âWe are no longer in the Holocene; we are in the Anthropocene.â Well, it was quiet in the room for a while.â At the next coffee break, the Anthropocene was the main topic of conversation. Someone came up to Crutzen and suggested that he patent the term.\n\nCrutzen wrote up his idea in a short essay, titled âGeology of Mankind,â which ran in the journal _Nature_. âIt seems appropriate to assign the term âAnthropoceneâ to the present, in many ways human-dominated, geological epoch,â he observed. Among the many geologic-scale changes people have effected, Crutzen cited the following:   \n\n\n> Human activity has transformed between a third and a half of the land surface of the planet. \n> \n> \n> \n> Many of the worldâs major rivers have been dammed or diverted.\n> \n> \n> \n> Fertilizer plants produce more nitrogen than is fixed naturally by all terrestrial ecosystems.\n> \n> \n> \n> Humans use more than half of the worldâs readily accessible freshwater runoff.\n\n\n\nMost significant, Crutzen noted, people have altered the composition of the atmosphere. Owing to a combination of fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has risen by more than a third in the past two centuries, while the concentration of methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas, has more than doubled. Just a few more decades of emissions may bring atmospheric CO~2~ to a level not seen since the mid-Miocene, fifteen million years ago. A few decades after that, it could easily reach a level not seen since the Eocene, some fifty million years ago. During the Eocene, palm trees flourished in the Antarctic, and alligators paddled around the British Isles.\n\n\n\nâBecause of these anthropogenic emissions,â Crutzen wrote, the global climate is likely to âdepart significantly from natural behavior for many millennia to come.â \n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5ddf20855957e69d52f5]||||||\n+++\n \n\n\n\nCrutzen published âGeology of Mankindâ in 2002. Soon, the Anthropocene began migrating into other scientific journals. âGlobal Analysis of River Systems: From Earth System Controls to Anthropocene Syndromesâ was the title of a 2003 article in the journal _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B_. âSoils and Sediments in the Anthropocene,â ran the headline of a piece, from 2004, in the _Journal of Soils and Sediments_.\n\n\n\nZalasiewicz noticed that most of those using the term were not trained in the fine points of stratigraphy, and he wondered how his colleagues felt about this. At the time, he was head of the Geol Socâs stratigraphy committee, and during a meeting one day he asked the members what they thought of the Anthropocene. Of the twenty-two stratigraphers present, twenty-one thought that the concept had merit.\n\n\n\nâMy response was itâs a very interesting and powerful idea,â Andy Gale, a professor at the University of Portsmouth, told me. âI felt it was worthwhile to pursue, because itâs an important tool for making people think.â\n\n\n\nThe group decided to approach the concept as a formal problem. Would the Anthropocene satisfy the stratigraphic criteria used for naming a new epoch? (To geologists, an epoch is a subdivision of a period, which, in turn, is a division of an era; the Holocene, for instance, is an epoch of the Quaternary, which is a period in the Cenozoic.) After a yearâs worth of study, the answer that the group arrived at was an unqualified yes. Among other things, the members observed in a paper summarizing their findings, the Anthropocene will be marked by a unique âbiostratigraphic signal,â a product of the current extinction event, on the one hand, and of the human propensity for redistributing life, on the other. This signal will be permanently inscribed, they wrote, âas future evolution will take place from surviving (and frequently anthropogenically relocated) stocks.â\n\n\n\nOr, as Zalasiewicz would have it, giant rats.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nJust as in the early years of the Geol Soc, stratigraphers today spend a lot of time arguing about borders. A few years ago, after much heated discussion, members of the I.C.S. voted to move the start of the Pleistocene epoch from about 1.8 million to about 2.6 million years ago. This decision was part of a broader, and even fiercer, debate about whether to do away with the Quaternary, the period that spans both the Pleistocene and the Holocene, and fold it into the Neogene. (The elimination of the Quaternary was vigorouslyâand, ultimately, successfullyâresisted by Quaternary stratigraphers.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate over the Anthropoceneâs borders is complicated by the fact that the geology of the epoch is, at this point, almost entirely prospective. The way stratigraphers usually define boundariesâonce theyâve stopped arguing about themâis by choosing a particularly fossil-rich sequence of rocks to serve as a reference. These reference sequences are colloquially known as âgolden spikesââtechnically, theyâre called Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points, or G.S.S.P.sâand theyâre scattered around the world (though a disproportionate number are in Europe). The striped rocks at Dobâs Linn have been designated the golden spike for the start of the Silurian period. For the base of the Carboniferous, the golden spike is near the town of CabriÃ¨res, in southern France, and for the start of the Triassic itâs in the hills of Meishan, China. (The Chinese have tried to turn this last golden spike into a tourist destination, with a manicured park and a statue of a tooth from a once common eel-like creature known as a conodont.)\n\n\n\nSince the rocks of the Anthropocene donât yet exist, itâs impossible to choose an exemplary sequence of them. To stratigraphers, then, a key, but also rather vexing, question is what could serve instead of the traditional golden spike. In 2009, the I.C.S. set up an Anthropocene Working Group to examine this and related issues; not surprisingly, Zalasiewicz was appointed chairman. At the time of our visit to London, he told me that he thought there were many possible ways that the start of the epoch could be designated. One would simply be to choose a dateâ1800, say, or 1950. This is how geological periods of the deep, pre-fossiliferous past are defined; whatâs known as the Neoproterozoic era, for example, is said to have begun precisely one billion years ago.\n\n\n\nAnother possibility would be to use nuclear fallout. The aboveground tests of the mid-twentieth century dispersed radioactive particles all around the globe. Some have half-lives of more than a thousand years; in a few cases, like uranium-236, the figure is in the tens of millions. To future geologists, the fallout will thus present a novel radioactive âspikeâ (assuming, that is, that the future does not hold a nuclear war). This sort of geochemical marker is used to define the end of the Cretaceous. The impact that occurred during the final seconds of the period left behind a thin layer of sediment containing anomalously high concentrations of the element iridiumâthe so-called âiridium spike.â\n\n\n\nYet another possibility is to use the worldâs subway systems, an idea that also has precedent in deep time. Geologists refer to the outlines of burrows that creatures left behind in the sediments as âtrace fossils.â The start of the Cambrian period, some five hundred and forty million years ago, is defined as the point when the first complex burrows appear; these left impressions in the rocks which resemble scattered grains of rice. (No one is sure what the animals that made the burrows looked like, as their bodies have not been preserved.) Londonâs subway system, the worldâs oldest, will leave behind an enormous set of trace fossils, as will New Yorkâs and Seoulâs and Parisâs and Dubaiâs.\n\n\n\nâAll the great world cities have underground systems now,â Mark Williams, a stratigrapher who teaches at the University of Leicester and is a member of the Anthropocene Working Group, noted. âTheyâre extensive, theyâre fairly permanent from a geological perspective, and theyâre a very, very good indicator of the complexity thatâs come to characterize the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.â\n\n\n\nWilliams told me that the response to the idea of formalizing the Anthropocene had âgenerally been very positive.â (Just in the past few months, three new academic journals focussing on the Anthropocene have been launched.) But, as is to be expected from a group that can sustain a decade-long disagreement about the status of the Quaternary, thereâs still plenty of dissent. Some critics argue that humans have been altering the planet for thousands of years already, so why get all worked up about it now?\n\n\n\nâWe can see that human interactions with the landscape are increasing,â Philip Gibbard, a stratigrapher at Cambridge, told me. âNo one disputes that. We build buildings. We build towns. We build roads. We drop plastic bags in the ocean. All thatâs absolutely true. But from a geological perspectiveâand I have to speak as a geologist, not as a generally interested personâI think whatâs happening now is just a logical continuation of something that began as human populations started to increase at the beginning of the Holocene.\n\n\n\nâIt is quite exciting to pursue this new idea,â he added. âBut Iâm suspicious of it.â\n\n\n\nOther critics are skeptical of the idea for opposite reasons. They point out that human impacts on the planet are likely to become even more pronounced, and hence more stratigraphically significant, as time goes on. Thus, whatâs sometimes referred to in geological circles as the âevent horizonâ has not yet been reached.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Zalasiewicz is sympathetic to both lines of argument. Humans _have_ been altering the planet for quite a while, though probably the impacts of the past were orders of magnitude more modest than they are today. And a few centuries from now the impacts of human activity may be orders of magnitude greater again. By the time people are through, Zalasiewicz told me, he wouldnât be surprised if the earth were rendered more or less unrecognizable. âOne cannot exclude a P-T-type outcome,â he observed, referring to the worst of the so-called Big Five, the end-Permian, or Permo-Triassic, extinction. In the meantime, though, he said, âwe have to work with what weâve got.â\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThis past summer, I went with Zalasiewicz on another collecting trip, this one to Wales. Zalasiewicz has a special fondness for the country. He wrote his dissertation on the stratigraphy of northern Wales, and while finishing his research he drove around in a decommissioned postal van and lived in a camper that had been used as a chicken coop. He wanted to show me a spot near the town of Ponterwyd where he thought there should perhaps be another golden spikeâin this case, marking the base of the Aeronian Stage of the Silurian. We set out from the town of Keyworth, in Nottinghamshire, where Zalasiewicz lives with his wife and teen-age son, and drove through the West Midlands. In its day, the West Midlands was the industrial heart of Britain. Now the industry is mostly gone, and people struggle to find work. âAbout as scary an advertisement for the Anthropocene as you can imagineâ is how Zalasiewicz described the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we arrived at Ponterwyd, smirr was falling, or, as the Welsh put it, piglaw. Again, there were lots of sheep and green, sheep-shorn hills, and rocks filled with fossils. Banging away at an outcropping, I soon found several graptolites. One, which Zalasiewicz identified as belonging to the species _Monograptus triangulatus_, looked like a tiny saw blade, with miniature triangular teeth. With characteristic tact, he told me that my specimen was âvery lovely.â I stuck it in my bag.\n\n\n\nA few days later, I took the train back to London, and then the Tube out to Heathrow, where I was spending the night at an airport hotel. Thanks to all the graptolites Iâd gathered, my suitcase was overweight, and I decided that I was going to have to deaccession some of them. I took what seemed to be the least impressive examples and headed out through the lobby, only to realize that there was nowhere to go. The hotel faced a ten-foot wall, which was made of plywood and covered with billboard-size sheets of plastic printed with photographs of trees. The photos kept repeating, so that walking along was like getting lost in a dark monoculture. Beyond the plywood wall, there was a parking lot, and beyond that an access road. I figured that the parking lot would have to do. By this point, Iâd spent enough time with Zalasiewicz that the place appeared to me as a mosaic of human impacts. The lot was edged with a margin of dirt; this was filled with scraggly plants, many of them no doubt introduced species. Strewn among the weeds was the usual flotsam of travel: empty water bottles, crumpled candy wrappers, crushed soda cans, half-eaten packages of crisps. I recalled what Zalasiewicz had told me about aluminum, which is that until the late nineteenth century it did not exist on earth except in combination with other elements. So soda cans may provide yet another marker of our presence: the Dr Pepper spike.\n\n\n\nIt was a lovely evening. A half-moon hung in a purple sky crisscrossed by jet contrails. I took out my graptolites. Most I couldnât identify, but one, I thought, belonged to the species _Rhaphidograptus toernquisti_, which Zalasiewicz had described to me as among lifeâs great success stories. _Rhaphidograptus toernquisti_ managed to persist, unchanged, for some five million years. I placed my fossils in a little pile next to a discarded cigarette pack. Nearby, I noticed a plastic pouch with the word âToxicâ printed in block letters. The pouch was torn, and some ominously bright-yellow powder was leaking out of it. I tried to imagine a geologist in the year 100,000,000 A.D. stumbling onto the site. It was hard for me to picture what he (or it) would look like, but I got a certain satisfaction thinking about how puzzled he would be when he came upon my Silurian graptolites nestled amid the wreckage of the Anthropocene.Â â¦\n\n\n\n\n\n+++align-center\n\n_(This is the second part of a two-part article.)_\n\n+++","canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191016221108/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/12/23/the-lost-world-3","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c95e56e652c90274689","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Charles Darwin","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"charles-darwin"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environment"},{"id":"5c2e1d4341c92e2c9b85daea","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Evolution","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"evolution"},{"id":"5c2e1c93b75f002c8941e498","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fossils","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fossils"},{"id":"5c2e1ca92bfcc72cd92d056a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Geology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"geology"},{"id":"5c2e21de8c8f962cd419cc81","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Michael SoulÃ©","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"michael-soule"},{"id":"5c2e1ce541e4c73c088d780a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rats","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rats"},{"id":"5c2e1c7836cecf40192141c5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Science","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"science"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2396212cbb9fc99f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Subways","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"subways"},{"id":"5c2e1cbd22d4972cd5b832e9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trash","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trash"}],"sections":[{"id":"592df0c20223532785db7690","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Extinction","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-extinction"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03351c7a8e33fb390bec","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Elizabeth Kolbert has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1999.

The hotel is one of only three places that the Iranian leader could go in the city, because of U.S. sanctions. Macron intended to set up a three-way telephone conversation with Rouhani and [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump). A team of technicians arrived to set up a secure line, in a meeting room on Rouhaniâs floor, for the call at 9:30 *P*{:.small}.*M*{: .small}. The telephone conversation was supposed to cap twenty-four hours ofÂ [frenetic diplomacy](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/world-leaders-made-minute-push-trump-meet-iranian-65867282)âincluding personal appeals to Rouhani by the British, Japanese, and Pakistani Prime Ministers and the German Chancellorâafter months of quiet French diplomacy.\n\nEarlier in the day, Macron, alongside the British Prime Minister, [Boris Johnson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson), had urged Rouhani to talk with Trump. Their exchange was caughtÂ [on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovptmB8Fjkw). âIf he leaves the country without meeting President Trump, honestly, this is a lost opportunity,â Macron directed an interpreter to tell Rouhani, amid a scrum of diplomats and photographers. âBecause he will not come back in a few months and President Trump will not go to Tehran.â Rouhani threw his head back and laughed. âSo they have to meet now!â Macron insisted. Johnson chimed in, as cameras flashed, âYou need to be on the side of the swimming poolâand jump at the same time.â\n\nFor decades, timingâthe sequencing of diplomacy, and which side takes the plunge firstâhas derailed attempts to ease hostilities between Washington and Tehran. In 2013, President Obama dove first, during Rouhaniâs first visit as President to the U.N. General Assembly. He reached out to Rouhani in a telephone call. The two men never met in person, but the call led, after two years of tortuous diplomacy, to the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the worldâs six major powers. It was widely considered the most significant nonproliferation agreement in the world in more than a quarter century, even as all sides acknowledged its shortcomings. Trump abandoned it in May, 2018.\n\nRouhani, who has staked his Presidency on ending Iranâs tensions with the outside world over its nuclear program, is now a lame duck. The fate of his last major diplomatic gamble will almost surely impact Iranâs parliamentary elections next year and its Presidential election in 2021. In Iranâs deeply polarized politics, the nuclear deal has been as unpopular among the regimeâs hard-linersâfor concessions made by Iranâas it has been with Trumpâs advisersâfor concessions made by the United States.\n\nMacronâs mission in New York was to secure a verbal agreement from Trump and Rouhani on aÂ [four-point plan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-france-macron/macron-says-trump-rouhani-know-conditions-for-talks-but-up-to-them-to-deliver-idUSKBN1WA03Q)Â to jump-start diplomacyâand to avoid another Middle East war. Tensions have [escalated](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/does-trump-have-an-off-ramp-on-iran) since Trump reimposed sanctions this past November which were designed to cut off Iranâs oil exports. This summer, Iran and the U.S.Â [shot down each otherâs drones](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/may/08/timeline-tensions-between-trump-and-tehran); Trump called off U.S. military retaliation in the operationâs final minutes. Iran also threatened to cut off oil from other Persian Gulf countries if its main source of revenue were blocked. This month, Washington blamed Tehran for [an attack](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/in-saudi-arabia-world-oil-supplies-are-in-flames) on Saudi Arabiaâs oil facilities that temporarily severed five per cent of global oil supplies.\n\nMacron hoped that the telephone conversation would lay the groundwork for the first meeting between an American President and an Iranian President since Tehranâs 1979 revolution. Macronâs four-point plan covers Trumpâs demand for an expansion of the central terms and issues in the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran would pledge new talks on permanent restrictions on its nuclear program. The plan also addresses Iranâs demand that the United States lift the sanctions that were reimposed last year. And Tehran would be able to resume oil exports, which have plummeted from 3\\.2 million barrels per day in 2016 to below half a million barrels this summer. More broadly, the plan also incorporates regional flash points; Iran would help end the five-year war in Yemen and make pledges on security and freedom of navigation throughout the Persian Gulf.\n\nTrump has repeatedly signalled an interest in meeting Iranian leaders. During the previous two U.N. General Assembly meetings, in 2017 and 2018, he has conveyed secret messages, through the French, asking to meet Rouhani. In July, Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican and Trump golf partner, hand-carried [an invitation](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/irans-foreign-minister-invited-to-meet-trump-in-the-oval-office) to Iranâs Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to visit the White Houseâthat very week. In late August, during the G-7 summit in Biarritz, Trump asked Macron to set up a meeting with Zarif, who was holding talks nearby with French officials. At the U.N. last week, Trump expressed his interest to reporters. âTheyâre here, weâre here, but we have not agreed to that yet,â heÂ [said](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/sep/24/trump-iran-united-nations). âBut they would like to negotiate. And it would certainly make sense.â\n\nThe Iranians, however, donât trust Trump. Four days before Trump arrived in New York, the Administration added another layer of sanctions, this time on Iranâs Central Bank. âWeâve never done it at this level,â Trump [boasted](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/sep/20/us-sanctions-iran%E2%80%99s-central-bank)Â toÂ reporters, in the Oval Office. âItâs too bad whatâs happening with Iran. Itâs going to hell. They are broke, and they could solve the problem very easily.â \n\nThis year, the Trump Administration has imposed at leastÂ [sixteen new rounds of sanctions](http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/timeline-us-sanctions)Â on Iran, beyond those reimposed last year. Some are unprecedentedâincluding those against the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, everyone in his office, the entire Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Zarif. The United States has also at least twice launched secret cyberattacks against Iran.\n\nAfter every Trump overture, Rouhani and Zarif have responded that the United States must first publicly promise to lift sanctions. RouhaniÂ [said](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-weird-whoppers-at-the-g-7-summit)Â last month that he was not interested in the type of flashy summit that Trump had with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. âIf someone intends to make it as just a photo op with Rouhani, that is not possible,â Rouhani said, in a televised address. The Iranians also preferred that any encounter include the other signatories of the 2015 pactâBritain, China, France, Germany, and Russia. \n\nTrumpâs speech to the U.N. last week didnât foster trust, either. âNo responsible government should subsidize Iranâs bloodlust,â heÂ [declared](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/sep/24/trump-iran-united-nations). âAs long as Iranâs menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be liftedâthey will be tightened. Iranâs leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another cautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power and riches.â The same day, Rudy Giuliani, the Presidentâs personal lawyer, was the keynote speaker at an event organized by the Iranian opposition. âI am for regime change,â heÂ [told](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/giuliani-says-i-am-for-regime-change-in-iran/30182912.html)Â protesters gathered near the U.N. headquarters. âDown with the tyrants in Iran. Down with the Ayatollah and the mullahs and all the crooks.â \n\nBy the end of Tuesday, Rouhani was in no mood to believe that Trump would take the first step and promise to lift sanctions. When Macron showed up, Rouhani had already retreated to his bedroom. âThis was just a game to get us to a meeting without any assurances that Trump would deliver,â Zarif later told me.\n\nThe call to Trumpâs line came through at nine-thirty, according to sources familiar with events that evening. Macron took the call. But Rouhani never emerged from his room. âAs we have been doing for several months, we worked in New York to get Iran to make new commitments and for the U.S., in exchange, to ease sanctions,â a French diplomat told me. âWe made technical arrangements in the event that a telephone call could take place. That call did not take place.â The next day, TrumpÂ [banned](http://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/sep/25/us-bans-iranian-officials-and-families)Â Iranian officials and their families from the United States. \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nDiplomacy may not be dead, however. French officials told me that Macron would continue pushing his plan. On Wednesday, Rouhani addressed Trump directly in [his speech](http://www.president.ir/en/111465) toÂ the U.N. âStop the sanctions so as to open the way for the start of negotiations,â he said. âIf you require more, you should also give more.â He added, âA memorial photo is the last step of negotiation, not the first one.â\n\nOn Thursday, Rouhani told a press conference that Tehran is prepared to negotiate beyond the terms of the 2015 agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. âWhat we believe in is that the J.C.P.O.A. is not a maximum form of agreement. It is what was possible at its time,â he said. âNow, if we wish to take a step above and beyond the J.C.P.O.A., that is possible. But the proper foundation would lie upon the full and exact implementation of the J.C.P.O.A. firstââmeaning lifting sanctions.\n\nRouhani flew home later that day. Yet again, the United States and Iran had opposite impressions of what went wrong. At the Tehran airport, Rouhani told reporters that he had been assured by the British, French, and German leaders that Trump was ready to negotiateâand to promise to lift sanctions, to start the process. After Rouhaniâs comments were reported, Trump denied it. âIran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet,â TrumpÂ [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1177574382056693760). âI said, of course,

By May 12th, President Trump will decide whether to kick it into the abyss. He hates it. âThe worst deal Iâve ever seen,â he [told Fox News](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/5/14516156/donald-trump-interview-transcript-bill-oreilly-super-bowl-2017), in an interview for the 2017 Super Bowl. âIt was a deal that should never have been negotiated.â The worldâs five other major powersâBritain, China, France, Germany, and Russiaâwere equal parties to the accord. The United Nations Security Council unanimously endorsed it, as did the twenty-eight nations of the European Union. But the United States was the decisive voice during the two years of diplomacy that went into the dealâs signing, in 2015, and it will be decisive in its fate now.\n\nTrump could kill the deal by deciding not to comply with U.S. obligationsânamely, the waiving of sanctions, which was promised in exchange for Iran limiting its controversial nuclear program. The President could also walk away from the deal altogether, even though the five other powers are still wedded to it. His Administration apparently calculates that Iran will stick to the terms, whatever Washington does. Iranâs foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told me otherwise. âIf they want to kill the deal, they have that option, but they have to face the consequences,â Zarif said. âItâs dangerous to be arrogant, very dangerous.â For fifteen months, he added, Trump has already tried to sabotage the accord by disrupting normal business with Iran.\n\nZarif, who completed his doctorate at the University of Denverâs Josef Korbel School of International Studies, is spending six days in New York; heâs technically on U.N. business, but is also speaking  with members of Congress, the U.S. foreign-policy community, and the media. I met with him three times, and he seemed intent on trying to salvage the accord. âItâs important for Iran to receive the benefits of the agreement,â he said. \n\nTehran has three broad choices if Trump opts out, according to Zarif. In the first, Iran could withdraw from the deal, terminate compliance, and resumeâeven increaseâits uranium enrichment, which produces fuel that can be used in either a nuclear-energy program or the worldâs deadliest weapon. Despite its vast oil reserves, the country is keen to harness nuclear power, which could diversify energy sources for a burgeoning population, conserve resources for export, and accelerate modern development. âAmerica never should have feared Iran producing a nuclear bomb,â Zarif said. âBut we will pursue vigorously our nuclear enrichment.â \n\nIran once had the capacity to enrich uranium at twenty per cent, a level that far exceeds the basic needs for an energy program. As is, the deal limits Iran to roughly 3.7-per-cent enrichment. (The U.S., along with the five other major powers, argued that Iran did not need a higher capacity if, as it claimed, it only wanted enriched uranium for nuclear energy.) The U.N.âs nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, in the toughest inspections ever imposed on any country, has repeatedly certified Iranâs compliance. \n\nIranâs second option exploits a dispute mechanism in the deal, which allows any party to file a formal complaint with a commission established to adjudicate violations. Iran has filed eleven complaintsâto Federica Mogherini, the E.U.âs foreign-policy chief, who heads the commissionâciting U.S. violations on three different counts, Zarif said. The process allows forty-five days for resolution. âThe objective of the process is to bring the United States into compliance,â Zarif said. \n\nBritain, France, and Germany, the three European powers party to the deal, have already been trying to achieve that objective. Since January, they have brokered quiet negotiations through the State Department to address Trumpâs objections but save the accord. Those objections, backed by many in Congress, involve concerns about the scope of inspections, future tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and so-called sunset clauses, which would eventually allow Iran to resume sensitive activities.\n\nThe European effort has reached its final stages, with agreement on most issues except sunset clauses. As part of the effort, the Europeans are also trying to win a guarantee from the White House that it will not impede Iranâs international businessâa hard sell, according to European officials. The French President, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to press the case further with Trump during his three-day state visit, which begins Monday, diplomats told me. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, due in town on Friday, will follow suit, and the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will make her case by phone.\n\nBut Zarif said any compromise that adds new conditions or interpretations was a non-starter. âWe donât condone it, and we donât believe itâs useful or fruitful or conducive to a better implementation of the [deal], and they know that to be our position,â Zarif said. âThe only scenario that we can deal with is for the Europeans to talk to the Trump Administration to start, once and for all, complying with the deal.â\n\nIranâs third option is the most drastic: the country could decide to walk away from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or N.P.T., [the landmark agreement](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/) now signed by a hundred and ninety-one nations. The treaty, enacted in 1970, seeks to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and foster the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The crisis surrounding Iranâs program began in 2003, when the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Tehran failed to meet its obligations under the N.P.T., specifically in declaring its uranium-enrichment program.\n\nIn Tehran, debate is still intense about which option Iran should choose. âIran is not a monolith,â Zarif said. But he noted that the publicâs mood had shifted over the past year. Distrust is deeper. âThe United States has not only failed to implement its side but is even asking for more,â he said. âThatâs a very dangerous message to send to the people of Iran, but also to the people of the worldâthat you should never come to an agreement with the United States, because, at the end of the day, the operating principle for the United States is âwhatâs mine is mine, whatâs yours is negotiable.â â\n\nI asked Zarif if there was a prospect, if the deal dies, that Iran would negotiate again with the United States. âDiplomacy never dies,â he told me. âBut it doesnât mean that there is only one avenue for diplomacy, and that is the United States.â Whatever Iranâs final decision, he said, it âwonât be very pleasant to the United States. That I can say. Thatâs a consensus.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1cc52710c62d10815499","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nuclear Weapons","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nuclear-weapons"},{"id":"5c2e1c77397f5b30646d05e6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"United Nations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"united-nations"},{"id":"5c2e1c9a2bc86f2c9a2449dc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"European Union","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"european-union"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

Now, many fear that the Trump Administration may be on the verge of a military strike on the country. Tensions with Iran began escalating rapidly in April, when Trump announced that he was designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization and imposed more sanctions. Last Thursday, two tankers, one Japanese, the other Norwegian, exploded in the Gulf of Oman. The Trump Administration quickly blamed Iran for the attacks, and for attacks on four other tankers in the same area on May 12th. Then, on Monday, Iran [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/middleeast/100000006562480/iran-uranium.html) that it was likely to breach the nuclear deal by keeping more uranium stockpiled than is allowed by the agreement, as the U.S. prepared to send a thousand more troops to the region.\n\nTo talk about the state of U.S.-Iranian relations, I spoke by phone with Wendy R. Sherman, the lead American negotiator on the nuclear agreement, and a former State Department ambassador. She is currently the director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School, and the author of â[Not for the Faint of Heart: Lessons in Courage, Power, and Persistence](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Faint-Heart-Lessons-Persistence/dp/156858816X/).â During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the risks of escalating tensions, why Trump has taken such distinct approaches to Iran and North Korea, and the difference between hard-liners and hard-hard-liners in both the U.S. and [Iran](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/iran). \n\n__Do you have a view other than agnosticism on who was behind these tanker attacks?__\n\nI have not seen the intelligence myself, so it is very hard to definitely say what occurred here. Nonetheless, the fact that the chair of the House Intelligence Committee [Adam Schiff] has publicly [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-rep-adam-schiff-on-face-the-nation-june-16-2019/) that he believes the intelligence is conclusive is certainly an important data point. I think the real issue here is not only what happened but why did it happen, what will be the response to it happening, and is this part of an escalatory cycle that was begun by the Trump Administration when the President withdrew from the J.C.P.O.A. [the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran deal is officially known]?\n\n__What is your sense of American policy toward Iran right now? Do you see any rhyme or reason, or anything that could even be called strategic belligerence?__\n\nI do not think there is a coherent policy or strategy regarding Iran. I think President Trump made a commitment during the campaign to withdraw from the deal. His then [team] all believed he should not. When they all departed, his new team supported his withdrawing from the deal. Within that new team, I would say we have the never-saw-a-war-he-didnât-want-to wage national-security adviser, [John Bolton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/john-bolton-on-the-warpath). We have a chief of staff, [Mick Mulvaney](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/mick-mulvaney-cant-save-donald-trump-from-his-own-actions-and-lies), who pretty much endorses everything the President says. We have an acting Secretary of Defense [Patrick Shanahan, who withdrew from the confirmation process on Tuesday] who clearly doesnât have a voice in this Administration, it appears. And we have a Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo] who may think he is trying to bring nuance to this policy, but seems to be pursuing a path which, either intentionally or by accident, may take us to war.\n\n__Maybe I am picking up on something that is not there, but I thought you sort of described Pompeo as thinking of himself as a voice of moderation or compromise. Is that based on something you have heard?__\n\nI think âmoderationâ is too strong a word. I think Secretary Pompeo may believe that he is talking with all of the allies and partners, and trying to make sure everyone is aware of the intelligence. But there is no question that he has become what I call a hard-hard-liner, and not a hard-liner. We are all at some level hard-liners when it comes to Iran. Nobody wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And nobody wants Iran to continue malign or nefarious behavior in the region or in the world, or human-rights abuses, or its state sponsorship of terrorism. But the hard-hard-liners are on the ascent in the Trump Administration, and hard-hard-liners are certainly on the ascent in Iran. And that has created a virtual symbiosis where the hard-hard-liners in each of these spheres have ramped up an escalatory and very dangerous cycle.\n\n__One concern among opponents of the Trump Administration was that by ramping up sanctions and being more aggressive, the United States would only embolden Iranian hard-liners. What have you seen that suggests that has already occurred?__\n\nThink of it this way: it is actually rather extraordinary that, even in the face of the Trump Administration withdrawing from the deal, and the reimposition of sanctions, and the ramping up of pressure, Iran has stayed compliant with the deal. But the Supreme Leader of Iran has always understood that for his survival, he needs to balance the forces in his country. And there are hard-line forcesâI would probably call President [Hassan] Rouhani a hard-linerâand there are hard-hard-linersâthe I.R.G.C. and the Quds Force. And clearly the hard-hard-liners are in the ascendancy, because they have said, âEnough already. Being part of this deal has gotten us more sanctions, more pressure. We have gotten nothing out of this. We told you all along that the deal was a bad deal.â The I.R.G.C. never wanted this deal. They owned the black market. They owned the Iranian economy. They would like to go back to those good old days. They want freedom of action in the Middle East. Apparently, they have it. On the day the Prime Minister of Japan was in Tehran, if the intelligence is accurateâand, as I said, I havenât read it, so I donât knowâthey attacked a Japanese tanker.\n\n__You are saying that even people like yourself in the Obama Administration who wanted a nuclear deal and people like Rouhani, who, in the American press, is generally called a moderate, are hard-liners. Everyone is a hard-liner. Is that accurate?__\n\nI donât think that President Rouhani is moderate in American terms. He is a very conservative cleric. He believes in the theocracy of Iran; he is a product of it. And he is a hard-liner. People would call me a moderate in U.S. terms, because I was willing to negotiate with Iran under the direction of President Obama and Secretary [John] Kerry, but I am in my own way a hard-liner, because I believe Iran should not have a nuclear weapon. It should stop locking up Americans in [Evin Prison](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/jason-rezaian-on-imprisonment-in-iran). It should stop its state sponsorship of terrorism. And it should stop its human-rights abuses of its own people.\n\n__Right, I just meant that itâs interesting that we are at a place where there are really no dovesâ__\n\nI am more of a dove when it comes to finding the strategy and the tactics that can address these issues peacefully, as opposed to war. That is not to say I am a pacifist. I am not. There are times when war is the last and only result. But what we are experiencing right now is an escalatory cycle between the hard-hard-liners in each of our countries. They are spinning each other up on a path that could lead us to a war that is unnecessary, in my view, and will be horribly destructive.\n\n__What is the specific meaning to Iran keeping more of its uranium? How important a component was that of the deal?__\n\nItâs a very important component. The restrictions that were put in place include that, for fifteen years, Iran cannot enrich above 3\\.67 per cent, nor have a stockpile of 3.67-per-cent-enriched uranium of more than three hundred kilograms. One cannot make a nuclear bomb with those restrictions. There are restrictions that go on for twenty and twenty-five years and forever that also will make it very difficult for Iran to get a nuclear weapon. But, for those first fifteen years, those two requirements are quite profound. \n\nSo if Iran begins to enrich above 3\\.67 per cent, it has violated the agreement. It means that Iran, in its own way, is withdrawing from the agreement. It will then put pressure on the Europeans to both fully enforce sanctions and impose new ones. It will probably create a crisis at the U.N. Security Council. It will probably create a circumstance where the U.S. feels it needs to take additional action. And even before that, in some quarters, my understanding is that there is discussion of taking a strike in retaliation for the tankers, to act as a deterrent to insure that the Strait of Hormuz is open. I think there are many ways to deal with that, and I would hope that the Administration would be extremely careful about any military action.\n\n__What specifically have you heard about this?__\n\nI think Iâd rather not say.\n\n__What did you learn about Iranâs government from the nuclear negotiations that you were surprised by, or that is helpful when thinking through this current crisis?__\n\nIâm not sure âsurprisedâ is the right word. I probably came to understand more. Iran is a culture of resistance. They will resist coming to the negotiating table unless and until President Trump puts something on the table for them. You may recall that in the case of North Korea the President put on the table stopping exercises in South Korea. The Iranians will not capitulate in any way, shape, or form. They lived with the Iran-Iraq War, with chemical attacks on their own people. It took a long time to find a way through that. \n\nSecond, they are a country with politics. Most Americans hear âSupreme Leaderâ and they think he tells everyone what to do and thatâs it. But that is not true. The Supreme Leader balances a number of political forces, including the hard-liners and the hard-hard-liners. And so you constantly see this back-and-forth of trying to manage the politics and the various forces in his country. Yes, he has a lot of control. Yes, people donât get to run for President in Iran unless a slate is agreed to by the Supreme Leader and the Guardian Council. But, that said, there are still politics in Iran.\n\nAnd Iran is all of the things people say. I have no trust in Iran, and Iran has no trust in me. We may have gained some mutual respect and understanding through the negotiations, but there is no trust. And Iran does a lot of bad things in the world. But, for the life of me, if the current President of the United States does not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, I do not understand why he withdrew from a deal that was keeping them from getting nuclear weapons. \n\n__How has Iranâs behavior in the region changed or not changed over the past yearâspecifically in the time since Trump announced he was pulling out of the nuclear deal?__\n\nI see them doing more, not less in the region. Sometimes that is through proxiesâin Yemen, in Syria, even in Afghanistanâbut Iran is very active in the region. And more so than at the time that the deal was agreed. Thatâs my perception certainly.\n\n__Given that we have a President who insists on doing things his own way, and that way often has to do with flattery and meeting people face-to-face, do you see any hope of high-level meetings, or something like North Korea, where some sort of negotiation can keep the lid on things after a lot of belligerence, even if we donât see any sign of a long-term solution?__\n\nThere is a possibility, but President Trump would have to put something on the table, as he did in the North Korean situation. There is a sense of no respect by the President of the United States for Iran. It is a very different situation than North Korea. I think I will not be the first person to remind you that one of the reasons that President Trump took on North Korea was that Barack Obama had not. We took it on, but not in a way that got to a solution. And he wanted to withdraw from the Iran deal because Obama had done it. I am always open to unconventional ways to negotiate, but they have to come with a strategy, a plan, a team, and a way to execute that plan, and a way to consult with others in the world to insure the durability of what you are trying to do. And I donât see that here.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1dad22d4972cd5b833d0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hassan Rouhani","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hassan-rouhani"},{"id":"5c2e1fda397f5b30646d08c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nuclear Deal","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nuclear-deal"}],"sections":[{"id":"5c66cf8d715e6a5a5a904371","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Q. & A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"q-and-a"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5fcdd6207318b5db81f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Isaac Chotiner is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*, where he is the principal contributor to [Q.&nbsp;&&nbsp;A.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a), a series of timely interviews with major public figures in politics, media, books, business, technology, and more.

According to Justice Department officials and the whistle-blower complaint about [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)âs phone call with the Ukrainian President, Barr knew of Trumpâs effort to get Ukraine to interfere in the [2020 election](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/2020-election) by investigating a possible rival, former Vice-President [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), and of the Departmentâs subsequent suppression of the whistle-blower complaint. On Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Barr of being part of a âcoverup of the coverup,â and signalled that the Attorney General will be a focus of the investigation. âI do think the Attorney General has gone rogueâhe has for a long time now,â Pelosi told CNN. âAnd, since he was mentioned in all of this, itâs curious that he would be making decisions about how the complaint would be handled.â\n\nThe record of Barrâs Justice Department supports Pelosiâs assessment. When the complaint arrived at the Department, the Office of Legal Counsel ruled that it was not an âurgent concernââa decision questioned by Democratsâand therefore should not be handed over to Congress. And then, in a more surprising move, the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division declined to investigate the whistle-blowerâs allegation that the President had engaged in criminal conduct. Department officials played down Barrâs role, saying that he was âgenerally knowledgeableâ of discussions about the O.L.C. decision to find the complaint not urgent, but was not involved in the Criminal Divisionâs decision to decline to investigate the allegation. They also maintain that the Departmentâs decisions about the complaint were based on legal considerations, not political ones.\n\nThe distinction between legal and political considerations in these cases, though, is not so simple. Both the O.L.C. and the Criminal Division are led by Trump appointees, who, like Barr, are generally defenders of the power of Presidents to act unilaterally and limit congressional involvement. [Human-rights groups](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/07/groups-express-concern-over-us-office-legal-counsel-nominee) questioned the role of Steven Engel, the head of the O.L.C., in the drafting of a 2007 Justice Department legal memo that authorized the use of interrogation techniquesâsuch as sleep deprivation for up to ninety-six hours and forcing detainees to wear diapersâthat are widely considered torture. Brian Benczkowski, who leads the Criminal Division, has been [criticized by Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/after-more-than-a-year-senate-confirms-nominee-to-lead-justice-department-criminal-division/2018/07/11/53fc96ac-839f-11e8-8f6c-46cb43e3f306_story.html) for having little experience prosecuting cases and close political ties to Trumpâs former Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and other conservative Republicans.\n\nMary McCord, a former senior Justice Department official and a professor at Georgetown Law School, questioned the Criminal Divisionâs decision not to investigate. âI find it very surprising that Justice Department lawyers would find that thereâs nothing here worth exploring,â McCord, who led the Departmentâs National Security Division from 2016 to 2017, told me. McCord, who has also prosecuted government officials on corruption charges, added that a request from Trump to Ukraine for interference in the 2020 election did not, as some Republicans have maintained, need to be explicit. âItâs ridiculous to expect that youâre going to see that kind of language,â she said. âItâs what you see in other corruption cases. You see these kinds of somewhat guarded language.â\n\nRichard Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who specializes in election law, [told](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-rejected-investigation-of-trump-phone-call-just-weeks-after-it-began-examining-the-matter/2019/09/25/6f7977ce-dfb5-11e9-8dc8-498eabc129a0_story.html) the Washington *Post* last week that the Criminal Divisionâs failure to investigate the case was âlaughable.â He criticized the Criminal Divisionâs finding that the value of a Ukrainian government investigation of Biden could not be quantified and therefore could not be investigated as a possible campaign-finance-law violation. âYouâre talking about information on a potential rival that could be used in a presidential campaign, a presidential campaign which likely would run into the billions of dollars,â Hasen said. âI donât think thereâs any question that a prosecutor could go forward with the theory.â\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBarr, who served in his current role previously, under George&nbsp;H.&nbsp;W. Bush, is only the second American to have served twice as Attorney General. When he replaced Sessions, in February, 2019, he was seen as a skilled lawyer and experienced Washington hand who could act as a restraining influence on Trump. Since he took office, however, Barr has become one of Trumpâs closest aides and the [focus of complaints](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/09/25/william-barrs-role-is-about-get-lot-more-scrutiny/) that he is the most politicized Attorney General in decades. Critics accuse him of repeatedly using his authority to benefit the President politically, helping Trump mount an unprecedented assault on Congressâs oversight of the executive branch and the President.\n\nFirst, in March, Barr produced a misleading summary of the special counsel Robert Muellerâs final report on the Russia investigation, in which Barr cleared the President of wrongdoing. âI have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counselâs investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,â Barr wrote. Mueller, in fact, had found ten potential episodes of obstruction of justice, but left it up to Congress to decide whether Trump was guilty. When congressional Democrats tried to investigate the potential acts of obstruction by subpoenaing the Trump aides who witnessed it, Barrâs Justice Department issued a legal opinion that the staffers were not required to testify before Congress.\n\nIn recent months, Barr has amplified Trumpâs threats to law-enforcement and intelligence officials. During congressional testimony in April, Barr said that the F.B.I. may have spied on Trump, giving credence to conspiracy theories spread by the President that the F.B.I. had improperly wiretapped Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, a claim flatly denied by F.B.I. officials. âSpying on a political campaign is a big deal,â Barr told senators. âI think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.â A month later, Trump announced that Barr was carrying out a sweeping investigation of the origins of the F.B.I.âs Trump-Russia investigation. Democrats said that Barrâs actions sent a message to law-enforcement and intelligence officials that they would face retaliation if they investigated Trump.\n\nThe Ukraine phone call sets another precedent. In his conversation with the Ukrainian President, [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/volodymyr-zelensky), Trump said that Barr was a participant in the Presidentâs effort to get Ukraine to investigate Biden. Trump, of course, could have been lying to Zelensky. Trump also may never have followed up with Barr after the call. Either way, the President has smeared Barr and fuelled calls for the Attorney General to be investigated. Barr, who claims he never spoke with Trump about Zelensky, now faces a decision. Will he uphold his own reputation or that of the President, who is impugning him?\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nBarr might recall the example of John Mitchell, who, in 1975, became the firstâand onlyâformer Attorney General of the United States to be sent to prison. Mitchell served as Richard Nixonâs Attorney General from 1969 to 1972, and then as chairman of Nixonâs 1972 Presidential reÃ«lection campaign. As campaign chairman, he oversaw the Watergate break-ins and then participated in the coverup. Unlike other aides who broke with Nixon and implicated the President, Mitchell declined to reveal his conversations with the President. He was convicted by a jury of his peers of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and perjury for his role in Watergate. Mitchell served nineteen months in federal prison before being released, for medical reasons.\n\nFor many in the American legal community, though, Mitchellâs actions before Watergate were more troubling. While serving as Attorney General, Mitchell hatched secretâand, at times, bizarreâplots to aid Nixon politically. He investigated government officials and journalists suspected of leaking damaging information about the President. He prosecuted opponents of the Vietnam War. And he controlled a secret slush fund used to smear Democratic Presidential candidates deemed a threat to Nixon. In one simultaneously abhorrent and amateurish act, Mitchell approved a payment of ten thousand dollars to a faction of the American Nazi Party in order to carry out a failed effort to remove Governor George Wallace from a Presidential ballot in California. Nixon aides believed that supporters of Wallaceâan avowed segregationist running as a third-party candidateâwould shift their votes to Nixon. \n\nJudges later found Mitchellâs actions, such as wiretapping Americans without court orders, to be not only illegal but unconstitutional. He had used his powers as Attorney General to harass and smear Americans engaged in constitutionally protected political activityâfrom leading Democratic politicians to street protesters. After Nixon resigned and Mitchell was sent to prison, an elaborate series of norms and rules was established to prevent the President from acting like an authoritarian rulerâand the Attorney General from acting like the Presidentâs personal lawyer.\n\nSince Mitchell, Attorneys General have also worked to restore public faith in the independence of the Justice Department. Edward Levi, a conservative legal scholar whom Gerald Ford appointed as the first post-Watergate Attorney General, was hailed by both political parties for restoring neutrality and integrity to the office. In an attempt to cement Leviâs legacy, multiple Republican and Democratic Attorneys General have recused themselves from investigations involving the Presidents who appointed them. During the Clinton Administration, Janet Reno recused herself from the Whitewater investigation, which led to Clintonâs impeachment. During the George W. Bush Administration, Attorneys General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales both recused themselves from an investigation of the leak of the C.I.A. agent Valerie Plameâs identity. Barr has an opportunity to do the same and recuse himself from the Trump-Ukraine investigationâto show that he represents the best interests of the American people, not those of Donald Trump. So far, he has declined to do so.\n  \n*A previous version of this article mischaracterized a Justice Department legal memo from 2007 that authorized interrogation techniques.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c93e56e652c90274687","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"William Barr","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"william-barr"},{"id":"5c2e1d774a08312cd3aa6d2d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Attorney General","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"attorney-general"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

The occasion was the release of â[The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/download-report/),â a major scientific report by the U.N.âs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that human activities have made the oceans increasingly inhospitable to marine life and have caused glacial melt and sea-level rise to happen at an even faster rate than scientists had previously projected. The effectsâalready well under way, with some locked in over the next centuryâpose an immediate threat to the survival of certain island nations and high-alpine communities, as well as hundreds of millions of other coastal inhabitants and many of the worldâs fisheries. âThe reason we have taken to the streets is because of science,â Thunberg said, after thanking the U.N. scientists who authored the report. âThis is about an existential crisis for the biosphere and for humanity.â On the projection screen behind her was a seal stranded on a tiny iceberg in a big blue ocean. âOur main enemy now is physics. We can still fix this, it is still possible, but not if we continue like now.â She concluded, âWe must listen to the scientists.â\n\nThe report, which is based on nearly seven thousand peer-reviewed studies, was prepared and written by a hundred and four scientists from thirty-six countries. It was the latest addition in a dire trilogy of I.P.C.C. special reports, which previously included studies on the extreme risks of even [1\\.5 degrees Celsius of warming](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dire-warnings-of-the-united-nations-latest-climate-change-report) and on the impacts of [climate change on land](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/deforestation-agriculture-and-diet-are-fuelling-the-climate-crisis). (Additionally, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, a U.N.-backed body, released a report in May on [the accelerating rate of widespread extinction](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/climate-change-and-the-new-age-of-extinction) across species.) Wednesdayâs report took a similarly comprehensive approach to studying climate changeâs impact on ice formations, sea level, and the planetâs oceans.\n\nâThe ocean today is higher, warmer, more acidic, less productive, and it holds less oxygen,â Jane Lubchenco, a former administrator of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said. As a result, coral reefs are bleaching a ghostly white, and, although some can recover, others are dying at a rapid rate. Monster storms are persistent. Marine heat wavesâprojected to increase fiftyfold if current trends continueâare depleting fisheries. Ocean acidification is severely harming all sorts of species, which then harms people, too, since many of these species are critical to local economies. Glaciers are melting faster with consequences for people in the mountains and on the coasts alike. On Tuesday, just two hundred and sixty miles from Monaco, where I.P.C.C. scientists and government representatives were negotiating the reportâs final language, Italian authorities in the town of Courmayeur closed roads and evacuated homes after warning that the Mont Blanc glacier was on the brink of [collapse](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/25/mont-blanc-glacier-in-danger-of-collapse-experts-warn). âThis phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors, therefore it is particularly vulnerable,â the townâs mayor said.\n\nOne major new development in the report is the elevation of the coastal-flood risk. By 2050, in many places globally, the current hundred-year flood will occur every year, even if we cut emissions to the lowest levels considered achievable, putting megacities (with populations greater than ten million), including Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok, Surabaya, and parts of Los Angeles, at serious risk.  For some areas, the hundred-year-flood level is not much higher than the current water level, meaning it may be a more manageable problem. For other areas, the hundred-year level is a couple of feet above high tide. These places will require either very expensive adaptation measures or abandonment. âIf the hundred-year event turns into an annual event, that means the three-hundred-year, five-hundred-year, and currently less frequent events also occur more often,â Michael Oppenheimer, one of the reportâs authors and a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University, said. âOn small islands, a couple feet is the difference between existing and non-existing.â\n\nAccording to the report, by 2100, even in the best-case emissions scenarioâmeaning we surpass the targets of the Paris Agreementâthe global mean sea level will still rise by about one and a half feet, relative to its average levels at the turn of this century. If we continue emitting greenhouse gases at current rates, however, it could rise much more rapidly, reaching nearly three feet of sea-level rise by 2100 (and an unimaginable eighteen feet over the next few centuries). These, of course, are global averages; along certain coasts, owing to sinking lands from human development, as well as other geologic causes, sea-level rise will be higher. âThe ocean is already rising, rising faster than we had predicted, it will continue to rise, and that only serves to underscore the emergency we are confronted with now, the urgency of reducing carbon emissions as rapidly as possible,â Lubchenco, the former *NOAA*{: .small} administrator, said.\n\nThe rise will come primarily from the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Theories about the potential for warming to destabilize Antarcticaâs ice were first posed in the late seventies by an eccentric glaciologist from Ohio State University named [John Mercer](https://climatecrocks.com/2014/05/27/john-mercer-antarctic-eccentric-now-seen-as-prophetic/). In 1978, he [published a paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/271321a0) in *Nature* called the âWest Antarctic Ice Sheet and CO~2~ Greenhouse Effect: A Threat of Disaster.â He predicted that the warming atmosphere could melt the ice sheet from underneath, causing sections to rapidly break away and raise sea levels. He was labelled an alarmist, and had difficulty finding research funding in the years that followed. Even in 1990, many scientists still believed that the ice sheet in Antarctica would be stable for thousands of years, even with large amounts of warming. Today scientists are clear that Mercer was right.\n\nThe deliberations in Monaco took place while more than four million people [took to the streets](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/new-yorks-climate-strike-and-the-things-that-make-teen-agers-march) globally, led by [Thunberg and young students](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-faces-of-young-protesters-at-new-york-citys-climate-strike), in [the largest climate protest](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/new-yorks-original-teen-age-climate-striker-alexandria-villasenor-greta-thunberg) in history, on Friday, and then heads of state met at the United Nations, for the so-called Climate Action Summit, convened by Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, on Monday. The summit resulted in little promise of action. [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) made a brief visit, and listened to remarks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, of India, and Chancellor Angela Merkel, of Germanyâbut skipped the rest, including an [electrifying speech](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/greta-thunberg-is-the-anti-trump) by Thunberg in which she, yet again, called out the unforgivable behavior of the worldâs leaders in failing to make the changes that scientists say we need. A summit attendee posted a video, which immediately went viral, showing Trumpâs arrival, with Mike Pence in tow and Thunberg behind both of them, glaring at their backs. \n\nLisa Speer, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Councilâs International Oceans Program, was in Monaco. âSitting through this meeting was alternately incredibly tedious, riveting, and profoundly depressing,â she told me. âWhen they were talking about these really harrowing effects, I couldnât help but think, Weâre all going to be in the *cry*osphere.â She laughed. âYou need a little humor to get through it.â She noted the linkages that this report establishesâhow ice melt sends increasing amounts of freshwater into the ocean, causing a phenomenon of layering, or stratification, in which the freshwater acts as a kind of lid, preventing the ocean from maintaining the oxygen levels that marine life needs to survive. Or how the warming ocean causes more intense storms, and how the rising ocean causes the impact from storm surge to have that much more power to do damage.\n\nDespite the grim picture, there is still time to stop emissions and prevent the kind of annihilating sea-level rise and species extinction from which there is no recovery. Another major report, released this week by the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (consisting of heads of government from fourteen countries), and written by a group of experts and scientists, laid out the oceanâs vast potential for mitigating climate change. The solutions it put forth could provide up to a fifth of the emissions cuts needed by 2050 in order to keep global temperature rise below 1\\.5 degrees Celsius. They offered five areas: offshore renewable energy (primarily wind, as well as floating solar, wave, and tidal power); ocean-based transport-efficiency measures (better hull design, and the decarbonization of coastal ferry fleets and ports); marine conservation and restoration of ocean-based carbon sinks (mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes); improved reliance on fisheries (through better management of wild stocks, the expansion of sustainable aquaculture, and dietary shifts to low-carbon marine foods, including seaweed, kelp, and shellfish); and, most controversially, the unproved potential of carbon storage in the seabed. But, as Wednesdayâs I.P.C.C. report makes clear, the window for implementing any of these solutions is closing fast. âThe risk is growing faster than our current ability to handle the situation,â Michael Oppenheimer told me. âIt may become unmanageable over coming decades, so time is of the essence.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate

Thunberg, who is sometimes compared to Joan of Arc and sometimes to Pippi Longstocking, doesnât flyâthe emissions from aviation are too highâso sheâd spent two weeks sailing across the Atlantic in a racing boat. When she reached New York Harbor, she told Trevor Noah, on âThe Daily Show,â the first thing she noticed was âSuddenly, it smells.â\n\nThunberg doesnât adhere to social niceties. (Sheâs spoken openly about having Aspergerâs syndrome.) She began her crusade last year, sitting outside the Swedish parliament building, in Stockholm, handing out flyers that read âI am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.â Itâs a trait particularly well suited to the cause sheâs taken up: on no other issue is the gap between whatâs politically acceptable and whatâs scientifically necessary wider than it is on climate change. In an address to the French parliament, in July, Thunberg put it this way: âMaybe you are simply not mature enough to tell it like it is, because even that burden you leave to us children. We become the bad guys who have to tell people these uncomfortable things, because no one else wants to, or dares to.â\n\nThunberg had come to New York to address world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit. The summitâs stated goal is to ârapidly accelerate action to implement the Paris Agreement,â which was negotiated in 2015\\. Under the [Paris Agreement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-the-paris-climate-agreement-means-for-vulnerable-nations), just about every country on earth pledged to hold âthe increase in the global average temperature to well below 2Â°Câ (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and to try to hold it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But, as Thunberg patiently explained on âThe Daily Show,â citing last yearâs special report of the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-dire-warnings-of-the-united-nations-latest-climate-change-report), the window for meeting these targets is closing fast. To have a two-thirds chance of holding the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the signatories of the Paris Agreement would, collectively, have to limit future carbon-dioxide emissions to roughly three hundred and fifty billion tons. Since global emissions are now running at about forty billion tons a year, this gives the world less than a decade until, as Thunberg observed, âthat budget is gone.â\n\nThe first global conclave on climate change was held in Geneva, in 1979, when Thunbergâs mother, Malena Ernman, was eight years old. (A few years ago, Thunberg persuaded Ernman, an internationally renowned opera singer, to give up flying, which meant that she also gave up her international career.) The first treaty on the problemâthe U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Changeâwent into effect in 1994, nearly a decade before Thunberg was born. It soon became clear that the treaty was ineffective, and so it was amended, with the Kyoto Protocol, which entered into force in 2005, when Thunberg was a toddler.\n\nThe Paris Agreement, itâs now evident, is also woefully inadequate. A potluck supper of a pact, it asks each country to contribute its own emissions-reduction target. According to Climate Action Tracker, an independent research group, only two nationsâMorocco and Gambiaâhave set targets consistent with holding the worldâs fever to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Five others have set targets consistent with two degrees. All the rest have targets that are âinsufficient,â âhighly insufficient,â or âcritically insufficient.â Into this last category falls the United States. With less than five per cent of the worldâs population, this nation is responsible for more than twenty-five per cent of cumulative emissions. On an annual basis, itâs the worldâs second-largest emitter, after China.\n\nTo accommodate the U.S.âs unfortunate politics on the issue, the Paris Agreement was not officially designated a treaty. This allowed the [Obama Administration](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/obama-administration) to bypass Congress when it drew up its admittedly âinsufficientâ targets. The Trump Administration, of course, has said that it will withdraw from the agreement, and has been systematically reversing whatever progress had been made. Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was loosening the rules on methane leaks from oil and gas operations. (As a greenhouse gas, methane is many times more potent than COâ.) Last week, the Administration moved to revoke Californiaâs authority to set its own tailpipe-pollution standardsâan authority that the state was granted by Congress in 1967.\n\nAre the politics of climate change in America changing? There are positive signs. Earlier this month, the top ten candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination participated in a CNN [town hall](https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/the-growing-impatience-for-action-at-cnns-climate-change-town-halls) on the issue; according to the _Times_, this was âthe first such prime-time eventâ in history. A recent Washington _Post_ poll found that more than three-quarters of Americans now consider climate change a âcrisisâ or a âmajor problem.â A survey conducted this summer of voters in Texas showed that, even in the oil patch, a majority are concerned about climate change. Thunbergâs actions have inspired hundreds of thousands of young people around the globe to stage school strikes for climate action. Ahead of the strike called for the eve of the climate summit, the New York City school system said it would excuse students who skipped classes; Thunberg was set to speak to the strikers in Foley Square.\n\nStill, youâd have to ignore most of the past forty years to conclude that action is imminent. The same _Post_ poll that showed rising concern about warming indicated continuing resistance to doing much about it. Fewer than half of those surveyed said that theyâd support a two-dollar-a-month surcharge on their electricity bills, and only a third would support a ten-cent-per-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax.\n\nMuch has been written in the past few weeks about the importance of remaining hopeful. Without hope, the argument goes, thereâs no hope. In any event, giving up isnât an option. Blow past 1.5 or two degrees Celsius and thereâs the prospect of 2.5, or three or four or even more, to worry about. New climate models unveiled the other day in France suggest that, if emissions continue unabated, by 2100 global temperatures could rise by a beyond-apocalyptic seven degrees. At no point will it cease to matter how much carbon goes into the air and how much stays in the ground.\n\nOnce again, Greta Thunberg has put it best. âPeople sometimes ask me if Iâm an optimist or a pessimist,â she said in a recent interview. âI am a realist.â As for hope, that âis something you need to deserveâthat you have actually done something.âÂ â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d664a08312cd3aa6d1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Greta Thunberg","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"greta-thunberg"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a397f5b30646d05ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmentalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmentalism"},{"id":"5c2e1da041c92e2c9b85db5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Activists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"activists"}],"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03351c7a8e33fb390bec","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Elizabeth Kolbert has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1999.

But it seems to me, in our rapidly darkening world, that the converse of Kafkaâs quip is equally true: *There is no hope, except for us*.  \n \nIâm talking, of course, about climate change. The struggle to rein in global carbon emissions and keep the planet from melting down has the feel of Kafkaâs fiction. The goal has been clear for thirty years, and despite earnest efforts weâve made essentially no progress toward reaching it. Today, the scientific evidence verges on irrefutable. If youâre younger than sixty, you have a good chance of witnessing the radical [destabilization of life on earth](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/20/climate-change-and-the-new-age-of-extinction)âmassive crop failures, apocalyptic fires, imploding economies, epic flooding, hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing regions made uninhabitable by extreme heat or permanent drought. If youâre under thirty, youâre all but guaranteed to witness it.  \n\nIf you care about the planet, and about the people and animals who live on it, there are two ways to think about this. You can keep on hoping that catastrophe is preventable, and feel ever more frustrated or enraged by the worldâs inaction. Or you can accept that disaster is coming, and begin to rethink what it means to have hope.  \n\nEven at this late date, expressions of unrealistic hope continue to abound. Hardly a day seems to pass without my reading that itâs time to âroll up our sleevesâ and âsave the planetâ; that the problem of climate change can be âsolvedâ if we summon the collective will. Although this message was probably still true in 1988, when the science became fully clear, weâve emitted as much atmospheric carbon in the past thirty years as we did in the previous two centuries of industrialization. The facts have changed, but somehow the message stays the same.  \n\nPsychologically, this denial makes sense. Despite the outrageous fact that Iâll soon be dead forever, I live in the present, not the future. Given a choice between an alarming abstraction (death) and the reassuring evidence of my senses (breakfast\\!), my mind prefers to focus on the latter. The planet, too, is still marvelously intact, still basically normalâseasons changing, another election year coming, new comedies on Netflixâand its impending collapse is even harder to wrap my mind around than death. Other kinds of apocalypse, whether religious or thermonuclear or asteroidal, at least have the binary neatness of dying: one moment the world is there, the next moment itâs gone forever. Climate apocalypse, by contrast, is messy. It will take the form of increasingly severe crises compounding chaotically until civilization begins to fray. Things will get very bad, but maybe not too soon, and maybe not for everyone. Maybe not for me.  \n\nSome of the denial, however, is more willful. The evil of the Republican Partyâs position on climate science is well known, but denial is entrenched in progressive politics, too, or at least in its rhetoric. The [Green New Deal](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/green-new-deal), the blueprint for some of the most substantial proposals put forth on the issue, is still framed as our last chance to avert catastrophe and save the planet, by way of gargantuan renewable-energy projects. Many of the groups that support those proposals deploy the language of âstoppingâ climate change, or imply that thereâs still time to prevent it. Unlike the political right, the left prides itself on listening to climate scientists, who do indeed allow that catastrophe is theoretically avertable. But not everyone seems to be listening carefully. The stress falls on the word *theoretically*.  \n\nOur atmosphere and oceans can absorb only so much heat before climate change, intensified by various feedback loops, spins completely out of control. The consensus among scientists and policy-makers is that weâll pass this point of no return if the global mean temperature rises by more than two degrees Celsius (maybe a little more, but also maybe a little less). The I.P.C.C.âthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâtells us that, to limit the rise to less than two degrees, we not only need to reverse the trend of the past three decades. We need to approach zero net emissions, globally, in the *next* three decades.   \n\nThis is, to say the least, a tall order. It also assumes that you trust the I.P.C.C.âs calculations. New research, described last month in *[Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/scientists-have-been-underestimating-the-pace-of-climate-change/)*, demonstrates that climate scientists, far from exaggerating the threat of climate change, have underestimated its pace and severity. To project the rise in the global mean temperature, scientists rely on complicated atmospheric modelling. They take a host of variables and run them through supercomputers to generate, say, ten thousand different simulations for the coming century, in order to make a âbestâ prediction of the rise in temperature. When a scientist predicts a rise of two degrees Celsius, sheâs merely naming a number about which sheâs very confident: the rise will be *at least* two degrees. The rise might, in fact, be far higher.  \n\nAs a non-scientist, I do my own kind of modelling. I run various future scenarios through my brain, apply the constraints of human psychology and political reality, take note of the relentless rise in global energy consumption (thus far, the carbon savings provided by renewable energy have been more than offset by consumer demand), and count the scenarios in which collective action averts catastrophe. The scenarios, which I draw from the prescriptions of policy-makers and activists, share certain necessary conditions.  \n\nThe first condition is that every one of the worldâs major polluting countries institute draconian conservation measures, shut down much of its energy and transportation infrastructure, and completely retool its economy. According to a recent paper in *[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1364-3)*, the carbon emissions from existing global infrastructure, if operated through its normal lifetime, will exceed our entire emissions âallowanceââthe further gigatons of carbon that can be released without crossing the threshold of catastrophe. (This estimate does not include the thousands of new energy and transportation projects already planned or under construction.) To stay within that allowance, a top-down intervention needs to happen not only *in* every country but *throughout* every country. Making New York City a green utopia will not avail if Texans keep pumping oil and driving pickup trucks.  \n\nThe actions taken by these countries must also be the right ones. Vast sums of government money must be spent without wasting it and without lining the wrong pockets. Here itâs useful to recall the Kafkaesque joke of the European Unionâs biofuel mandate, which served to accelerate the deforestation of Indonesia for palm-oil plantations, and the American subsidy of ethanol fuel, which turned out to benefit no one but corn farmers.  \n\nFinally, overwhelming numbers of human beings, including millions of government-hating Americans, need to accept high taxes and severe curtailment of their familiar life styles without revolting. They must accept the reality of climate change and have faith in the extreme measures taken to combat it. They canât dismiss news they dislike as fake. They have to set aside nationalism and class and racial resentments. They have to make sacrifices for distant threatened nations and distant future generations. They have to be permanently terrified by hotter summers and more frequent natural disasters, rather than just getting used to them. Every day, instead of thinking about breakfast, they have to think about death.  \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nCall me a pessimist or call me a humanist, but I donât see human nature fundamentally changing anytime soon. I can run ten thousand scenarios through my model, and in not one of them do I see the two-degree target being met.  \n\nTo judge from recent opinion polls, which show that a majority of Americans (many of them Republican) are pessimistic about the planetâs future, and from the success of a book like David Wallace-Wellsâs harrowing â[The Uninhabitable Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703/),â which was released this year, Iâm not alone in having reached this conclusion. But there continues to be a reluctance to broadcast it. Some climate activists argue that if we publicly admit that the problem canât be solved, it will discourage people from taking any ameliorative action at all. This seems to me not only a patronizing calculation but an ineffectual one, given how little progress we have to show for it to date. The activists who make it remind me of the religious leaders who fear that, without the promise of eternal salvation, people wonât bother to behave well. In my experience, nonbelievers are no less loving of their neighbors than believers. And so I wonder what might happen if, instead of denying reality, we told ourselves the truth.\n\nFirst of all, even if we can no longer hope to be saved from two degrees of warming, thereâs still a strong practical and ethical case for reducing carbon emissions. In the long run, it probably makes no difference how badly we overshoot two degrees; once the point of no return is passed, the world will become self-transforming. In the shorter term, however, half measures are better than no measures. Halfway cutting our emissions would make the immediate effects of warming somewhat less severe, and it would somewhat postpone the point of no return. The most terrifying thing about climate change is the speed at which itâs advancing, the almost monthly shattering of temperature records. If collective action resulted in just one fewer devastating hurricane,  just a few extra years of relative stability, it would be a goal worth pursuing.  \n\nIn fact, it would be worth pursuing even if it had no effect at all. To fail to conserve a finite resource when conservation measures are available, to needlessly add carbon to the atmosphere when we know very well what carbon is doing to it, is simply wrong. Although the actions of one individual have zero effect on the climate, this doesnât mean that theyâre meaningless. Each of us has an ethical choice to make. During the Protestant Reformation, when âend timesâ was merely an idea, not the horribly concrete thing it is today, a key doctrinal question was whether you should perform good works because it will get you into Heaven, or whether you should perform them simply because theyâre goodâbecause, while Heaven is a question mark, you know that *this* world would be better if everyone performed them. I can respect the planet, and care about the people with whom I share it, without believing that it will save me.  \n\nMore than that, a false hope of salvation can be actively harmful. If you persist in believing that catastrophe can be averted, you commit yourself to tackling a problem so immense that it needs to be everyoneâs overriding priority forever. One result, weirdly, is a kind of complacency: by voting for green candidates, riding a bicycle to work, avoiding air travel, you might feel that youâve done everything you can for the only thing worth doing. Whereas, if you accept the reality that the planet will soon overheat to the point of threatening civilization, thereâs a whole lot more you should be doing.  \n\nOur resources arenât infinite. Even if we invest much of them in a longest-shot gamble, reducing carbon emissions in the hope that it will save us, itâs unwise to invest all of them. Every billion dollars spent on high-speed trains, which may or may not be suitable for North America, is a billion not banked for disaster preparedness, reparations to inundated countries, or future humanitarian relief. Every renewable-energy mega-project that destroys a living ecosystemâthe âgreenâ energy development now occurring in [Kenyaâs national parks](https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-kenyas-push-for-development-is-threatening-its-prized-wild-lands), the giant hydroelectric projects in Brazil, the construction of solar farms in open spaces, rather than in settled areasâerodes the resilience of a natural world already fighting for its life. Soil and water depletion, overuse of pesticides, the devastation of world fisheriesâcollective will is needed for these problems, too, and, unlike the problem of carbon, theyâre within our power to solve. As a bonus, many low-tech conservation actions (restoring forests, preserving grasslands, eating less meat) can reduce our carbon footprint as effectively as massive industrial changes.  \n\nAll-out war on climate change made sense only as long as it was winnable. Once you accept that weâve lost it, other kinds of action take on greater meaning. Preparing for fires and floods and refugees is a directly pertinent example. But the impending catastrophe heightens the urgency of almost any world-improving action. In times of increasing chaos, people seek protection in tribalism and armed force, rather than in the rule of law, and our best defense against this kind of dystopia is to maintain functioning democracies, functioning legal systems, functioning communities. In this respect, any movement toward a more just and civil society can now be considered a meaningful climate action. Securing fair elections is a climate action. Combatting extreme wealth inequality is a climate action. Shutting down the hate machines on social media is a climate action. Instituting humane immigration policy, advocating for racial and gender equality, promoting respect for laws and their enforcement, supporting a free and independent press, ridding the country of assault weaponsâthese are all meaningful climate actions. To survive rising temperatures, every system, whether of the natural world or of the human world, will need to be as strong and healthy as we can make it.  \n\nAnd then thereâs the matter of hope. If your hope for the future depends on a wildly optimistic scenario, what will you do ten years from now, when the scenario becomes unworkable even in theory? Give up on the planet entirely? To borrow from the advice of financial planners, I might suggest a more balanced portfolio of hopes, some of them longer-term, most of them shorter. Itâs fine to struggle against the constraints of human nature, hoping to mitigate the worst of whatâs to come, but itâs just as important to fight smaller, more local battles that you have some realistic hope of winning. Keep doing the right thing for the planet, yes, but also keep trying to save what you love *specifically*âa community, an institution, a wild place, a species thatâs in troubleâand take heart in your small successes. Any good thing you do now is arguably a hedge against the hotter future, but the really meaningful thing is that itâs good today. As long as you have something to love, you have something to hope for.  \n\nIn Santa Cruz, where I live, thereâs an organization called the [Homeless Garden Project](http://www.homelessgardenproject.org/). On a small working farm at the west end of town, it offers employment, training, support, and a sense of community to members of the cityâs homeless population. It canât âsolveâ the problem of homelessness, but itâs been changing lives, one at a time, for nearly thirty years. Supporting itself in part by selling organic produce, it contributes more broadly to a revolution in how we think about people in need, the land we depend on, and the natural world around us. In the summer, as a member of its C.S.A. program, I enjoy its kale and strawberries, and in the fall, because the soil is alive and uncontaminated, small migratory birds find sustenance in its furrows.  \n\nThere may come a time, sooner than any of us likes to think, when the systems of industrial agriculture and global trade break down and homeless people outnumber people with homes. At that point, traditional local farming and strong communities will no longer just be liberal buzzwords. Kindness to neighbors and respect for the landânurturing healthy soil, wisely managing water, caring for pollinatorsâwill be essential in a crisis and in whatever society survives it. A project like the Homeless Garden offers me the hope that the future, while undoubtedly worse than the present, might also, in some ways, be better. Most of all, though, it gives me hope for today.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d3322d4972cd5b83326","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environment"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Psychology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"psychology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef00ebe912338a37171f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cultural Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"cultural-comment"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a7ebda97f12ef9160a83","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Franzen is a frequent contributor of essays, stories, and reported pieces to *The New Yorker*.

(In March, Manafort was found guilty of failing to pay taxes on payments that he had received for his work as a consultant in Ukraine.) Now it seemed like Trump was [raising the stakes further](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/did-trump-try-to-extort-the-president-of-ukraine-into-investigating-joe-biden), asking the countryâs President to open an investigation into unproven allegations against Biden and thereby lend credence to them.\t\n\nThat is an unwelcome, and potentially dangerous, scenario for any Ukrainian President, given the degree to which Ukraine relies on American diplomatic, economic, and military assistance. It is not just the hundreds of millions of dollars in annual aid that Kiev depends on but also American loan guarantees, economic sanctions against Russia, and diplomatic involvement in negotiating an end to the war in the Donbass. With that conflict continuing to boil, American military training and weaponry remains vital to Ukraineâs military. In 2018, the Trump Administration agreed to supply the country with anti-tank Javelin missiles. \n\nEnding up as the open antagonist of an American President is not really an option for a Ukrainian leader. [Since he took office](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/can-the-actor-who-ruled-ukraine-on-tv-do-it-in-real-life), in May, Zelensky has made relations with the Trump Administration a priority. A forty-one-year-old comedian who played Ukraineâs President on television before entering politics, Zelensky and his advisers hoped to organize a personal meeting as soon as possible, and thought a bilateral summit in Washington might happen by the end of the summer. The fact that no such meeting materialized was the first sign that things were off to an uneasy start with Trump. The second came last month, when Trump personally held up two hundred and fifty million dollars in American aid for Ukraine and released it only under the threat of an embarrassing vote in the Senate that would have forced him to do so. \n\nA decisive sticking point appears to be Trumpâs political interest in resurfacing old allegations connected to the [business dealings of Hunter Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), Joe Bidenâs son, in Ukraine. In April, 2014, Hunter accepted a lucrative seat on the board of Burisma, one of Ukraineâs largest natural-gas producers, a decision that Hunter said he made without consulting his father. (Biden and Hunter had an informal arrangement that predated Hunterâs work with Burisma and was designed to insulate Biden from questions about his sonâs private dealings: Biden wouldnât ask Hunter about his business activities, and Hunter wouldnât tell his father about them.)\n\nAt the time, Biden was the point person in the Obama Administration for Ukraine policy, and later, in 2016, he pressed the government of the President at the time, Petro Poroshenko, to dismiss its general prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who was seen as covering up for corrupt officials and failing to pursue high-profile graft investigations. (A 2016 [story for this magazine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/05/reforming-ukraine-after-maidan) about a pair of young Ukrainian lawmakers touched on the Shokin affair.)\n\nTo pressure Poroshenko into removing Shokin, the Obama Administration withheld a billion dollars in loan guarantees. (Ukrainians began calling Shokin âthe billion-dollar man.â) In 2016, a senior official in the Obama White House said in an interview that Biden spoke to Poroshenko by phone every few weeks and communicated to him that, as far as additional loan guarantees were concerned, âYou can meet every single other condition, but until you replace this guy you are not getting this money.â  \n\nYet there is no evidence that Bidenâs insistence had anything to do with his son or with BurismaâShokin was not pursuing a Burisma-related case at the time, and thus his firing didnât affect Hunter Bidenâs legal prospects in Ukraine one way or another. Instead, it was almost certainly a reflection of Shokinâs terrible reputation among Ukrainian reformers, anti-corruption activists, and Western partners, including officials at the E.U. and I.M.F. \n\nThat didnât stop Trumpâs personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani, from seizing on the would-be conspiracy story as a way of damaging Biden, who may emerge as Trumpâs opponent in [the 2020 Presidential contest](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/2020-election). The narrativeâthat Biden had Shokin fired in order to protect Hunterâgained traction in March on Fox News and other conservative media outlets. Giuliani, meanwhile, grew frustrated that the allegations werenât getting more attention from mainstream news organizations.\n\nAll this left the new Zelensky administration, in Kiev, in an awkward position. In June, Zelensky dispatched Andriy Yermak, a lawyer and a longtime friend, to Washington for meetings with Trump Administration officials. His main task was to prepare an official visit of Zelensky to Washington, which Ukrainian officials wanted to organize as soon as possible. He met with the national-security adviser at the time, John Bolton, and also visited members of Congress. \n\nIn an interview this week, Yermak denied that any Trump Administration officials raised the prospect of a quid pro quo in which Ukraine would pursue a corruption investigation that could damage Biden in exchange for American support: âOn such a political level, no one talks about these things in plain text.â Yermak said that his mission was to âchange our image and for us to be seen as a new team, to explain who is Zelensky and how he differs from his predecessors.â He added, âI think the whole problem is that we are some new people who came to power. They donât know us yet in Washingtonâthey are still figuring us out. Itâs a normal working process.â\n\nIn the course of the summer, though, Giuliani intensified his efforts to get the Zelensky administration to pursue the Burisma case, a development that could damage Biden. Yermak decided that it would be best to hear him out in person. âWhy should we rely on speculation and secondhand conversations?â he asked himself. âWhy donât I just talk with Giuliani directly? Iâm a fan of what he did for New York when he was mayor.â\n\nIn May, Giuliani was planning a trip to Kiev to push Ukrainian officials on Burisma and Biden, and also to argue that the publishing of the Manafort payments, in 2016, amounted to election interference. When Giuliani faced criticism for blending personal politics with official U.S. foreign policy, he cancelled his visit. Instead, Yermak and Giuliani met in Madrid. Yermak said that the question of Burisma was âraised among others, while we were discussing in general what next steps would be for President Zelenskyâs new team.â \n\nIn an interview on Saturday, Giuliani said that he was explicit with Yermak about what he saw as a need for the new Ukrainian government to fully investigate the Burisma matter, including allegations against Biden and his son, and Ukrainian collusion in 2016, among other matters. Giuliani said that Yermak left him with the âimpressionâ that the administration had agreed to relaunch the investigation. âHe [Yermak] said to me that President Zelensky was committed to making sure that all these things were done fully, completely, and lawfully, that right now they didnât have their own prosecutor,â Giuliani said. âAnd, as soon as they got a new prosecutor, that they would do a complete investigation. I said, âThatâs all we can ask. Weâre not asking for any resultsâwe are just asking that this thing finally be investigated.â&nbsp;â (A member of Yermakâs staff said that Yermakâs comments related to all investigations carried out by the Zelensky government, and did not refer to âany particular investigation.â) \n\nThe general position of the Zelensky administration seems to be to hear out the Trump White House and not reject any requests out of hand while also not leaping to fulfill them. Itâs a difficult balance: not saying no to Trump but also not quite saying yes. âThey canât not pick up the phone,â Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, who met with Zelensky in Kiev earlier this month, said. âYouâve got to play a long game here.â\n\nThat is, of course, easier said than done, especially if Trump did indeed linkâwhether explicitly or through hints and through proxies such as GiulianiâAmerican aid money to Zelenskyâs coÃ¶peration on matters of personal political interest to Trump. âThe wise policy is to be open,â Oleksandr Danylyuk, the secretary of Ukraineâs security and defense council, said. âOur U.S. partners have some concerns. They are open about thisâand thatâs not a bad thing. Itâs good.â As for pressure or arm-twisting from Washington, Danylyuk added, âWe shouldnât be in this position.â He emphasized, âWe have a strong partnership with the United Statesâand it should stay like that.â \n\nFor his part, Yermak said that if the Trump Administration is truly concerned about the Burisma case or other judicial questions in the country, it is welcome to raise them through formal channels. âIf tomorrow our American partners express a desire to understand what is happening in this or that case, it would be most logical to arrange a meeting between the Attorney General and our general prosecutor, where they could discuss all the issues regarding coÃ¶peration between the United States and Ukraine.â  \n\nItâs clear that Zelensky and his team would like to stay as far away from this story as possible: if thereâs a major scandal looming, itâs an American one, not a Ukrainian one, and standing too close to the blast wave when the scandal explodes will only hurt them. Zelensky came to office as a political outsider with the mandate to disrupt Ukraineâs entrenched political order, and getting caught up in an American political scandal would be distracting at best, disastrous at worst. He needs U.S. aid, not to mention diplomatic backing, if he is to have any chance of ending the war with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. Ending up at the center of a political fight, let alone U.S. congressional investigations, does little to advance those interests.\n\nThe whole story must be a dispiriting one for Ukraine. Zelensky, like previous Ukrainian Presidents, put great hopes on his personal relationship with his American counterpart, though it turned out that Trump was not so interested in Zelensky and his agenda; he was interested in his own agenda. If Trump did indeed try to link the promise of American aid to Ukraine to his own political goals, that would represent a remarkable about-face for the American-Ukrainian relationship. Across successive administrations in both countries, U.S. policy emphasized the importance of the rule of law and sought to minimize the politicization of the Ukrainian judicial system, which had, time and again, been used as an instrument of retribution or political expediency by Ukrainian Presidents. \n\nTrumpâs apparent request to Zelensky flipped that logic on its head: this time, it was a U.S. President looking to use the Ukrainian justice system for political ends, and, given Zelenskyâs apparent reluctance to do so, a Ukrainian President holding a U.S. President at bay and keeping that from happening. Trump tried to take another President hostage, but appears to have created more problems for himself.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Many details about this story remain murky, but the implication seems to be that the whistle-blower is alleging that Trump promised to release two hundred and fifty million dollars in stalled aid for Ukraine if Zelensky would launch a corruption investigation into matters involving [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden) and [his son, Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign). \n\nYou might think that sounds too outrageous to be plausible: a President who spent just under two years being investigated for possibly colluding with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election putting the squeeze on another foreign country to interfere in the 2020 race. But hang on a minute. Shortly after the *Postâs* story dropped, Trumpâs lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who has for months been claiming (without any real evidence) that Joe Biden bribed Ukrainian officials to drop a corruption investigation involving his son, went on Chris Cuomoâs CNN show and [said](https://www.mediamatters.org/rudy-giuliani/watch-rudy-giuliani-melt-down-cnn-after-being-asked-about-whistleblower-complaint), âIt is perfectly appropriate for a President to say to a leader of a foreign country, âInvestigate this bribe, that was paid by a former Vice-President, that our media in America is covering up.â&nbsp;â\n\nFor the past few days, reporters have been trying to get more details about the whistle-blowerâs complaint. Joseph Maguire, the acting director of National Intelligence, has ordered the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community not to pass it along to Congress, a decision that he says was based on legal advice from the Justice Department. The Administrationâs refusal to coÃ¶perate has caused a mighty row with the House Intelligence Committee, headed by Adam Schiff, Democrat of California. Of course, the Trump Administration and the Democrats on Capitol Hill are involved in many disputes arising from congressional investigations into Trump and his associates. But until now none of them have involved the suggestion that Trump may have exerted pressure on a foreign leader to take actions to help his 2020 reÃ«lection bid, and may have even pledged something in return.\n\nEven before this latest revelation, however, Trumpâs conversation with Zelensky, a former comedian and screenwriter who was elected President of Ukraine in April, had [attracted the attention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/democrats-investigate-whether-trump-giuliani-pressured-ukraine-to-aid-2020-reelection-bid/2019/09/09/fc3c39de-d31d-11e9-9610-fb56c5522e1c_story.html) of congressional Democrats, who were investigating what Trump and Giuliani were up to on the Kiev front. In August, [reports emerged](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531) that Trump was threatening to withhold two hundred and fifty million dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine, which was supposed to be used to deter Russian aggression in the east of the country.\n\nOn September 9th, the leaders of three Democrat-controlled House committees demanded the transcript and a list of participants on the July 25th call. The Democrats [said](https://www.salon.com/2019/09/09/house-democrats-to-investigate-rudy-giulianis-dealings-with-ukraine/) that Giuliani and Trump âappear to have acted outside legitimate law enforcement and diplomatic channels.â The Democrats also referred to a Ukrainian government readout from the July 25th call, which said that Trump told Zelensky he was âconvinced the new Ukrainian government will be able to quickly improve [the] image of Ukraine, [and] complete [the] investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA.â\n\nAt that stage, there was no suggestion of a link to a whistle-blower. But on Wednesday night the Washington *Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-communications-with-foreign-leader-are-part-of-whistleblower-complaint-that-spurred-standoff-between-spy-chief-and-congress-former-officials-say/2019/09/18/df651aa2-da60-11e9-bfb1-849887369476_story.html) that the whistle-blowerâs complaint âinvolves President Trumpâs communications with a foreign leader, according to two former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.â The report went on, âTrumpâs interaction with the foreign leader included a âpromiseâ that was regarded as so troubling that it prompted an official in the U.S. intelligence community to file a formal whistleblower complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community, said the former officials.â\n\nThis *Post* story led to a lot of speculation about the identity of the foreign leader. The whistle-blower filed the complaint on August 12th. During the previous few weeks, Trump had spoken with a number of foreign leaders in addition to Zelensky. They included Russiaâs Vladimir Putin, Pakistanâs Imran Khan, Hollandâs Mark Rutte, and the Emir of Kuwait. The fact that Putinâs name was on the list produced a lot of excitement online, but no new details. \n\nOn Wednesday morning Trump weighed in, writing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/117469652131036364), âAnother Fake News story out there - It never ends! Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader, I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies, not to mention those from the other country itself. No problem!â In a second [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/117469652191433932), he went on, writing, âKnowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially âheavily populatedâ call. I would only do what is right anyway, and only do good for the USA!\"\n\nThe tweets didnât solve the mystery of who the foreign leader was. But at about 8 *P.M.*{: .small} on Thursday evening, the *Post* appeared to clarify the matter, posting its story under the headline âWhistleblower complaint about Trump involves Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the matter.â The report didnât say explicitly that the complaint concerned the call between Trump and Zelensky, but it did note that the call took place just two and a half weeks before the whistle-blower made the filing.\n\nAs the rest of the media was trying to digest this news, Giuliani [appeared](https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/19/politics/rudy-giuliani-joe-biden-ukraine-cnntv/index.html) on CNN and, almost immediately, went off a cliff. In addition to claiming that it would be fine for Trump to pressure Zelensky and his government to investigate Biden, he admitted that heâd already done so himself, and also managed to contradict his story in the process. The first time that Cuomo questioned Giuliani about whether  he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, he replied, âNo, actually, I didnât.â But then he went on to say he had inquired how a certain Ukrainian official had ended the corruption investigation that allegedly involved Hunter Biden. âSo you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?â Cuomo asked. âOf course I did,â Giuliani replied.\n\nAlthough he defended Trumpâs right to pressure the Ukrainian President to investigate Biden, Giuliani also insisted that he didnât know anything about the conversation between Trump and Zelensky. Crazy as all of this undoubtedly was, the former New York mayorâs appearance was something of a sideshow. The crux of the matter is his client, and whether he attempted, effectively, to extort Zelensky into trying to find dirt on Biden. As they say in the news business, this story is still developing. The next step, surely, is for Congress to get access to the whistle-blowerâs complaint. Only then will we find out what it amounts to.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a36cecf40192141ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Intelligence","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"intelligence"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The complaint reportedly concerned Trumpâs interactions with a foreign leader, who was later identified as the Ukranian President, Volodymyr Zelensky. Under the [Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998](https://www.congress.gov/105/bills/hr3829/BILLS-105hr3829rh.pdf), intelligence officials can report an âurgent concernâ to the Office of the Inspector General, who is in turn required to transmit âcredibleâ concerns to the director of National Intelligence (D.N.I.). He or she, in turn, has seven days to âforward such transmittal to the intelligence committees, together with any comments the Director considers appropriate.â The goal is to insure that Congress learns of the complaint and can carry out appropriate oversight of the executive branch. In this case, the inspector general, Michael K. Atkinson, deemed the complaint worthy of investigation. But, after consulting with the Justice Department, Joseph Maguire, the acting D.N.I., did not release the substance of the complaint to Congress, refusing to deem the complaint an âurgent concernâ because it had to do with someone not under the âresponsibility and authorityâ of the D.N.I. This prompted outcries from Democrats, with the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Adam Schiff, saying, âthere is no privilege that covers whether the White House is involved in trying to stifle a whistle-blower complaint.â \n\nMeanwhile, the Presidentâs attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, admitted that he had pressured the Ukrainian government to open an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden and his family. And, on Friday, the *Wall Street Journal* [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-defends-conversation-with-ukraine-leader-11568993176) that Trump had personally asked Zelensky to do so âabout eight times,â encouraging him to work with Giuliani on the investigation. This immediately raised questions about whether Trump was trying to leverage the Presidency to gain information about a political opponent, and in the process sparked the whistle-blowing complaint. (Trump replied on Twitter, âStrange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation, that they would not have also come forward. Do you know the reason why they did not? Because there was nothing said wrong, it was pitch perfect!â)\n\nTo discuss the legal issues involved in the Administrationâs refusal to hand over the substance of the complaint to Congress, and possible wrongdoing by the President, I spoke by phone with Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and an expert on national-security law. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the remedies for Presidential misbehavior, the debates over executive power in the Trump era, and what the next Congress should do to prepare for a future President like Trump. \n\n__Is there any way that a President could break the law by making either a promise or a threat to a foreign leader?__ \n\nThis gets us back to the whole debate over whether Presidents are subject to criminal prosecution for anything. My own view is that the answer is yes, there are things the President can do that would be illegal. I am just not sure there are criminal as opposed to political consequences for it. \n\n__Letâs put aside the idea of impeachment versus prosecution. Given the broad executive powers we afford Presidents, rightly or wrongly, how could a President break the law?__ \n\nI do think it is possible for Presidents to engage in bribery. I do think it is possible for Presidents to engage in extortion. In a nightmare scenario, where the President agrees to bomb a particular part of a country in exchange for personal enrichment. I think there are multiple criminal statutes that would apply to that scenario, whether or not the President could be prosecuted. If someone asked the President to kill an American in exchange for something, that would run afoul of federal murder statutes. I donât think it is true that the difficulties in prosecuting a sitting President translate into a sitting President not being bound by ordinary criminal laws. \n\n__Letâs say, pulling two scenarios out of a hat, that the President is only going to follow through on giving aid to a country if the country either investigates his political opponent or pays him a bribe, by, say, spending a night at his resort in Scotland. How would you evaluate those two issues?__ \n\nI think the latter is a more straightforward legal problem because of anti-bribery statutes and because of a statute called the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act, which clearly applies to the President. The former is messier, but, to me, this is the big category error everyone is making, which is that, criminal or not, that is certainly impeachable. \n\nUntil this episode, I donât think that anyone has read the intelligence-community statute to be limited to unlawful conduct by the subject of the complaint, or that you have to identify a specific law that the subject of the whistle-blowerâs complaint has arguably violated. The question at the bottom of this whole episode is whether what the President allegedly did falls in the scope of something that would give rise to a valid whistle-blower complaint. I think there are a lot of folks who are arguing that the answer is no because the President is allowed to say whatever he wants in this context. I think the statute doesnât limit whistle-blowing in this context to identifying specific federal statutes that the subject of the complaint has transgressed.\n\n__Jack Goldsmith, the conservative legal scholar, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jacklgoldsmith/status/1174721100246323201), âI donât think there is a legal avenue to correct such a betrayal of national trust by the Chief Executive and Commander in Chief. That is one of the accommodations the Constitution makes for the benefits of a vigorous Presidency who can conduct foreign policy in secret.â What is your response to this argument?__ \n\n[Laughs.] I think that is a pathway to authoritarianism. Jack is jumping from no prosecution to no oversight, and I think that is a distinction that the law actually reflects. It may be that the President is not breaking the law when he does that. That doesnât mean that Congress or at least the intelligence committees donât have a right to know what he is doing.\n\n__Right, but as a purely legal matter, how do you view that idea of executive power?__ \n\nI think it is a pretty scary view of executive power. \n\n__Would one response be that it is unfortunate but true that the Constitution, or the way it is interpreted, give a pretty scary view of executive power?__ \n\nI think the short version is: yes. There are plausible ways to read the Constitution to give the President a scary amount of executive power. We have seen a lot of that, regardless of your politics, whether it is Democrats looking at Trump and [George W.] Bush or Republicans looking at Obama. Where I think Jack and I really diverge is on the constraints and the checks on that power. Jack thinks the principal check on that power is the ballot box. And I think the Constitution and the relevant statutes contemplate a meaningful role for Congress, not in prohibiting the President from doing all of these things but in holding him politically accountable when he does.\n\n__What is your reading of the intelligence communityâs refusal to turn over this information to Congress?__ \n\nI think it is just wrong. It would be one thing if the reason that they are refusing to turn this over to Congress is because they believe that turning the complaint over to Congress would violate some constitutional privilege. But the actual argument they have made, at least in the two letters they have made public, is a very counterintuitive reading of the statute.\n\nThe whole point of the statute is that, once a whistle-blower complaint meets a certain threshold, as determined by the inspector general, the intelligence committees get to find out about it. The reason is that Congress, when it writes whistle-blower statutes, is often worried about the subject of the whistle-blowing being the political head of the agency. If I wanted to blow the whistle on the director of National Intelligence, it wouldnât make a lot of sense to give the D.N.I. the power to refuse to transmit my report to Congress. And the statute is written that way. The statute says that, once the inspector general makes a credibility determination, the D.N.I. has seven days to forward it to the intelligence communities. Now, the D.N.I. is not bound by the inspector general. The statute allows him to provide his own comments on the report, so the D.N.I. can certainly object to the inspector generalâs finding. He just canât stop the inspector general from submitting it to Congress.\n\n__If the D.N.I. continues to refuse to submit this to Congress, are there any legal remedies for the congressional committees?__ \n\nThis is the problem. The intelligence-community statute also says that there is no judicial review to challenge actions by the director of National Intelligence or the inspector general. And so I think it will be an uphill battle for the House Intelligence Committee to go to court and argue that a court can order the acting director of National Intelligence to transmit the report to Congress.\n\n__What did you make of the D.N.I. going to the Department of Justice to seek legal counsel on submitting the report to Congress?__ \n\nI am not troubled by that, because the statute does contemplate that the acting D.N.I. is allowed to share his own views on the complaint. And so, if the acting D.N.I. went to D.O.J., the D.O.J. says these things, and the D.N.I. writes a letter to Congress in which he transmits the report and says, âI disagree for the following reasons, in consultation with D.O.J.â To me, this is the system actually working fine. The problem is not that Maguire went to D.O.J.; the problem is that when D.O.J. told him not to transmit the report, he listened. I think D.O.J. is misrepresenting his legal obligations under the statute.\n\n__If a sane person is elected President in 2020, and Congress wanted to address the fact that we have had a crazy situation with Trump, and wanted to address the fact that the system will grant the next President who will misuse his or her power tremendous room to operate, how would you start to think about what could be done to change the laws?__ \n\nThatâs obviously a huge question. I think there are two levels of response to the Trump phenomenon. One is to make much clearer the ability of courts to decide some of these inter-branch disputes. So, as opposed to all of these political impasses over subpoenas, or whistle-blower complaints, or emoluments, where there are questions about whether the court can play any role, the first thing Congress could do is to make it much clearer that Congress wants the courts to play a role in these contexts. So that whatever the merits of these disputes are, there is a greater likelihood that the merits will be reached and resolved.\n\nAnd the second thingâand this wouldnât really help us in this scenario or get us out of the sticky wicket in the whistle-blower contextâbut, more holistically, there are all kinds of contexts in which Congress has granted the President power that Congress can also only claw back with a veto-proof supermajority in both houses: The border wall, A.U.M.F. [the Authorization for Use of Military Force, from 2001], court vacancies. It seems to me that Congress ought to get more in the habit of imposing sunsets on authoritiesâwhere, whether we are worried about Obama or Trump, we think Presidents have gone far past what Congress ever could have intended. It seems like Congress can preserve a role for itself in these same contexts going forward, if it has more and more of these authorities sunset.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e992bfcc72cd92d071a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Whistle-Blowers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"whistle-blowers"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b397f5b30646d0607","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Corruption","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"corruption"}],"sections":[{"id":"5ca62e18086d2b15cd18f023","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Q. & A.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"q-and-a"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a5fcdd6207318b5db81f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Isaac Chotiner is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*, where he is the principal contributor to [Q.&nbsp;&&nbsp;A.](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a), a series of timely interviews with major public figures in politics, media, books, business, technology, and more.

 [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) had come to California earlier this week, and found smog conditions similar to those that prevailed here only a few decades ago, itâs easy to imagine what he would have done: tweeted about the âSad Dem Smog!â and promptly set up an e-commerce site selling *MAGA*{:.small}-branded catalytic converters and air filters.\n\n \n\nInstead, Trump, who on Tuesday held fund-raisers in Silicon Valley and Beverly Hills, enacted a different form of eco-trolling, when he promised on Wednesday to cite San Francisco for the environmental damage that its homeless population has caused. On a roll, the following day, he made good on a yearlong threat to deny California the right to continue setting its own, more stringent [tailpipe-emissions standards](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/18/761815991/white-house-to-revoke-waiver-allowing-california-to-set-its-own-emissions-standa), which the state has had since Nixon first granted it the authority, as part of the Clean Air Act, in 1970. In a [joint statement](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-administration-announces-one-national-program-rule-federal-preemption-state-fuel) by the E.P.A. and the Department of Transportation, the Trump Administration also withdrew permission for California to require carmakers to offer zero-emissions vehicles, a prerogative enshrined in Obamaâs 2013 Clean Air Act. Back then, the mandate was designed to stimulate innovation, for our collective salvation; in these dark ages of retrograde, reactionary American climate policy, it served only to provoke a gaslighting, gas-loving President whoâs determined to turn back time.\n\n \n\nOn Friday, California, as it has become accustomed to doing, sued the Administration in an effort to preserve the stateâs legacy rights surrounding emissions standards and clean vehicles. (Twenty-three other states and three cities joined the suit, which was filed in federal court in D.C.) âThe environment is Californiaâs foreign policy,â [Gavin Newsom](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/05/gavin-newsom-the-next-head-of-the-california-resistance), the governor of California, told me on Thursday, as the complaint was being finalized. âItâs where we assert ourselves on the international stage, not just the national stage.â This is the sixtieth lawsuit that California has filed against the Trump Administration and, according to Newsom, by far the most consequential. âWe have the law on our side, we have the facts on our side, we have science on our side, and we have moral authorityânot just the formal authorityâto fight back,â he told me.\n\nItâs a fight that California has to win. Cars, trucks, and buses are Americaâs [largest contributors to global warming](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions), and California has the largest auto market in the United States. The reason the state has been aggressive on tailpipe emissions is not because it is the home to countless Tesla-driving eco-snobs but because it is the place where the problem first presented itself most acutely. The toxic coincidence of sunshine, cars, and mountainous terrain meant that by the late nineteen-sixties Californiaâs air quality was [the worst in the United States](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/about/history). Now, of the countryâs ten most-polluted metropolitan areas, [seven are in California](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/24/air-pollution-smog-soot-worst-california/3551734002/).\n\n \n\nCaliforniaâs solutions are providing a template for similarly polluted and carbon-dependent economies to emulate. China has created zero-emissions-vehicle policies [based on Californiaâs mandate](https://qz.com/1286376/china-is-going-to-sell-half-the-worlds-electric-cars-by-borrowing-policies-from-california/); the Chinese government has said that, by 2025, it wants a fifth of all cars sold there to be electric. In July, California negotiated with four automakersâFord, Honda, BMW, and Volkswagen, which represent thirty per cent of U.S. new car salesâto establish a fifty-one-miles-per-gallon standard for all the cars they sell by 2026. Trump is seeking to cap that figure at thirty-seven miles per gallon in 2021. Earlier this month, his Department of Justice opened an antitrust investigation into the automakersâ California deal.\n\n \n\nNewsom said, âIf weâre at an inflection point in climate policy, then this issue of tailpipe emissionsâfrom an air-quality perspective, from a public-health perspective, and from a greenhouse-gas perspectiveâis the game-changer. Transportation is the biggest sector of consequence. We can lament Paris, we can lament the clean-power plan heâs overruling, we can lament other initiatives, like the one on pesticides, but this is *the* big issue. If weâre not successful, itâs about adding a massive amount of particulate matter, increasing smog, worsening our climate crisis, massively increasing fuel costs to consumers, killing jobs, and killing Americaâs competitiveness internationally by harming the auto industry.â\n\n \n\nNewsom says that the latest assault on Californiaâs climate leadership is borne of desperation, and depends on junk science and a shoddy legal argument. I asked him if it could challenge the extent of Californiaâs power to define a climate future in spite of Trump. âItâs a test on the limits of *his* power, absolutely,â Newsom said. âBecause of the power, scale, and scope of the state and its influence with clean cars, heâs met his match. Heâs discovering the limits of his power and authority.â\n\n \n\nTrumpâs adversarial stance is helping to shape Californiaâs twenty-first-century identity as the Resistance State. In its shadow, Trumpâs insecurities grow: the leader of the free world canât control his unruly golden child. âItâs Nancy Pelosiâs California, itâs Adam Schiffâs California,â Newsom said. âItâs a frustrating place for him to be, and a frustrating time for the President.â Newsom went on, âWeâre running historic surpluses, and heâs running historic deficits. Weâre outperforming him as a nation-state in G.D.P. growth, and heâs despised here. Weâre the most un-Trump state in America. He suffers the incredulity of not winning the popular vote. He lost it because of California disproportionately. Heâs been rejected by Hollywood in the past. Heâs a man scorned.â","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Miller is the developer of [Snapcrap](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapcrap/id1436238261), a camera-based smartphone app that allows users to document human and animal waste on the street and report it with an automatically generated messageââI see poopââto the cityâs 311 program. For years, visitors to San Francisco have been shocked by the jewel-box cityâs intensifying filth; according to the *Guardian*, [complaints about feces](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/18/san-francisco-poop-problem-inequality-homelessness) have gone up four hundred per cent in the past decade. To remedy the problem, Mayor London Breed, who campaigned on cleanliness and who sometimes makes unannounced appearances on especially squalid blocks carrying a broom, instituted a new public-works unit called the [Poop Patrol](https://abc7news.com/society/san-franciscos-new-poop-patrol-will-try-to-find-waste-before-you-do/3956216/). Still, the city has only twenty-five public toilets serving an unhoused population of some seventy-five hundred people. An infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, [has compared](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/San-Francisco-dirty-needles-feces-foreign-slums-12627779.php) certain parts of San Franciscoâwhere contaminants include a proliferation of discarded needlesâto slums heâs studied in the developing world. The slums were cleaner.\n\nMiller is pale and unprepossessing. Behind us stood the hacker house where, two years ago, as a recent graduate of the University of Vermont, he found a room to rent. âI get dropped off literally right here, and, at first glance, itâs a Friday afternoon, I was, like, O.K., good enough,â he told me. âWithin a week of living here, it became very apparent that itâs not the most desirable neighborhood to live in.â For months, commuting to his job at a software company that facilitates in-app messagingâfor when, say, a rideshare driver needs to contact a fareâhe avoided piles of excrement. A few of his housemates stepped in them (and threw out their shoes). Many of the housemates were working on startups, and one eventually developed Ample, a successful food-replacement drink. One night, at a gathering that they called Beers and Ideas, talk turned to complaints about the street, and a friend suggested that they make an app for reporting waste. âI definitely donât consider myself a social-justice champion or warrior or whatever,â Miller said. âBut it was, like, This is insane; weâre all sort of pissed off. We thought, Thisâll be funny, and make it easier for people to submit tickets, and bring it some attention.â\n\nOnce Miller came up with the name Snapcrap, the concept followed easily. The logoâwhich Snapchatâs lawyers took offense at, and which has since been changedâfeatured a caution-tape-yellow backdrop with a stylized white poop emoji. Understandably, the app has no feed. âI thought about doing that initially,â Miller said, âbut then I thought, Does anyone really want to go through and look at that?â In South of Market, Miller took me on a brief tour of the block, which generated only a handful of potential reportsâa clean day. The human story, however, was bleak: older, ailing people missing teeth and limbs; a motionless body removed by paramedics from the corner single-room-occupancy hotel. Miller knows the identity of each user, which, he says, discourages cruel and degrading misuse of the app, such as photographing suffering people or encampments. I asked him for a theory of the fecal Zeitgeist. âItâs the dichotomy between the Ã¼ber-wealthy people in the tech industry living, you know, next to people who essentially have nothing,â he said. âWhich is, like, pretty insane, when you think about it.â\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nShit-talking, any reader of Twitter knows, is [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)âs strategy of choice. And the deeper in the shit he sinksâpolitically, legally, logically, grammaticallyâthe more he flings. In January, when the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, or, as Trump calls her, âNancy,â refused to submit to his call for the southern-border wall as a way to end the longest government shutdown in history, conditions on the ground in San Francisco were on his mind. After castigating her for behaving âirrationally,â he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1086980606955794433), âShe is so petrified of the âleftiesâ in her party that she has lost control&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!â Clearly, Pelosi isnât responsible for municipal sanitation in the city that elected her. But that was not Trumpâs point. He was attempting to humiliate her; in his version of events, she had âlost control,â and the mess in her city was proof.\n\nPoop is Trumpâs Other (in close competition with menstrual blood, which he figures as a pollutant that flows from âwhereverâ). Last year, in a failed discussion of immigration policy, he invented the noxious, racially anxious category of â[shithole countries](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-compounds-his-shithole-countries-bigotry-with-lies),â which, attending lawmakers told reporters, he defined as places like Haiti, El Salvador, and a number of African nations. The catch-all term included capitals that happen to lack [central sewage systems](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/07/29/537945957/you-probably-dont-want-to-know-about-haitis-sewage-problems), but it was evident that [the reference was to more than plumbing](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/shithole-countries/580054/). His fecal aversionâwhich, [if you follow French psychoanalytic theory](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2018/01/16/trump-disappears/), may also explain his love of giltâwas neatly expressed in a 2003 interview with Howard Stern. In it, the future President brings up the bathroom habits of his future wife, Melania, claiming that, as far as he knows, she does not defecate. âIâve never seen it; itâs amazing,â he says, grinningâin you know what fashion. âMaybe they save that for *after* marriage.â\n\nPolitical liberalism is a strange place to lay blame for problemsâlike unaffordable housing and the lack of a social safety netâthat stem from raw capitalism. Housing scarcity exerts pressure on even those participating in the narrowly distributed bounty of the tech economy. Miller told me that, even with his decent-paying work as an engineer, he lives with a roommate, and that he has heard of engineers at companies like Google who are living in R.V.s. As the tremendous wealth generated by the regionâs tech companies continues to growâso much that the industry feels ready to erect [a monument to itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/technology/silicon-valley-monument-landmark.html)âthe crisis on the streets of San Francisco is especially troubling. This is the progressive city where our ultra-modern, post-biological future is being invented. Why, then, does it look so much like our idea of the past?\n\nFor help answering this, I called Guy Geltner, an urban historian at the University of Amsterdam who studies the late Middle Ages. (His book âRoads to Health: Infrastructure and Urban Well-Being in Later Medieval Italyâ comes out in July.) Geltner, who recently lived in San Francisco for a year, told me that, for residents of a modern city in a supposedly sanitized society, the threat of human feces is symbolic. âWe look at poop, and it embodies something greater than a disease,â he said. âItâs something about the human body and human body politic that weâre afraid of watching as we commute to work. Public defecation is associated with mental illness. Itâs a loss of control. Who in their right mind, with the most minimal resources, would choose to squat between two parked cars. Who? To us, itâs this painful illustration of something gone unimaginably wrong. Thatâs more powerful than the actual biological dangers that these smelly piles pose.â\n\nGeltner makes the point that anything we donât like in ourselves we consign to the pre-industrial past, so that the word âmedievalâ is a term of derision, and the phrase âthe Dark Agesââactually the period when universities and urbanization were inventedâspeaks for itself. But, epidemiologically, the largest medieval city in Western Europe âParis, which had a population of two hundred thousand people before the Black Deathâwas biologically far safer than contemporary San Francisco or Los Angeles (or any large airport or hospital). Early civilizations had elaborate methods for waste disposal: the vast bureaucracy of Edo (medieval Tokyo) codified collection and composting; medieval Islamic regulations addressed how to move waste through the streets without spillage. The advent of plumbing is what led to the putrefaction of the canals of Venice, as the waste that accumulated in septic systems had nowhere else to go. âModernity is far messier than what came before,â he said. \n\nUnmanageable filth, it turns out, is a feature of modernity, though dirt undermines our notion of progress. âThe conditions in San Francisco and Los Angeles are uniquely early-twenty-first-century American, and even specific to the West Coast,â Geltner saidâas is the idea that you can solve them with an app. The technology holds the problem exactly at armâs length, solving and absolving, while doing nothing to address the underlying inequality. More than that, it expresses how inequality is perpetuated. Several months ago, Miller quit his job; the attention Snapcrap generated, he said, was helping him land loads of interviews. And he had found a new apartment, in a cleaner part of the city. (He did mention that he had recently heard from someone at [Lava Mae](https://lavamae.org), a not-for-profit organization that converts former transport buses into mobile toilet and shower units; he is open to sharing data about blocks and times where reports are most concentrated, to help the organization determine where and when to deploy its buses.) Still, a more radical tech would give unhoused people a way to register *their* complaints about and possible solutions to street life. In literature, the blind beggar is often a seer. In Californiaâs most futuristic city, the homelessâdistinctly vulnerable to crises and system-wide breakdownâare reading on the nationâs palm that something is going unimaginably wrong.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c98e56e652c9027468f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"San Francisco","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c2e20a441e4c73c088d7a9d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Housing Prices","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"housing-prices"},{"id":"5c2e1e05e56e652c9027481f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Salaries","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"salaries"}],"sections":[{"id":"5c4233af085b9c33f9cf348a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"California Chronicles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"california-chronicles"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a187ac14b3c606c109f8a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Dana Goodyear, a staff writer, was on the editorial staff of *The New Yorker* from 1999 to 2007, when she began writing full time for the magazine.

The slow clap. The grin, the slow clap, and the brisk hand rub. Gavin Newsom, Californiaâs leading candidate for governor, paced a crowded Teamsters hall in Fresno, manifesting his delight at being among real people for a real talk at last. The pageantry also gave him time to read the crowdâhundreds of expectant faces, citizens of a Central Valley checkered by alfalfa fields and raisin-processing facilities and half-abandoned downtownsâand suss out what they wanted to hear. Town halls are Newsomâs favorite way to campaign; this one, in early June, was his thirty-fifth of the electoral season. A former baseball standout once recruited by the Texas Rangers, he views town halls as spring training for the rigors of governing.\n\nIt was four days before the âjungle primary,â a multiparty free-for-all that would advance two gubernatorial candidates from a field of twenty-seven to the general election, in November. Newsom, the stateâs lieutenant governor, was far ahead in the polls, and, if his position held, he would come into office with a budget surplus of nearly nine billion dollars. But, like many Democratic politicians in the Donald Trump era, he was trying to harness not only the alarm of moderates and the rage of progressives but the almost universal yearning for a new politics entirely. He sought a platform that would exemplify the sloganââCourage for a Changeââblazoned across his campaign bus: a platform that was risky and inspiring, yet at the same time sensible and inclusive and grounded in the lunch-pail realities of daily life. But what platform, exactly? And would anyone really believe he could make it happen?\n\nHis visuals are certainly unassailable. Tall and lithe and still boyish at fifty-one, with teeth that Tom Cruise would envy and hair lacquered with Oribe gel, Newsomâwho as the mayor of San Francisco was known as Mayor McHottieâis easy on the eyes. His wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker and a former actress who for a time dated George Clooney, was alarmed by the hunger that Newsom can evoke. She said, âI canât tell you how many women and gay men would tell me, when I started dating him, âI want him!âÂ â In Fresno, he sported his trademark look: a white Ermenegildo Zegna shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a blue Tom Ford tie. It was also his hero Bobby Kennedyâs lookâthe Bobby Kennedy who visited Cesar Chavez in the Central Valley fifty years ago, when America was breaking apart over Vietnam. Newsom seeks to embody Kennedyâs grainy glamour, to provide moral clarity in a bewildering hour.\n\nIf R.F.K. came across as a bare-knuckle fighter converted to humility, Newsom presents an image that an adviser describes as âpretty boy with a slide rule.â The back of his state-issued S.U.V. is stacked with notebooks filled with ideas and data culled from books and articles and conversations with nearly four hundred experts; itâs a kind of rolling athenaeum. Severely dyslexic as a child, he learned to learn by copying key passages in his left-handed scrawl and reading them aloud. He gradually compresses each of the topics he follows into a one-sheet of facts that salt his talks: _Fourteen per cent of low-income familiesâ after-tax income goes to diapers! Eighty-five per cent of brain growth happens in the first three years!_ His campaign manager, Addisu Demissie, who has also helped to run campaigns for Cory Booker and Hillary Clinton, told me, âGavin is by far the most knowledgeable candidate Iâve ever worked with.â Newsom lacks the God-given gifts of, say, Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles mayor who dazzled voters as a break-dancing Rhodes Scholar. But, he told me, âI will outwork you. I will read more, I will think more, I will reflect more. I just will.â\n\nAlthough Newsom is prepared to answer any question, he sometimes has trouble answering _your_ question. When asked to name the biggest issue facing Fresno, Newsom spoke rapidly, in his hoarsely resonant baritone. âAffordability,â he said. âI mean, itâs _the_ issueâcost of living, housing, itâs the No. 1 issue, issues of childcare for your family, issues of education, cost of education, _access_.â The way he punches certain words gives his speech the inexhaustible quality of a sea chantey. âAnd the perennial issueâI was just down in Bakersfieldâthe issue of air quality, issue of health, and the unique health _disparities_ that exist out there, the issues of primary-care physicians, access to quality care, affordability of quality health care, all those issues have to be tackled. And, with all due respect, while our economy is growingâ4.2-per-cent unemployment rate, twenty-four consecutive months of job creationâpeople donât live in the aggregate, not everybodyâs _feeling_ that recovery, and weâve got to deal with the issue of income and wealth disparity.â There was more, until he concluded, âAnd so I feel very, very passionately about those issues.â\n\nLike the state he hopes to govern, Newsom evokes an endless wave rather than a fixed locale. Eric Garcetti said, âGavin is future-facing, like California. Heâs almost from central casting. Like a tech entrepreneur, heâll test ideas and fail forwardâheâll adapt to whatever happens.â Newsomâs approach to policy is self-avowedly entrepreneurial and bold. A longtime California political observer said, âThereâs always a narrative of great moral challenge that Gavin Newsom single-handedly rises to while all around him cower.â\n\nNewsom reminded the crowd in the Teamsters hall of the âproof pointsâ of his audacity: his leadership in legalizing cannabis use in the state; his introduction of universal access to health care in San Francisco; and, particularly, his decision, in 2004, to ignore the law and permit the cityâs same-sex couples to marry. He skipped over the wayward, muddled period of his mayoralty when he drank too much and had an affair with his appointments secretary.\n\nFrom the start of his first term as an executive, Newsom apprehensively called himself âthe future ex-mayor of San Francisco.â He says that it was a reminder not to fall in love with the role, because âpeople donât give a damn. They forget you.â Actually, heâs almost too memorable. Despite all his policy-paper annotating, Newsom, who built a fortune on a consortium of hospitality businesses, has the air of a man who just sauntered off a yacht. He married Jennifer Siebel, in 2008, at an âOut of Africaâ-themed wedding, attended by San Francisco and Silicon Valleyâs Ã©lite, including Sergey Brin, George Shultz, Charles Schwab, and Gordon and Ann Gettyâwho a decade earlier had thrown Newsomâs âGreat Gatsbyâ-themed thirtieth-birthday party. Voters still have trouble believing that a man so palpably blessed could feel their pain.\n\nAfter forty minutes in Fresno, Newsom knew that he hadnât yet made the crowd believe it. When Elizabeth Howard, an eight-year-old African-American with pink and white ribbons in her hair, said she was worried that there would be a shooting at her school, Newsom reminded the audience that, in 2017, he took on the National Rifle Association and got voters to pass Prop. 63, which implements a background check on everyone who buys ammunition. Then he turned back to Elizabeth and knelt before her. At such moments, his voice slows and gravels up. âWhen you go to school, the last thing you should be thinking about is guns,â he said. âI promise you youâll be safe in school and able to learn.â The applause, long pending, broke at last.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the civil war against Donald Trump, Newsom casts himself as Abe Lincoln. He says that Californiaâs gubernatorial election will anoint âthe next head of the resistance.â Much of Newsomâs Twitter feed, which has 1.4 million followers, is devoted to calling out the President, disputing him on issues and labelling him âa small, scared bullyâ and âa pathetic disgrace.â On the stump, Newsom points out that the ânation-stateâ of California is larger than a hundred and thirty-seven countries and has the fifth-largest economy on the planet. âThe world is looking to _us_ for leadership,â he often says.\n\nCalifornia seems like a natural home for the resistance. The day after Trump was elected, the leaders of the State Senate and the State Assembly jointly declared, âCalifornia was not a part of this nation when its history began, but we are clearly now the keeper of its future.â The state has sued the Trump Administration forty-four times, on matters ranging from *DACA*{: .small} to health care to the census. As the White House abandons environmental protections, California is suing to maintain its historic right to set its own air-quality standards, and it passed a law mandating that all its electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045\\. It also resisted the new federal income-tax laws, established its own form of net neutrality, and declared itself a sanctuary state.\n\nYet the state that gave birth to the counterculture, in 1967, gave us the Reagan revolution the same year. Across the decades, California has led the nationâs judder to the right with three populist ballot initiatives: Prop. 13, which capped property taxes; Prop. 184, a widely imitated three-strikes law; and Prop. 187, which denied state services to undocumented immigrants. Whatâs more, by electing Arnold Schwarzenegger governor, in 2003, the state normalized the idea of installing a bombastic and untried entertainer in office. And, while California boasts Hollywood and Silicon Valley, it also has the nationâs highest poverty rate and nearly half the countryâs homeless population.\n\nSo there are plenty of reasons for the stateâs nationally ambitious politicians to look after local concerns. Governor Jerry Brown, who has served four terms in the job since 1975 and is widely admired for his recent work to refill the stateâs empty coffers, told me, âDo people really believe that âall your problems are Trumpâ? Itâs too abstractâitâs not road repair, tuition, health care, crime. It can rub people the wrong way.â\n\nâI disagree,â Newsom said. âYou gotta go after a bully.â In September, when Trump joked about moving to California because it has free health care (it doesnât, but Newsom hopes to institute a single-payer program), Newsom tweeted back, âNext time you call me and my policies out, have the guts to @ me and we can have a chat.â He takes Trumpâs jabs at California personally, because he takes nearly everything personally. SCN Strategies, a leading political-consulting firm in San Francisco, used to train its candidates how not to deal with the media by showing them Newsomâs tantrums when challenged by television reporters: the petulant silences and huffy diatribes. (âOff the record, Iâm amazingly disappointed, amazingly!â) SCN doesnât show that footage around these days, because itâs now advising Newsom himself on what not to do.\n\nWhen Newsom canât defuse a challenge, he sometimes gets sulky. This spring, a group of billionaires who favor charter schools began funding a *PAC*{: .small} supporting Newsomâs chief Democratic rival, the former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The *PAC*{: .small} raised and spent more than twenty-two million dollars; Michael Bloomberg and Eli Broad, former Newsom allies, donated five million between them. Newsom immediately wrote off both men: âThey clearly do not want to have a relationship anymore.â He was a little less brusque with Reed Hastings, the Netflix C.E.O., whoâd given seven million. Hastings told me he explained to Newsom that âit wasnât an anti-Gavin thingâit was just that I had a great relationship with Antonio.â Newsom said, âWe had this strange conversation where I told Reed, âI thought you guys would only put in ten millionââI really thought fiveâand he said, âIâm only putting in half of what I otherwise would, because itâs _you_.âÂ â Newsom snorted. âWith all due respect to Antonio, itâs demonstrated they canât win by building him up, so they have to tear me down. If they can knock me down three or four points and come in second, then theyâre validated. And then they could put in a hundred million dollars in the general, easyâ_easy!_ â He told me, somewhat implausibly, that he hadnât seen the attack ads the *PAC*{: .small} was airing: âIs it the arrogant-jerk, slicked-hair thing? Yeah, I get it.â He grimaced at the unfairness. Newsomâthe clear leader in the race, a multimillionaire who had already raised thirty-two million dollarsâwas casting himself as an upstart being steamrolled by the moneyed Ã©lite.\n\nâPrivately,â he continued, âIâve developed a _real_ animus against private wealth. Wow, just because you made a lot of money, you can buy anything you want, including a candidate? If itâs me and Antonio in the general, there could be a real evolution in me, where I come out a very different person expressing outrage against a system stacked against him. Itâs a new muscle Iâm developing. You may be talking to Bernie Sanders in six months.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAfter a day of meetings, Newsom returned, with evident pleasure, to his house high on a hill in Kentfield, north of San Francisco. Itâs modern, tasteful, and secluded. On our way, heâd joked, preÃ«mptively, about how I was likely to draw a lazy inference from the Tesla in his driveway. Actually, there were three.\n\nIn his home office, Newsom pointed to his clutter-free desk and said, âI eat here and work here and watch MSNBC here. And I always check Tucker Carlson on Fox, to see how far heâs going on the racism spectrum.â Histories of Bobby Kennedy and his era filled the bookshelves, and three R.F.K. photographs adorned the walls. In one, from 1968, Kennedy was stumping with Newsomâs father, Bill, who was running for the State Senate. Kennedy was assassinated a week later, and Bill Newsom lost that fall. âI get that you shouldnât run on nostalgia, that the branding should be âRepresent tomorrow,âÂ â Newsom said. âBut Iâm too in love with the optimism of those years. This picture of Bobby Kennedy crouching to talk to a kid in the Central Valleyâthis hardheaded guy nobody particularly loved, whose journey made him a different man? Thatâs _everything_.â\n\nJohn Avalos, a former member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, supports Newsomâs campaign but is troubled by his rhetorical use of Kennedy. âIt wasnât R.F.K. who made 1968 so great,â Avalos said. âIt was the huge peopleâs movement around the world that brought R.F.K. forward and gave him energy. Gavinâs vision is âWhat Iâm going to doânot _with_ people but _for_ them.âÂ â Newsom doesnât relish the rote functions of politics. His smile when he poses with voters is a rictus, he ducks fund-raising calls, and he lacks patience for the backroom hugger-mugger required to pass legislation. Tom Ammiano, a board member who initiated a health-care plan that Newsom later made his own, said, âThere were members of the board who woke up every morning wanting to fuck Gavin Newsom over.â\n\nMuttering about the housekeeper, Newsom angled two chairs together. His cousin Jeremy Scherer had told me, âGavinâs such a fanatic about detail that I donât think Iâve ever seen a lit candle at his house. Once you light a candle, it looks used.â Newsom realigned an arrowhead on a shelf, then grinned sheepishly. âIâve got some issues,â he said.\n\nWe moved into the living room, where his wife embraced him. Siebel Newsomâwarm, telegenic, and fluent in Spanishâis a potent asset on the campaign trail. Her belief in him at least equals his own, and she is quicker to discuss the possibility of a President Newsom.\n\nShe lowered her voice and told Newsom that Hunter, their seven-year-old, âhad his first bad experience with older boys today. They put poop on his head.â\n\nâWell, welcome to life, buddy.â\n\nTheir four children tumbled into the room, and then their white Labrador, Max, raced in noisily from the kitchen. Newsom stood and commanded, âNo barking, bud!â Max, still barking, bounded into my lap, and the children hooted and ran to pet him. Siebel Newsom, murmuring to her children in Spanish and to Max in alpha tones, restored order.\n\nNewsom turned to his nine-year-old daughter, Montana, and said, âTadâs going to ask you, âDo you like Daddyâs hair with hair gel or no hair gel?âÂ â\n\nâNo hair gel,â she said. Newsom spread his arms and threw his head backâ_a guy canât win_.\n\nAfter the children ran off, I brought up a perplexing issue: for someone as personable as Newsom is, he doesnât seem to have many intimates. His habit of prefacing disclosures with âLiterally,â âCandidly,â or âSwear to Godâ suggests a man accustomed to striving for familiarity. I wrote about Newsom for this magazine in 2004, and noticed a certain insularity then, too; his wife at the time, Kimberly Guilfoyle, told me, âIf San Francisco were a woman, he would have married her.â (In what is perhaps a form of long-simmering revenge, she is now dating Donald Trump, Jr.) Katherine Munson, a childhood friend of Newsomâs, recently told me, âGavin is always around pretty people. But he doesnât seem to have many real friends.â\n\nNewsom turned to his wife: âWe have a lot of great friends, right? We have a good circle?â She nodded reassuringly. âTotal strangers, walking the street with them, Iâm very comfortable,â he continued, half to himself. Siebel Newsom glanced at me. Sheâd told me that Newsomâs childhood, when he was bullied and felt conspicuousâhe had a lisp, a bowl haircut, and braces on his legs from a growth spurtâmade him mistrust being sought out now. âGoing from that to being treated like a god made him very uncomfortable,â she said.\n\nWhen Newsom was two, his parents separated, and he and his younger sister lived with their mother, Tessa, who worked three jobs and took in foster children to help pay the rent. Bill Newsomâwho had gone to high school with Gordon Getty and who administered the Getty trustsâoccasionally swooped in to take Gavin on vacation with the Getty family: polar-bear watching in Hudson Bay, safaris in Africa. When he returned from these jaunts, his mother would say, âHope you had _fun!_Â â and storm off to bed. âThe _guilt_,â he told me. âShe made me feel horrible.â\n\nOne night, Newsom recalled hearing âmy mother yelling and screaming at my dad because he wasnât able to help us financially, because he was very close to bankruptcy. He didnât care about money, but I _never_ wanted to be in that position.â Jeremy Scherer said, âGavinâs motherâs struggles motivated him to be more successful in politics than his father wasâand to _show_ him he could be more successful.â\n\nIn middle school, Newsom, drawing inspiration from âRocky,â took up boxing and drank raw eggs to toughen himself. Then he began applying hair gel and wearing blazers and business suits, a costume inspired by âRemington Steele,â the TV show that starred Pierce Brosnan as a con man who assumes the identity of a glamorous private detective. âThe suit was literally a mask,â he said. âI am still that anxious kid with the bowl-cut hair, the dyslexic kidâthe rest is a faÃ§ade. The only thing that saved me was sports.â In high school, as a baseball and basketball star, Newsom began to see himself as an underdog with a responsibility for other underdogs. His friend and teammate Derek Smith told me, âGavin was the guy who stood up and made sure no harm came to us.â\n\nIn 1992, after graduating from Santa Clara University, Newsom went into business with Gordon Gettyâs son Billy, opening PlumpJack Wine & Spirits in San Francisco. Then Newsom launched the Balboa CafÃ©, which became a gathering place for the cityâs young heirs, scions of families like the Fishers and the Pritzkers, who in turn became his early political patrons. Gordon Getty, a minority investor in those businesses, invested more heavily as Newsom kept expanding, and owned forty-nine per cent of the PlumpJack Group by the time Newsom ran for mayor in 2003\\. Getty also underwrote the mortgage for Newsomâs first home; as he once told me, he thought of Newsom as a son. Newsom acknowledges that the help was invaluable but insists that it was his own farsightedness and hard work that made PlumpJack grow. After becoming mayor, he turned control of the business over to his sister, Hilary, and to Jeremy Scherer. It now comprises eighteen restaurants, wineries, hotels, and the like, and Newsomâs share of its profits is some $1.5 million a year.\n\nNewsom prefers to emphasize his childhoodâs Cinderella struggles, because the rescue-by-fairy-godmother aspect gets used against him. One gubernatorial rival called him a âDavos Democratâ; anotherâs *PAC*{: .small} labelled him âFortunate $on.â âItâs not exactly that Gavin is jealous that he doesnât have a swam-over-the-Rio-Grande background,â one of his advisers said, âbut he does want an underdog story.â Siebel Newsom, who argues that âthe perception of Prince Gavin is all wrong,â asked SCN Strategies to focus its ad campaign on the hardscrabble years. But those spots tested poorly, as SCN had predicted they would, and the campaign ended up being about Newsomâs courage.\n\nAs the Newsoms ate cheese and crackers, he teasingly brought up her plan for the ads, and she got indignant: âI said, âPeople have to know who he really is.â And Sean Cleggââa partner at SCNââsaid, âPeople donât _care_ who he really is.âÂ â She looked to her husband for support.\n\nâThatâs the problem,â he said. âSean knows what heâs doing.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn the bus after events, Newsom appraises his performance at length, sometimes aloud. An undone shirt button made him look like a âjerk,â heâd garbled his point about rent control, or, often, heâd been too diffuse: âMy biggest threat to being a successful governor is my profound incapacity to distill what I want to accomplish into one or two issues.â\n\nHe kept feeling that he was failing to connect on the biggest topic: job automation. One study has estimated that by 2030 the ârobocalypseâ will erase eight hundred million jobs. Newsom, gesturing at his staff, told me, âThese guys said, âEnough with the future-of-work riffs, with _the robots are coming_.â I was spending too much time with the Elons of the worldââElon Muskââand I was just scaring people. If youâre going to identify a problem, at least express optimism about finding a solution. When I get into the remedy of doing transformation maps in each industry, and layering over a skills map, when I talk about nanodegrees and upscaling, well, _Iâve lost every single person_. Trump trounced on this issue, completely lying and telling them the old manufacturing economy was coming back: âIâm going to protect your job and itâs O.K.âÂ â\n\nMaybe the answer lay in the tapes. As a young man, Newsom made VHS tapes of three subjects and studied them obsessively: the smooth lefty swing of the Giantsâ first baseman Will Clark; episodes of âRemington Steeleâ; and every speech by Bill Clinton. When Newsom was mayor, his staff always knew when heâd been studying Clinton, because heâd speak with an Arkansas twang. He still employs Clinton mannerisms on the stump: the bit lip of empathy, the genial head toggle as he adjudicates, the drill-sergeant jaw pop before he wades in. Yet one official who knows both men suggested that their affects differ: âBill Clinton peers deeply into your soul. Gavin peers deeply into the mirror at himself.â\n\nNewsom told me he wanted to personalize the robocalypse the way Clinton personalized the economy in a town-hall-style debate in the 1992 campaign. Newsom, a gifted mimic, slid into a husky Clinton voice as he recited the exchange: after George H. W. Bush seemed baffled by a question about how economic anxieties had personally affected him, Clinton approached Bushâs interlocutor and asked her name. âIâll tell you how itâs affected me,â he said. âIn my state, when people lose their jobs, thereâs a good chance Iâll know âem by their names. When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it.â Newsom shook his head admiringly: âÂ âI know everybody in my state, _I know their names_ââI mean, come on, thatâs impossible! But that moment was, like, Whoa, what just happened? I fell in love with politics then.â\n\nJerry Brown told me that Newsomâs persona, âlively and attractive and on the move,â appealed to votersâ periodic wish for political renewal. A mandarin figure, Brown prides himself on mentoring no one. Nonetheless, Newsom spent months trying to gain his endorsement before the primary. Newsom has known Brown his whole life: his grandfather was a campaign manager for Brownâs father, Pat, a two-term California governor, and Brown appointed Bill Newsom to the state Court of Appeals. For the past eight years, Newsomâs office has been twenty yards from Brownâs. Yet Brown wouldnât engage. âMost politicians are mostly interested in themselves,â he told me. âThink of racehorses running around the track. One may look back to see if the others are gaining, but itâs a fairly individualistic pursuit.â He kept telling Newsom that he didnât need the endorsement, that he was going to win anyway. Or maybe he wouldnât, in which case, why should he give it?\n\nNewsom finally said, âI donât want your endorsement politically, I want it personally.â\n\nâItâs all politics, Gavin,â Brown replied, coolly.\n\nâNot for me!â Newsom declared.\n\nAfterward, Newsom told me, âI am laudatory everywhere I go, and thatâs what Jerry expects, and he is not laudatory everywhere he goes, and thatâs what I expect.â He laughed. âAnd that is actually a pretty good relationship with Jerry Brown.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nNewsom strode through throngs of homeless people camped on Ellis Street in San Franciscoâs Tenderloin district, calling out, âHow you doing, brother?â and âNice to see you, Maâam.â He stopped periodically to listen to Odyssean histories, offer tips on navigating the system, and turn down a repeatedly proffered beerââI try not to do it in the middle of the day, to control myself, brother.â\n\nAs mayor, Newsom often toured the Tenderloin unannounced to see what was really happening. Heâd been elected in 2003 owing to the popularity of a ballot measure called âCare Not Cash,â which heâd sponsored the previous year. The resulting program greatly reduced direct payments to the homeless and used the money to provide them with housing and services. Brown, who was then the mayor of Oakland, told me that he studied the program to see if it was worth emulating. âIt was _something_,â he allowed, âbut, as with so many things in government, you have these slogans, and then what really happens? We still have a lot of homelessness in San Francisco, right?â\n\nAlthough the city secured housing for twelve thousand people during Newsomâs administration, its streets are far denser with tents and shopping carts than they were in 2003\\. As Newsom smiled and thumbs-upped, he muttered, âThereâs no statewide policy, no timeline, no goals, no strategyâno one gives a damn! You wonder if you had any impact.â\n\nOutside the Quick-Stop Liquor Store, a young African-American man holding an orange hairbrush approached Newsom: âWhat you going to do for us?â\n\nâWhat do you need?â\n\nâMore houses for us, not white-people houses.â The man, who gave his name as Quan, said he lived in the Alice Griffith housing project.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5bd355a70d18cd75bce9bf54]||||||\n+++\n\nâDouble Rock!â Newsom cried, using the projectâs nickname. âYou going to college?â\n\nâWhy should I?â\n\nNewsom laughed. âYou want me to _literally_ answer that damn question? I can tell by your physiology you already know the answer.â His voice was stern, the tough-love headmaster. As Quan angled away, laughing, Newsom pursued him, saying, âCommunity college! Forty-six bucks a unit! And we can waive thatââ\n\nâWhat if I got a felony?â Quan cried, raising his arms as if in surrender.\n\nâAll right, we gotta work on that!â Newsom called. âIf itâs drug-related, we can waive that, too, after Prop. 47!â But Quan was gone.\n\nNewsom squinted at the surroundings and said, âAll this in the shadow of the Salesforce Towerââthe cityâs tallest building, whose anchor tenant is Salesforce, the cloud-computing company run by his friend Marc Benioff. Over the years, as Newsom has grappled with the intractability of poverty and racism, he has become more progressive on such issues as cash bail, sentencing reform, and Californiaâs status as a sanctuary state. As governor, he plans to appoint a homelessness tsar, to preÃ«mpt the problem of homeless people congregating in cities with more servicesâcities such as San Francisco. But heâs not sure that will work, either.\n\nAs we walked by a soup kitchen called St. Anthonyâs Dining Room, I mentioned that his former campaign manager Jim Ross had told me that, one winter night in 2002, Newsom drove to a discount clothing shop, bought a couple of thousand dollarsâ worth of socks and underwear, and delivered it to St. Anthonyâs. Newsom nodded ruefully. âSometimes,â he said, âyou get so frustrated you just have to do something directly.â\n\nNewsomâs mayoralty was defined by a similarly impulsive decision on gay marriage. Three weeks into the job, he heard President George W. Bush propose a constitutional amendment to preserve âthe sanctity of marriageâ and thought, _Heâs attacking my citizens!_ Two weeks later, he directed the city clerk to approve same-sex marriages. Newsomâs family, his staff, and every Democratic official heâd consulted advised him not to do it. Nancy Pelosi, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, said, âI told Gavin, âWe all share this valueâbut is this the right timing?â He said, âThis is about the _people_ and what matters to them.âÂ â\n\nThe result was a widely publicized âWinter of Love,â in which four thousand and thirty-six same-sex couples got married. That summer, though, a court nullified the marriages, and Newsom found himself isolated. When Barack Obama came to San Francisco, he made sure that he wasnât photographed with Newsom. In November, after George Bush defeated John Kerry, Senator Dianne Feinstein blamed Newsomâs initiative, saying, âThat whole issue has been too much, too fast, too soon.â\n\nIn 2008, Californiaâs Supreme Court struck down the law banning gay marriage, and an elated Newsom announced, âThis door is wide open now! Itâs going to happen whether you like it or not!â Ads for Prop. 8, a ballot measure to amend the state constitution to prohibit gay marriage, used that video clip to devastating effect. Newsom knew that heâd spiked the ball on the five-yard line: âA politician saying âWhether you like it or notââthat doesnât feel like democracy.â After Prop. 8 passed, _Newsweek_ wrote, âNewsom has become a joke to Democratic insiders, a man whose bright national future ended before it began.â\n\nOnly in 2013, when the Supreme Court upheld the equality of same-sex marriage, was he vindicated. Newsom told me that he remained proud of his original act of civil disobedience. But, he added, âso many of my political heroes read me the riot act. And, look, for a lot of years there was a lot of evidence that they were right.â He sighed. âI donât know if Iâd have the guts to do it again. Because back then I didnât know what I didnât knowâI had a beginnerâs mind.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn primary night, Newsom, his wife, and twelve members of his team huddled in a low-ceilinged room upstairs at Verso, a San Francisco night club owned by PlumpJack, while his supporters drank downstairs. Newsomâs strategy had been to single out his opponent John Cox, a Republican businessman whom Donald Trump had endorsed in a tweet. Newsom ran ads attacking Coxâwhich were actually intended to improve Coxâs standing among conservatives, so that heâd come in second, ahead of Antonio Villaraigosa. Other Democrats in the race called Newsom selfish; two Democrats atop the ballot would increase Democratic turnout in the fall and lift the Partyâs candidates in tight congressional races. But he was desperate to avoid going head to head with Villaraigosa and his charter-school *PAC*{: .small} of billionaires.\n\nAs the polls closed, Newsom sat with his fingers steepled. âWhat are the new numbers?â he asked.\n\nDaniel Lopez, his political director, peered at his computer. âWhich county?â\n\nâ_Over all_,â Newsom said. Silence. âIâm going to start drinking!â\n\nLopez looked up at last: âItâs all still coming inâbut weâre winning L.A. County.â Los Angeles is Villaraigosaâs home turf. âThirty-two for us, twenty-one for Cox, eighteen for Antonio.â\n\nâJesus Christ!â Newsom said, relieved.\n\nâIt was the ads,â Sean Clegg suggested, dryly. Siebel Newsom made a face: touchÃ©. Minutes later, CNN called the raceâNewsom and Cox would advance. Villaraigosa, who finished a distant third, later told me that Newsomâs cutthroat strategy was the smart play: âI told Gavin, âIâd have done the same thing.âÂ â\n\nNewsom showed his phone to a staffer and said, âClassic!â Texts were already streaming in from people wanting to host fund-raisers. When Reed Hastings texted congratulations (âYou are a star! If youâll still have me, Iâd be honored to support youâ), Newsom responded with an olive branch (âHonored!!â). Hastings promptly donated the maximum, twenty-nine thousand five hundred dollars.\n\nThough the champagne was flowing, there was an air of anticlimax. What now? Newsom trudged downstairs and delivered a stock address about the glories of California, âa state where we donât obstruct justice, we demand justice for everybody; where we donât regulate womenâs bodies more than we regulate assault weapons out on our streets.â Conspicuously missing, on the night when Newsom effectively became the next governor, was a clear signal of what exactly he hoped to do. âWe havenât been able to attach a narrative around the campaign,â he told me. âI feel Iâve let people down on that. Itâs all these _pieces_âweâre just reacting.â\n\nTwo months later, he said that he was still searching. âEverybody threw back at me, âWe do have a narrative! Itâs âCourage for a Change.âÂ â Courage is the brand, itâs what Iâve soldânot _sold_, exactly,â he clarified. âBut I feel we need something more.â Why not embrace your shift to the left, the way Bobby Kennedy did? Especially as progressives have captured the Partyâs energy? He nodded and said, âI started out in the middle and Iâve movedÂ .Â .Â . â He caught himself. âI donât know if more to the left. The more educated I become, the more I become a social-justice warrior about systemic racism. But Iâm still a passionate free-enterprise Democrat. And Iâm like Jerryâyouâve got to balance budgets, too.â He pointed, putting the world on notice: âThatâs going to disappoint a _lot_ of people.â From the rubble of an admission that he lacked a narrative, Newsom rescued the one narrative that had always consoled him: courage.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWhen his wife wandered to the back of the campaign bus, Newsom informed her that heâd just been telling me how theyâve begun to meditate.\n\nâThe way weâre going to calm our nation and soothe all our aggression is this,â Siebel Newsom said. âLeading with love and positivity.â He made a face. âItâs Californiaâyou can get away with it!â she said.\n\nâI donât think you can,â he said. âThatâs why this whole thing has been under wraps.â He was kidding, sort of. Newsom was inspired to try meditation by observing its effect on achievers such as Kobe Bryant and Marc Benioff, who teaches the practice. Benioff told me, âAfter Gavin went through his crisis, I think he was looking for a lot of things to shift in himself. What you see today is Gavin 2.0.â\n\nThe crisis was Newsomâs acknowledgment, in February, 2007, that two years earlier heâd had an affair with his appointments secretary, Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his deputy chief of staff and good friend Alex Tourk. In a sombre public statement, Newsom said, âThe affair is something I have to live with, and something that I am deeply sorry for.â He later announced that he would seek counselling for alcohol abuse. The period after his marriage broke up had got messy. He brought a nineteen-year-old girlfriend to an event where she was seen drinking wine; he showed up tipsy one night for a hospital visit to a mortally wounded police officer; and, when Rippey-Tourk went on sick leave to address her own alcohol abuse, the city, in an apparent exception to its procedures, paid her more than ten thousand dollars under a catastrophic-illness program.\n\nIn the #MeToo era, voters might have judged Newsom more harshly. But he was reÃ«lected that fall with seventy-four per cent of the vote. Still, Newsom told me that heâd been âhumbled in a profound way, humiliated and embarrassed.â He went on to say that he wouldnât be on the verge of becoming governor if he hadnât made those mistakes: âThereâs more to me now. Iâm more empathetic, I have a sense of gratitude, and I donât judge like I used to judgeâincluding the guy in the White House.â But, even as he cast his tribulations as a part of the heroâs arc, he avoided detailing why they had happened. When I pushed, he obscured himself in a cloud of bullet points: âPersonal journey, renewal, turning the page.â\n\nHis counsellor was Mimi Silbert, who runs a rehab center called the Delancey Street Foundation. They met daily at first, and then more sporadically across four years. The first thing Silbert did was to tell him to stop drinking. (Two years later, having decided he wasnât an alcoholic, she gave him permission to drink socially.) âI have two speeds, on and off,â Newsom told me heâd explained. âI said to Mimi, âWhen I have a drink, thatâs my moment when I turn off. Itâs _my_ time.â And she said, âYouâre still the fucking mayor!â I had never thought of that.â\n\nSilbert told me, âI would be trying to get at the feelings, but emotions were not Gavinâs strong suit. He gets excited by ideas, by having achieved thirty-seven per cent of his goals. And in that period there was no policy pathway out. He was just sad and lonely and he drank too much.â\n\nHaltingly, Newsom began to tell Silbert about the residue of his childhood. His mother had tried to read with him, but it didnât go well. Newsomâs daughter Montana is dyslexic and, he said, âI tell Jen, âDonât make me read with her!â Because when sheâs struggling with the words my daughter is me and Iâm my mother, and itâs too hard.â His mother grew so concerned by his torment over homework that she told him, âItâs O.K. to be average.â Bristling at the memory, Newsom told me, âI said, âNo! Thatâs not going to work for me!â That may have been the most damaging thing she ever said to me. It gave me all my drive. I hate her for itâbut I love her for it.â\n\nHe overcorrected. Newsomâs sister, Hilary, said that when their mother had breast cancer, in her fifties, he was difficult to reach. âGavin had trouble explaining to me how hard for him it was to be with her when she was dying, and I had trouble explaining to him how much I needed him,â she said. âBack then, he seemed like the kind of guy who would never change a diaper.â\n\nIn May, 2002, his mother decided to end her life through assisted suicide. Newsom recalled, âShe left me a message, because I was too busy: âHope youâre well. Next Wednesday will be the last day for me. Hope you can make it.â I saved the cassette with the message on it, thatâs how sick I am.â He crossed his arms and jammed his hands into his armpits. âI have P.T.S.D., and this is bringing it all back,â he said. âThe night before we gave her the drugs, I cooked her dinner, hard-boiled eggs, and she told me, âGet out of politics.â She was worried about the stress on me.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nSeven years later, Newsom made his first run for governor. The plan was to preÃ«mpt Jerry Brown, then the stateâs attorney general. But Brown announced a few months later, and Newsom knew he was finished. Still, he said, âI didnât have the guts to get out for another six weeks. I was playacting. _Undeserving_ was the pointâJerry was the better candidate.â\n\nAfraid that if he got out of politics heâd never get back in, he ran for lieutenant governor, a job heâd disparaged as âa largely ceremonial post.â He spent a year and a half trying to establish his authority, as the chair of a state commission for economic development, but Brown refused to appoint enough members for the commission to meet. âHe was very dismissive of me in the first term,â Newsom said. âHe literally didnât say a word to me.â Brown took issue with this characterization, telling me, âI spoke to him as much as I spoke to Mervyn Dymallyââthe long-forgotten lieutenant governor in Brownâs first term, in the seventies, a man so tainted by stories of corruption that he was voted out.\n\nNewsom avoided the capitol, in Sacramento, instead taking a desk at a work space for startups in San Francisco. He wrote a book called âCitizenville,â a techno-utopian vision of how to transform government. And, in his second term, he promoted ballot measures legalizing marijuana and instituting background checks on purchasers of ammunition. After Brown had enforced sufficient deference, he unbent a bit. Siebel Newsom said, âGavin would come back and say, âJerry showed me around the governorâs mansion!â So there have been scraps thrown.â\n\nThe political consultant Ace Smith, who has worked on most of Newsomâs campaigns, said, âGavinâs disastrous 2009 campaign for governor, and then having to suck up his pride and go for lieutenant governorâgetting knocked on his assâmade him a lot more humble.â His happy second marriage and growing family also aided in a quiet transformation. Still, the hair gel. âI see that person, too, the tall, slick guy with the suits,â Newsom suddenly announced one afternoon, as his S.U.V. roared down the highway. âThe image is self-inflicted. I didnât set out to create it, and when I worked at the wine store I wore ripped jeans and had my hat backward, but when I became a sommelier at the cafÃ© I put the suits back on and played that part: âWonderful to see you again, Mr. Smith. We have a delightful Chardonnay tonight.â And then politics reinforced it.â\n\nHe longs to merge his personas: âThereâs a blended version, where Iâm _on_ but Iâm not putting on the mask. I am so tempted to do an event with a hat and jeans and a T-shirt. But at the last minute I have vivid images of politicians who put on cowboy boots and Wranglers, still with a crease on them, to walk into the Dairy Queen. And when Obama wore the mom jeans to throw out that first pitch?â He was recalling the debacle of the 2009 All-Star Game. âI just canât forget that.â\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWith Villaraigosa out of the race, Newsom finally secured Jerry Brownâs endorsement, and by August he had a twenty-two-point lead over Cox. He decided to dedicate his September bus tour to supporting Democrats in six tight congressional races, hoping to help the Party win control of the House. Rather than attacking Cox any further, he would run ads that simply announced his plans. He polled prospective voters about seven issues, trying to determine whether they saw the stateâs problems through a lens of poverty or of education. Poverty won, but Newsom nonetheless authorized ads about education. âEducation _is_ economic opportunity _is_ access to jobs _and_ affordability!â he told me. âAll the dots connect! And weâll extend that to a college narrativeâweâre going to add a second free year of community college. So the frame is really the California Dream, how itâs in peril with infrastructure and homelessness. Itâs a positive frame, itâs not the anti-Trump frame, which would be our lazy campaignâthough we can go there if we have to.â (As the election neared, they did.)\n\nIn September, he sent me a long text after a breakfast with the Reverend James Lawson, a civil-rights leader who met with Bobby Kennedy. He wrote that Lawson âhit me hard saying what was missing was âa sense of urgencyâ a declaration to a âcauseâÂ .Â .Â . âpassionâ / âvision.âÂ â He made Newsom realize that âthis campaign is not about a campaign for governor, resplendent w dozens of policy ideas,â but is a crusade to address âpoverty, particularly childhood poverty.â\n\nLawson, he told me, had provided the narrative heâd been seeking. As Newsom put it in his subsequent ads, urging prenatal nurse visits and pre-kindergarten for all, âRenewing the California Dream? It starts with ending child poverty.â More important, Lawson had reminded him what it was all about: âHe asked meâit was almost spiritualâwhat my purpose in life was: â_Why are you here_?âÂ â The question hit Newsom so hard that he couldnât muster an answer.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLate one afternoon, Newsom went to San Franciscoâs City Hall to meet with the new mayor, London Breed. Breed, the first African-American woman to hold the post, was focussed on homelessness, and she, too, liked to gauge the cityâs efforts by walking the streets unannounced. The two officials were natural allies. Yet Newsom, sitting in the office where he had last made decisions of real consequence, appeared ill at ease. A television in the corner was live-streaming Breedâs former colleagues on the Board of Supervisors. âYou gotta be up here!â Newsom exclaimed, raising his arm. âYou canât get sucked into thatââhe dropped his arm to the floor.\n\nBreed replied, âBecause I had the TV on, I was able to stop them from cutting two hundred and fifty police officers out of my budget.â As they discussed individual city employees, Newsom kept glancing at the TV. âI really, seriously am concerned that you are watching the Board of Supervisors,â he finally declared. âRise above!â\n\nâI just have it on as backgroundââ\n\nâNo! Shut it off!â\n\nBreed, unruffled, resumed talking about a homeless encampment on Mission Street. âEight people, and only two of them accepted our help,â she said.\n\nNewsom frowned, thinking of Quan, the young man with the orange hairbrush. âI wishâI wish you could have been there when we met one of those kids out in the Tenderloin,â he said. Maybe together they could have brought Quan around. On the other hand, as his advisers kept reminding him, he wasnât about to be elected mayor of California. He, too, needed to rise above.\n\nNewsom leaned in across his old desk and said, âI just want to warn youâit goes fast. Like _that_. You have no idea, but youâre the future ex-mayor.â\n\nBreedâs chief of staff, whoâd come in to wind up the meeting, frowned and said, âSheâs got nine more years.â\n\nâNo,â Newsom said. âIt goes so fast.â\n\nOutside the mayoral suite, he stood for a moment on the landing. âCandidly, listening to her was like listening to me,â he said. âI remember those emotions.â In 2004, Newsom had told me that he could easily step away after one term: âPolitics is life-consuming, but itâs not a life.â When I reminded him of that, he replied, âItâs become my identity.â Newsomâs cousin Jeremy Scherer told me, âWhatâs enamoring to Gavin about politics is that itâs impossible and you never win. Thereâs always someone who hates you and says youâre doing a terrible job.â\n\nNewsom gazed up into the buildingâs marble dome. Did he get smaller, or did the problems get bigger? You enter politics to change lives, and you end up hoping just to save your own. âI always imagined what it would be like to leave this office,â he said. âI thought it would be powerful, but the minute I swore in Ed Lee as the next mayor, literally seconds later, every reporter is running toward Ed Lee, every staffer is running toward him, and I remember walking down these stairs alone. Ed never called me, my staff didnât call meânobody. All that energy, over in a _nanosecond_.â He shivered, draped his jacket over his shoulder, and loped downstairs to the S.U.V. waiting to speed him on his way to being the future ex-governor of California.Â â¦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dfc7e716b454591af22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Governors","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"governors"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a81ab3335f580f18c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politicians","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politicians"},{"id":"5c2e1c972710c62d1081544c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"California","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"california"},{"id":"5c2e1ca52710c62d10815469","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Midterm Elections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"midterm-elections"},{"id":"5c2e1c7741e4c73c088d774d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democrats","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democrats"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"5910ee07dd6207318b5de389","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Political Scene","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-political-scene"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a035a019dfc3494ea416a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Tad Friend has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1998.
