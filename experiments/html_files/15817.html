<p><font face="Open Sans"><b>KEY FINDINGS</b></font></p>
<p><b>The US firearm suicide rate is 10 times that of other high-income countries.</b><span class="f_note">Grinshteyn E, Hemenway D. Violent death rates in the US compared to those of the other high-income countries, 2015. <i>Preventive Medicine</i>. 2019;123:20–26. </span></p>
<p>Americans should be aware of the prevalence of firearm suicide, how having access to a gun increases the risk of suicide, and steps they can take to mitigate risk. A review and statistical analysis of 14 different scientific studies concluded that having access to a firearm triples one’s risk of death by suicide. This elevated risk applies not only to the gun owner, but to everyone in the household.<span class="f_note">Anglemyer A, Horvath T, Rutherford G. The accessibility of firearms and risk for suicide and homicide victimization among household members: a systematic review and meta-analysis. <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>. 2014;160:101–110.</span> People who live in US states with high rates of household gun ownership are also almost four times more likely to die by gun suicide than those in states where fewer households have guns. This relationship remains strong even when controlling for other factors associated with suicide, like poverty, unemployment, serious mental illness, and substance abuse.<span class="f_note">Miller M, Lippman SJ, Azrael D, and Hemenway D. Household firearm ownership and rates of suicide across the 50 United States. <i>Journal of Trauma Injury, Infection, and Critical Care</i>. 2007;62(4):1029–35.</span></p>
<p><b>While firearms are used in less than six percent of suicide attempts, over half of suicide deaths are with firearms.<span class="f_note">Miller M, Azrael D, Barber C.

<p>There is a popular misconception that suicide is inevitable, that suicidal ideation is a permanent condition. But most people who attempt suicide do not die—unless they use a gun. Across all suicide attempts not involving a firearm, less than 5 percent will result in death.<span class="f_note">Vyrostek SB, Annest JL, Ryan GW.

Suicide mortality in the United States: the importance of attending to method in understanding population-level disparities in the burden of suicide. <i>Annual Review of Public Health</i>. 2012;33:393–408. </span> But for gun suicide, those statistics are flipped: Approximately 85 percent of gun suicide attempts end in death.<span class="f_note">Miller M, Azrael D, Hemenway D.

<p><b>Firearm suicides follow sharply divergent demographic patterns.</b><br/>
Men, white Americans, and those living in rural areas are disproportionately affected. Men represent 86 percent of firearm suicide victims; they are six times more likely than women to die by firearm suicide.<span class="f_note">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) Fatal Injury Reports.

Racial and ethnic breakdowns developed using five years of most recent available data: 2013 to 2017.

<p><font face="Open Sans"><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></font></p>
<p>Policies and practices that focus on disrupting access to firearms can reduce firearm suicides. These include:</p>
<p><b>Building public awareness about the suicide risk posed by firearm access.</b></p>
<p>Most gun-owning Americans think their firearms make them safer.<span class="f_note">Igielnik R, Brown A. Key takeaways on Americans’ views of guns and gun ownership. Pew Research Center. June 22, 2017. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191218093539/https://pewrsr.ch/2sZzPjv" target="_blank">https://pewrsr.ch/2sZzPjv</a>. </span> The reality is that access to a firearm increases the risk of suicide for all people in the household.<span class="f_note">Anglemyer A, Horvath T, Rutherford G. The accessibility of firearms and risk for suicide and homicide victimization among household members: a systematic review and meta-analysis. <i>Annals of Internal Medicine.</i> 2014;160:101–110.</span> In the absence of public health campaigns led by the federal government, trusted experts like law enforcement, gun dealers, and medical professionals have all launched campaigns that help inform Americans about the risks of firearms in the home and how to mitigate those risks. For example, through a program called the Gun Shop Project, dozens of gun shops nationwide have begun displaying and distributing materials with information about the risks of firearm access—particularly as it pertains to suicide.<span class="f_note">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Gun Shop Project. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191218093539/https://bit.ly/2c4QKah" target="_blank">https://bit.ly/2c4QKah</a>. Accessed August 27, 2019.</span></p>
<p>Physicians and other medical professionals are also crucial sources of information about the risk of firearm access. By asking their patients about firearm access and counseling about firearm suicide risk, medical professionals may help prevent these deaths. Counseling on Access to Lethal Means, or CALM, is one example of a program that trains medical professionals on how to explain the differing lethality of various suicide methods and to “help clients at risk for suicide and their families reduce access to lethal means, particularly firearms.”<span class="f_note">Counseling on Access to Lethal Means (CALM). Suicide Prevention Resource Center. <a _blank="" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191218093539/https://bit.ly/2tmlUCr target=">https://bit.ly/2tmlUCr</a>. Accessed June 20, 2018.</span></p>
<p><b>Limiting the easy and immediate acquisition of firearms.</b></p>
<p>Policies and practices that disrupt the easy and immediate acquisition of firearms have been shown to save lives. States with permit-to-purchase (PTP) laws, which require an individual to obtain a permit in addition to a background check when buying a handgun, see reductions in firearm suicide.<span class="f_note">Federal law requires criminal background checks for all guns purchased from a licensed firearms dealer and does not cover any sales by unlicensed sellers. A total of 20 states (and Washington, DC) have closed that critical gap for handguns, passing laws that require some form of a background check before a handgun purchase. Seven of those states require the check only pursuant to a purchase permitting process, nine require a background check only at the point of purchase, and four require background checks both in order to obtain a permit and also at the point of sale. Crifasi CK, Meyers JS, Vernick JS, Webster DW. Effects of changes in permit-to-purchase handgun laws in Connecticut and Missouri on suicide rates. <i>Preventive Medicine.</i> 2015;79:43–49.</span> Connecticut’s enactment of PTP and comprehensive point-of-sale background check laws were associated with a 15 percent decline in the firearm suicide rate over the following decade.<span class="f_note">Ibid.</span> By contrast, when Missouri repealed its PTP law, the state experienced a 16 percent increase in the firearm suicide rate over the following five years.<span class="f_note">Ibid.</span></p>
<p>A mandatory waiting period may also help prevent firearm suicides. A waiting-period law requires a certain number of days to elapse between the purchase of a firearm and when the purchaser can actually take possession of that firearm. Policies that create this buffer are associated with reduced rates of firearm suicide.<span class="f_note">Luca M, Malhotra D, Poliquin C. Handgun waiting periods reduce gun deaths. <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.</i> 2017;114(46):12162–12165. Anestis MD, Anestis JC, Butterworth SE.

<p><b>Encouraging the secure storage of firearms in the home to prevent access by children and other unauthorized users.</b></p>
<p>Secure firearm storage can help mitigate the risks of firearm suicide, especially for children.<span class="f_note">Grossman DC, Mueller BA, Riedy C, et al. Gun storage practices and risk of youth suicide and unintentional firearm injuries. <i>Journal of the American Medical Association.</i> 2015;293(6):707–714.</span> Approximately 4.6 million American children live in households with at least one loaded, unlocked firearm.<span class="f_note">Azrael D, Cohen J, Salhi C, Miller M. Firearm storage in gun-owning households with children: results of a 2015 national survey. <i>Journal of Urban Health.</i> 2018;95(3):295–304. Study defined children as under 18. </span> When American children die by firearm suicide, over 80 percent use a gun belonging to a family member.<span class="f_note">Johnson RM, Barber C, Azrael D, Clark DE, Hemenway D. Who are the owners of firearms used in adolescent suicides? <i>Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior.</i> 2010;40(6):609–611. Study defined children as under 18.</span> One study found that households that locked both firearms and ammunition were associated with a 78 percent lower risk of self-inflicted firearm injuries and an 85 percent lower risk of unintentional firearm injuries among children, compared to those that locked neither.<span class="f_note">Grossman DC, Mueller BA, Riedy C, et al. Gun storage practices and risk of youth suicide and unintentional firearm injuries. <i>Journal of the American Medical Association.</i> 2005;293(6):707–714.</span> And researchers estimate that if half of households that store at least one unlocked gun moved to lock all of their guns, 251 youth fatalities from firearm suicide and unintentional shootings could be prevented in a single year. These lives saved would make up one-third of all preventable youth deaths from firearm suicide and unintentional shootings that year.<span class="f_note">Monuteaux MC, Azrael D, Miller M.

<p><b>Creating mechanisms to temporarily remove firearms from individuals in moments of crisis.</b></p>
<p>To protect individuals in crisis, several states have passed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191218093539/https://everytownresearch.org/extreme-risk-laws/" style="color:#ff9e18" target="_blank">Extreme Risk laws</a> as a way to temporarily remove firearm access. Extreme Risk laws give family members and law enforcement a way to intervene before warning signs escalate into tragedies. These laws permit immediate family members and law enforcement to petition a court for an order to temporarily remove guns from dangerous situations. If a court finds that a person poses a serious risk of injuring themselves or others with a firearm, that person is temporarily prohibited from purchasing and possessing guns, and any guns they already own are held by law enforcement or another authorized party while the order is in effect. At the time of publication, 17 states and DC have Extreme Risk laws in place.<span class="f_note">Cal. Penal Code § 18125; Cal. Penal Code § 18150; Cal. Penal Code § 18175; CO HB 1177 (2019); Conn.
