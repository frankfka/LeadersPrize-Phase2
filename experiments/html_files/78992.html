<p>Bob Sayner is co-founder of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111202151140/http://www.justice-2000.org/">Justice 2000</a>, a division of Community Advocates established in 2001 to promote the expansion of opportunities for the safe release and community reintegration of criminal offenders. This mission is based on the belief that social services and treatment interventions, when combined with community supervision, can be useful, effective alternatives to incarceration and should be considered for wider application in Milwaukee, and throughout the state of Wisconsin and the nation.</p>
<p>From 1971-97 he served as Assistant Executive Director of Wisconsin Correctional Services (now known as Wisconsin Community Services [WCS]). During his tenure at WCS, Bob provided the leadership needed to develop, establish and manage Circuit and Municipal Court Intervention Services in the Milwaukee area for criminal offenders and indigent ordinance violators with mental health and substance use disorder problems, a program that evolved into a comprehensive Milwaukee County Pretrial Services Program. In 1994 and 1995, the Pretrial Services Program, operated by WCS was nationally recognized as an “Enhanced Model Pretrial Services Program by the Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance, deemed worthy of replication in other jurisdictions throughout the nation. </p>
<p>Bob also provided the leadership to develop, establish and manage a comprehensive Mental Health Community Support and Treatment Program designed to assist offenders with mental illness and co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorder to function and live independently in the community as an alternative to institutionalization. In 1994, the WCS Community Support Program received national honors as a finalist for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government “Innovations in Government” award and was the subject of a National Institute Journal profile published by the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>In 1998, Bob received the “Olgiatti” award presented in Philadelphia by the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies for lifetime achievement “in recognition for continuing outstanding contributions to the furtherance of the principals of pretrial justice.” </p>
<p>Bob is currently collaborating with the Community Advocates Public Policy Institute to support the Community Justice Project, designed to reduce spending on corrections, control growth in Wisconsin’s prison and jail populations, hold offenders accountable and increase public safety.<br/>
