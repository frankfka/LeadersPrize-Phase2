week after Rick Scott called for the U.S. military to intervene in Venezuela amid Juan Guaidó’s attempt to oust Nicolas Maduro from power, the U.S. Senate’s biggest hawk on Venezuela is calling for more.Scott said Wednesday that the U.S. should consider a naval blockade of Cuba to enforce existing sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, which remains under Maduro’s control. Scott’s announcement is the latest escalation in rhetoric after Guaidó failed to oust Maduro last week.“It’s clear that the United States needs to consider using naval assets to block the flow of oil between the two dictatorships,” Scott said. “The President has floated the idea of a full embargo on Cuba. I agree with him wholeheartedly. We need to take action NOW to capitalize on Maduro’s weakness and end his brutal regime. Cut off Cuba, and you cut off the political forces supporting genocide in Venezuela.”Scott said last week that the U.S. should use military assets to break down barriers erected by Maduro at the Venezuelan border, and assist in the distribution of humanitarian aid. He did not characterize his remarks as invading Venezuela, but such an action would pit U.S. troops against the Maduro-controlled military.He said oil sanctions, announced after the U.S. recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader in January, aren’t working.“It’s clear the sanctions meant to block the flow of oil from Venezuela to Cuba aren’t working,” Scott said. “Cuba is the most powerful force propping up the Maduro regime in Venezuela in large part because of the free oil they’re receiving in return. It’s oil for repression. Cutting off the supply of oil to the Castro Regime would be the most effective action we can take to end the brutal regime of Nicolas Maduro.”The Treasury Department announced a round of sanctions in April on Venezuela’s oil industry and foreign companies that operate oil transport vessels between Venezuela and Cuba.Scott’s comments came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was working with Cuba to establish free and fair elections in Venezuela.“We are working very diligently to ensure that Maduro leaves and we get free and fair elections in Venezuela,” Pompeo said Sunday during an appearance on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “That will require the 2,300 Cuban security personnel, frankly the people closest to Maduro who are protecting ... Maduro, they’ve got to leave. We’re working with the Cubans to try and get an outcome that will let the Venezuelans have this opportunity.”Scott’s calls for intervention in Venezuela have received criticism from some conservatives close to President Donald Trump, though many Venezuelans in South Florida support increased U.S. involvement. And while South Florida lawmakers criticize Russia’s military presence in Venezuela, Trump said Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want to become involved in Venezuela.“He is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela,” Trump said.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20190929232017/https://www.tampabay.com/pf/resources/images/logos/tampa-bay-times-logo.jpg?d=87","caption":"The

class="article__body" id="articleBody"><section><p class="">A week after Rick Scott called for the U.S. military to intervene in Venezuela amid Juan Guaidó’s attempt to oust Nicolas Maduro from power, the U.S. Senate’s biggest hawk on Venezuela is calling for more.</p><p class="">Scott said Wednesday that the U.S. should consider a naval blockade of Cuba to enforce existing sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, which remains under Maduro’s control. Scott’s announcement is the latest escalation in rhetoric after Guaidó failed to oust Maduro last week.</p><p class="">“It’s clear that the United States needs to consider using naval assets to block the flow of oil between the two dictatorships,” Scott said. “The President has floated the idea of a full embargo on Cuba. I agree with him wholeheartedly. We need to take action NOW to capitalize on Maduro’s weakness and end his brutal regime. Cut off Cuba, and you cut off the political forces supporting genocide in Venezuela.”</p><div class="vert html-advertisement inline-vert"><div class="vert__ad" id="AdditionalMediumRectangle"></div></div><p class="">Scott said last week that the U.S. should use military assets to break down barriers erected by Maduro at the Venezuelan border, and assist in the distribution of humanitarian aid. He did not characterize his remarks as invading Venezuela, but such an action would pit U.S. troops against the Maduro-controlled military.</p><p class="">He said oil sanctions, announced after the U.S. recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader in January, aren’t working.</p><p class="">“It’s clear the sanctions meant to block the flow of oil from Venezuela to Cuba aren’t working,” Scott said. “Cuba is the most powerful force propping up the Maduro regime in Venezuela in large part because of the free oil they’re receiving in return. It’s oil for repression. Cutting off the supply of oil to the Castro Regime would be the most effective action we can take to end the brutal regime of Nicolas Maduro.”</p><p class="">The Treasury Department announced a round of sanctions in April on Venezuela’s oil industry and foreign companies that operate oil transport vessels between Venezuela and Cuba.</p><p class="">Scott’s comments came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. was working with Cuba to establish free and fair elections in Venezuela.</p><p class="">“We are working very diligently to ensure that Maduro leaves and we get free and fair elections in Venezuela,” Pompeo said Sunday during an appearance on the CBS program “Face the Nation.” “That will require the 2,300 Cuban security personnel, frankly the people closest to Maduro who are protecting ...

I hail from Arizona, a state that raised me to love tacos al pastor and the sound of hiking boots hitting the dirt. Now, I’m based in Tallahassee, where the Tampa Bay Times shares a bureau with the Miami Herald, and I’m proud to work for two of the state’s strongest newspapers. When it comes to policy, I focus on education and criminal justice – two areas where government unequivocally shapes peoples’ lives. Want to discuss a story idea?

I was inspired by the vivid stories of people from every corner of the world. It was a natural evolution that I ended up studying photojournalism at the University of Florida. I joined Times Publishing Company in 1998, and began documenting storytelling moments for our daily reports – spot news, features, sports, portraiture, food, fashion, etc. My secret (to success): stay focused on the most storytelling elements while remaining open to the unexpected. Photojournalism can also be creative, and I believe it’s my passion to create, along with my personality - adventurous, intense, tenacious, compassionate, confident, patient, curious, evolving - that inspires me to get up each day and do it all over again.","slug":"douglas-r-clifford","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2019-09-04T16:14:00.036Z","middleName":"R.","custom_phone":"(727) 445-4177","twitter":"@cliftimestweet","author_type":"Times Staff Photographer","custom_tagline":"Contact Douglas R.

I aim to tell stories that matter to you now, or will, or should. One day that might involve a police horse that paints, another how county officials spend your tax dollars. I'm from Rhode Island and will talk to you about it. I've coached youth baseball -- yes, the loud one. Okay, maybe I was checking the score on my phone under the table. I'm sorry.

From the Legislative session to state elections, life is fast-paced in the nation’s largest swing state – and I prefer it that way. I hail from Arizona, a state that raised me to love tacos al pastor and the sound of hiking boots hitting the dirt. Now, I’m based in Tallahassee, where the Tampa Bay Times shares a bureau with the Miami Herald, and I’m proud to work for two of the state’s strongest newspapers. When it comes to policy, I focus on education and criminal justice – two areas where government unequivocally shapes peoples’ lives. Want to discuss a story idea?

a general assignment reporter, I’ve been assigned, generally, to learn more about the community that raised me. Aside from four years at Duke University, where I double-majored in English and basketball yelling, I’ve lived all my life in Florida. As a reporter, I’m interested in how the decisions of people in power affect everyday Floridians, and in building community around storytelling. I joined the Times in September 2017, and I spent my first year on the politics team covering the 2018 governor’s race. When I’m not in the office, I like to travel, sing show tunes and dream about playing for the Boston Red Sox.

Ron DeSantis has reshaped the Florida Supreme Court. Now he’s targeting one of the most obscure groups of judges in the state. On Tuesday, the Cabinet one of DeSantis’ own lawyers to be the new chief judge of the state’s Division of Administrative Hearings, after pressuring the previous Jeb Bush-era chief judge to resign. The division’s judges are supposed to provide a check on state agencies, overseeing challenges to rules and deciding billion-dollar bid disputes. But this new chief judge, who hails from the same Federalist Society stock that Republicans have used to fill judicial seats across the country, is already talking about stripping away powers the judges have had since the 1970s. Former judges and observers are alarmed. “That just means to me that people are deciding cases somebody doesn’t like,” said former judge Jim York. York said administrations in the past have meddled with the court to ensure rulings favorable to their donors and constituents.
