<i>A.  There is hereby created in the state treasury a special nonreverting fund
to be known as the Priority Transportation Fund, hereafter referred to as “the
Fund.”  The Fund shall be established on the books of the Comptroller. 
Interest earned on moneys in the Fund shall remain in the Fund and be credited
to it.  All funds as may be designated in the appropriation act for deposit to
the Fund shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the Fund.  Such
funds shall include:</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>1.  A portion of the moneys actually collected, including penalty and interest,

the difference between such tax revenues collected in the manner prescribed under
Chapter 22 less such tax revenues that would have been collected using the
prescribed manner in effect before the effective date of Chapter 22.  The
portion to be deposited to the Fund shall be the moneys actually collected from
such increase in revenues and allocated for highway and mass transit
improvement projects as set forth in § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.03C2">33.1-23.03:2</a>, but not including any

Title 58.1; and</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>2.  Beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, and for fiscal years
thereafter, all revenues that exceed the official forecast, pursuant to §
<a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.1-393">2.1-393</a>, for (i) the Highway Maintenance and Operating Fund and (ii) the allocation
to highway and mass transit improvement projects as set forth in §
<a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.03C2">33.1-23.03:2</a>, but not including any amounts that are allocated to the Commonwealth
Port Fund and the Commonwealth Airport Fund under such section; and</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>3.  Any other such funds as may be transferred, allocated, or appropriated.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The Fund shall be considered a part of the Transportation Trust Fund. Any
moneys remaining in the Fund, including interest thereon, at the end of each
fiscal year shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the Fund. 
Moneys in the Fund shall be used solely for the purposes enumerated in
subsection B of this section.  Expenditures and disbursements from the Fund
shall be made by the State Treasurer on warrants issued by the Comptroller.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>B. The Commonwealth Transportation Board shall use the Fund to facilitate the
financing of priority transportation projects throughout the Commonwealth. The Board
may use the Fund either (i) by expending amounts therein on such projects
directly, (ii) by payment to any authority, locality, commission or other
entity for the purpose of paying the costs thereof, or (iii) by using such
amounts to support, secure, or leverage financing for such projects.  No
expenditures from or other use of amounts in the Fund shall be considered in
allocating highway maintenance and construction funds under § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.1">33.1-23.1</a> or

addition thereto. The Board shall use the Fund to facilitate the financing of
priority transportation projects as designated by the General Assembly;

allocated among  projects within the same transportation district as needed to
meet construction cash-flow needs.</i>

Commonwealth to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatever or to make any
appropriation for their payment, other than to appropriate available funds
derived as revenues under this article from the sources set forth in clauses

</p>
<p>
The bonds of such issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or
rates and shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding forty years from
their date or dates, as may be determined by the Board or by formula or method
established by resolution of the Board, and may be made redeemable before
maturity, at the option of the Board, at such price or prices and under such
terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board prior to the issuance of the
bonds. The principal <i>or purchase price of, </i>and <i>redemption premium, if any, and
</i>interest <s>of </s><i>on, </i>such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The
payments of principal and interest may be uniform in amount over the life of
the bond; however, such uniformity shall not be a prerequisite to the issuance
of such bonds. The Board shall determine the form of the bonds, including any
interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or
denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and
interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without
the Commonwealth. The bonds shall be signed by the <s>Commonwealth Transportation
Commissioner </s><i>chairman or</i> <i> vice-chairman of the Board </i>and the official seal of
the Board shall be affixed thereto and attested by the secretary <i>or assistant
secretary </i>of the Board and any coupons attached thereto shall bear the
facsimile signatures of the<s> Commonwealth Transportation Commissioner</s><i> chairman
or vice-chairman of the Board</i>. When any officer whose signature appears on the
bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such
signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if
<s>he </s><i>such officer </i>had remained in office until such delivery. All revenue
bonds issued under the provisions of this article shall have and are hereby declared to have, as
between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable
instruments under the negotiable instruments law of the Commonwealth. Such
bonds and the income thereof shall be exempt from all taxation within the
Commonwealth. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both,
as the Board may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of
any coupon bond as to principal alone and also as to both principal and
interest and for the reconversion of any bonds registered as to both principal
and interest into coupon bonds. Prior to the preparation of definite bonds, the
Board, under like restrictions, may issue temporary bonds with or without
coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The
Board may also provide for the replacement of any bond which is mutilated,
destroyed or lost.

</p>
<p>
The Board may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may
determine to be for the best interests of the Commonwealth, but no such sale
shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the
money received therefor at more than <s>six </s><i>the maximum </i>per centum per annum<i>
approved by the Commonwealth Treasury Board with respect to such obligations in
accordance with § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+2.1-179">2.1-179</a> of the Code of Virginia, as amended</i>, computed with
relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond
values, excluding, however, from such computations the amount of any premium to be paid on
redemption for any bonds prior to maturity.
</p>
<p>
All bonds heretofore or hereafter issued pursuant to the authority of this
article are hereby made securities in which all public officers and bodies of
this Commonwealth and all political subdivisions thereof, all insurance
companies and associations, all national banks and trust companies, and savings
institutions, including savings and loan associations, in the Commonwealth, and
all executors, administrators, trustees, and other fiduciaries, both individual
or corporate, may properly and legally invest funds within their control.

§ <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-284">33.1-284</a>. Trust indenture.
</p>
<p>
In the discretion of the Board, each or any issue of revenue bonds may be
secured by a trust indenture by and between the Board and a corporate trustee,
which may be any trust company or bank having <s>the </s><i>trust </i>powers <s>of a trust
company </s>within or outside of the Commonwealth. Such trust indenture may pledge
tolls and revenues to be received, but no such trust indenture shall convey or
mortgage any project or any part thereof. Either the resolution providing for
the issuance of revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such
provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the
bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law,
including covenants setting forth the duties of the Board in relation to the
acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation, repair and
insurance of the projects and the custody, safeguarding and application of all
moneys. Such resolution or trust indenture may also provide that the project or
projects shall be acquired, or acquired and improved, or constructed, and paid
for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or
designated by the Board and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the
bonds issued therefor and may also require that the security given by
contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of
the project or projects or other moneys pertaining thereto be satisfactory to
such purchasers. Any bank or trust company <s>incorporated under the laws of this
</s><i>within or outside of the </i>Commonwealth may act as such depository and
furnish such indemnifying bonds or pledge such securities as may be required by the
Board. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders
and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action of
bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures
of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, such trust indenture may contain
such other provisions as the Board may deem reasonable and proper for the
security of the bondholders. Except as in this article otherwise provided, the
Board may provide, by resolution or by such trust indenture, that after the
payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the
project or projects into the state treasury the Board will immediately transfer
or pay same over to such officer, board or depository as it may determine for
the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such
safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in
carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of
maintenance, operation and repairs of the project or projects affected by such
indenture.

<p>
2.  That the Commonwealth Transportation Board is authorized, by and with the
consent of the Governor, to issue Commonwealth of Virginia Federal Highway
Reimbursement Anticipation Notes, as follows:
</p>
<p>
Whereas, Section 9 (d) of Article X of the Constitution of Virginia and §§
<a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-267">33.1-267</a> through <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-295">33.1-295</a> of the Code of Virginia, as amended, provide that the General
Assembly may authorize the issuance of bonds or notes secured and payable subject to
appropriations therefor by the General Assembly; and
</p>
<p>
Whereas, in accordance with the National Highway System Designation Act of
1995, and the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, states
may issue Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles which are securities issued in
anticipation of, and payable from, federal reimbursements with respect to
federal aid transportation projects; and 
</p>
<p>
Whereas, utilizing Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles, to be designated as
Commonwealth of Virginia Federal Highway Reimbursement Anticipation Notes, on
an ongoing basis to finance projects included in the Commonwealth
Transportation Board’s Six-Year Improvement Program will accelerate
transportation projects that improve safety, reduce congestion, and stimulate
economic development; now, therefore, 
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 1. This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "Commonwealth of Virginia
Federal Highway Reimbursement Anticipation Notes Act of 2000."</i>

obligations of the Commonwealth to be designated “Commonwealth of Virginia
Federal Highway Reimbursement Anticipation Notes, Series ….,” provided that the

(including, without limitation, any original issue discount) (the Notes).  The
net proceeds of the Notes shall be used exclusively for the purpose of
providing funds, together with any other available funds, for paying the costs,
 incurred or to be incurred for construction or funding of such projects to be
designated from time to time by the General Assembly; provided, however, at the
discretion of the Commonwealth Transportation Board, funds allocated to
projects within a transportation district may be allocated among  projects
within the same transportation district as needed to meet construction
cash-flow needs. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 3.  The proceeds of Notes, including any premium received on the sale
thereof, shall be made available by the Commonwealth Transportation Board to
pay costs of the projects and, where appropriate, may be paid to any authority,
locality, commission or other entity for the purposes of paying for costs of
the projects.  The proceeds of Notes may be used together with any federal,
local or private funds which may be made available for such purpose.  The
proceeds of Notes, together with any investment earnings thereon, may at the
discretion of the Commonwealth Transportation Board secure the payment of
principal or purchase price of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on
Notes.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 4. The terms and structure of each issue of Notes shall be determined by the
Commonwealth Transportation Board, subject to approval by the Treasury Board in

each issue shall be dated, shall be issued in a principal amount (subject to the
limitation as to amount outstanding at any one time set forth in § 2), shall
bear interest at such rate or rates which may be fixed, adjustable, variable or a
combination thereof, and may be determined by a formula or other method, shall
mature at such time or times not exceeding ten years after the issuance
thereof, and may be made subject to purchase or redemption before their
maturity or maturities, at such price or prices and under such terms and
conditions, all as may be determined by the Commonwealth Transportation Board.
The Commonwealth Transportation Board shall determine the form of Notes,
whether Notes are certificated or uncertificated, and fix the authorized
denomination or denominations of Notes and the place or places of payment of
principal or purchase price of, and redemption premium, if any, and interest
on, Notes, which may be at the office of the State Treasurer or any bank or
trust company within or without the Commonwealth.  The principal or purchase
price of, and redemption premium, if any, and interest on, Notes shall be made
payable in lawful money of the United States of America.  Each issue of Notes
may be issued under a system of book entry for recording the ownership and
transfer of ownership of rights to receive payments of principal or purchase
price of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on such Notes.  All Notes
shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all
the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the negotiable
instruments law of the Commonwealth.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The Commonwealth Transportation Board may sell Notes from time to time at
public or private sale, by competitive bidding, negotiated sale or private
placement, for such price or prices as it may determine to be in the best
interests of the Commonwealth.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 5. The Notes shall be signed on behalf of the Commonwealth Transportation
Board by the chairman or vice-chairman of the Commonwealth Transportation
Board, or shall bear the facsimile signature of such officer, and shall bear
the official seal of the Board, which shall be attested by the manual or
facsimile signature of the secretary or assistant secretary of the Commonwealth
Transportation Board.  In the event that Notes shall bear the facsimile
signature of the  chairman or vice chairman of the Commonwealth Transportation
Board, such Notes shall be signed by such administrative assistant as the
chairman of the Transportation Board shall determine or by any registrar/paying
agent that may be designated by the Commonwealth Transportation Board.  In case
any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any
Notes shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such Notes, such
signature or facsimile signature nevertheless shall be valid and sufficient for
all purposes as if such officer had remained in office until such delivery.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 6. All expenses incurred under this Act or in connection with issuance of
Notes shall be paid from the proceeds of such Notes or from any available funds as the
Commonwealth Transportation Board shall determine.</i>

Code of Virginia, as amended, and shall be disbursed only for the purpose for which
such Notes and such anticipation notes shall be issued; provided, however, proceeds
derived from the sale of Notes herein authorized shall be first used in the

and of any anticipation notes herein authorized, together with any investment
earnings thereon, shall not be taken into account in computing, and shall be in

4.  That in addition to the amounts paid from the general fund pursuant to §
<a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+58.1-815">58.1-815</a> of the Code of Virginia, from July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002,
there is hereby appropriated $379,931,000 from the general fund for
transportation purposes as follows:
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 1.  From July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002, $20,585,038 in the first fiscal
year and $14,700,000 in the second fiscal year shall be appropriated to the
mass transit assistance program for a statewide new transit vehicle and
equipment program to be administered by the Department of Rail and Public
Transportation.  In addition to the amounts from the general fund, $6,646,962
in the first fiscal year and $10,354,962 in the second fiscal year from federal
highway funds shall be appropriated to this program.  Such federal funds, as
apportioned under Title 23 of the United States Code, shall be derived from six
percent of surface transportation program funds allocated pursuant to §
<a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.1">33.1-23.1</a> of the Code of Virginia and ten percent from minimum guarantee program
funds in each fiscal year with an additional $4,000,000 in minimum guarantee funds
allocated to the Virginia Railway Express in the first fiscal year by action of
the Commonwealth Transportation Board.  The statewide new transit vehicle and
equipment program shall be a competitive grant program with no less than
$1,300,000 for the Hampton Roads Innovative Regional Bus Plan in the first
fiscal year and no less than $1,300,000 for the Greater Richmond Transit
Company (GRTC) new or extended bus service in each fiscal year.  The Program
shall include both suburban and rural small transit systems and be on a
statewide basis.  The Commonwealth Transportation Board, at its discretion, may
apply subdivision 4 f of § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+58.1-638">58.1-638</a> to allocate all funds in this section.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 2.  From July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, $25,000,000 shall be
appropriated to the Virginia Airports Revolving Loan Fund pursuant to Chapter
2.1 (§ <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+5.1-30.1">5.1-30.1</a> et seq.) of Title 5.1 of the Code of Virginia. </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 3.  From July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002, $5,000,000 to the airport
assistance program administered by the Department of Aviation for a statewide competitive
capital grant program for privately owned designated reliever airports,
privately owned local service airports, and privately owned community service
airports.  The Department of Aviation shall develop guidelines for such program
and implement the program effective July 1, 2001.  The Department of Aviation
shall report on such guidelines, criteria, and performance measures for the
program to the 2002 Session of the General Assembly.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 4.  From July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, $2,000,000 shall be designated
to the Smithsonian Institution for the "Virginia Appropriation" pursuant to the
requirements of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and
the Smithsonian Institution concerning the National Air and Space Museum
Extension.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 5.  From July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002, $3,052,000 shall be
appropriated to the water transportation system planning program administered by the
Virginia Port Authority.  From these appropriations, $1,500,000 the first fiscal year and
$852,000 the second fiscal year shall be used for matching funds required by
the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (Public Law <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+99-262">99-262</a>), as amended,
for a study of the eastward expansion of the federally owned Craney Island
Dredged Material Management Area.  In addition, from these appropriations,
$500,000 in the first fiscal year and $200,000 in the second fiscal year shall
be used to begin the dredging of the inbound channel of the Norfolk Harbor
Channel.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>§ 6. A. From July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2002, $239,284,000 the first fiscal
year and $68,047,000 the second fiscal year shall be appropriated for specified
highway projects around the Commonwealth.  Notwithstanding the provisions of
Article 1.1 (§ <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.01">33.1-23.01</a> et seq.) of Title 33.1 of the Code of Virginia, such
general funds shall be used to ensure that highway construction projects have
sufficient state funds available for payment of the state share of expenditures
in the year the expenditure shall occur.  No expenditure, allocation, or other
use of such amounts in the specific construction district shall be considered
in allocating highway maintenance and construction funds under § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.1">33.1-23.1</a>, but
shall be in addition thereto.  Further, such allocations from the general fund to
interstate projects shall not be defined as "interstate federal-aid match" for
federal fund allocation or matching purposes.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>B.  The Commonwealth Transportation Board may reduce the general fund amount to
any individual project specified in this section of enactment 4 if the Commonwealth
Transportation Commissioner determines, in writing, that an individual project
cannot use such general funds because of environmental, legal, cost
adjustments, or other project management considerations. When such general
funds become available, such funds shall be allocated by the Commonwealth
Transportation Board to another transportation project in the same construction
district.  The Commonwealth Transportation Board shall report such actions to
the chairmen of the House Appropriations and Senate Finance Committees within
30 days of taking such action.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>C. The general fund appropriation in the first fiscal year under this section
shall be allocated to each project to provide the funding identified as "Year 1"
multiplied by 1,000.  The general fund appropriation under this section in the
second fiscal year shall be allocated to each project to provide the funding
identified as "Year 2" and "Year 3" multiplied by 1,000. The Commonwealth
Transportation Board's Six-Year Improvement Program as it existed on January 1,
2000, for the six fiscal years beginning on July 1, 2000, and ending on June
30, 2006, is revised and amended as follows, and the projects to which general
funds shall be allocated pursuant to this section of enactment 4, and the year
of the allocation, are as follows:</i>

5. That, in addition to the general fund appropriations in enactment 4, from

shall allocate pursuant to § <a href="/web/20120729063826/http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+33.1-23.03C8">33.1-23.03:8</a> of this act and the Comptroller shall

<p>
7.  That, as a condition of the financial assistance for projects located in a

<p>
8.  That, insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the

<p>
9. That if any clause, sentence, paragraph, section, or part of this act or the

the remainder hereof but shall be confined to the clause, sentence, paragraph,
section, or part hereof directly involved in the controversy in which such
judgment shall have been rendered, and to this end the provisions of this act
are severable.
</p>
<p>
10.  That beginning July 1, 2002, there shall be deposited in each fiscal year
