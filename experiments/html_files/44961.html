<p align="justify"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Threats_to_Israel/Iran.html#missile">Iran</a> is one of the foremost enemies of the West and its ongoing nuclear program poses the most menacing and serious threat to the stability of the Middle East and the security of the world. In  2012, IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano announced that "what we know [about Iran's nuclear 
                                    program] suggests the development of nuclear weapons."</p>
<p align="justify">The entire world seems to agree that <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/Irantoc.html">Iran</a> should not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons. Since the military 
                                    option to deter Iran is a scenario that few want or believe can work, 
                                    the principal tactic that has been adopted to prevent Iran from creating 
                                    a bomb is sanctions. Imposed either unilaterally or multilaterally, sanctions
                                    are a peaceful and diplomatic avenue to make hardships for the regime 
                                    - both economically and politically - to put them in a situation where 
                                    a choice must be made between continuing the nuclear program or watching 
                                    their country suffer. The sanctions regime has garnered international legitimacy
                                    since the adoption of UN Security 
                                    Council <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unres1737.html">Resolution 1737</a> in December 2006.</p>
<p>Since 2006, the <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/usatoc.html">United States</a> and European Union have been the biggest supporters of sanctions against 
                                    the Iranian regime and have  passed numerous bills to impose ever harsher sanctions. Through their leadership, many international 
                                    shipping agencies, traders, bankers and global insurance companies have 
                                    pulled their dealings with Iran. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, these moves have so 
                                    far done little to deter <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/Irantoc.html">Iran</a> from its nuclear ambitions. Already in  December 2008, then-Iranian Foreign 
                                    Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi's  said that “Iran 
                                    will never suspend uranium enrichment,” blatantly calling out the sanctions regime as either ineffectual or lacking teeth. In June 2013, newly-elected President Hassan Rouhani - who once led Iran's nuclear negotiating team to agree to a suspension of the program in 2003 - reiterated Qashqavi's sentiment when he said that the "era [of suspending enrichment] is behind us."  </p>
<p>The efficacy of the Iran sanctions is already under seige. In testimony before a Senate 
                                    intelligence committee in February 2012, CIA Director James Clapper 
                                    said, "The sanctions as imposed so far have not caused [Iran] to 
                                    change their behavior or their policy." Israeli Prime Minister <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Netanyahutoc.html">Benjamin 
                                      Netanyahu</a> has repeatedly said that sanctions have not done  enough to affect 
                                    a change in Iran's nuclear program and in August 2013 Iranian MP Avaz Heidarpour, a member of the parliament's National Security &amp; Foreign Policy Commission, said that "sanctions have proven ineffective." </p>
<p>History also works against the success of the Iran sanctions.  Simon Henderson, an expert on energy policy in the Middle East, noted, “Iran is unlikely to give up its nuclear program after seeing what happened to Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein, who were both driven from power, after acceding to international pressure to give up their nuclear ambitions."</p>
<p align="justify">The sanctions regime, as it has been constituted, has also been doomed for failure because it has yet to be  implemented correctly and unwaveringly 
                                    supported. The United States specifically has had many issues fully implementing 
                                    sanctions against Iran and, to date, no U.S. Administration has fully implemented any of the sanctions against Iran in place since <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/IranLibya1996.html">1996</a>.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/congtoc.html">Congress</a> has passed a number of bills, and the <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obamatoc.html">White House</a> numerous executive orders, regarding Iran sanctions - - in <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama062410.html">June 
                                    2010</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama112111.html">November 2011</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama020612.html">February 2012</a>,  <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama073112.html">July 2012</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/senate112912.html">November 2012</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/housejan13.html">January 2013</a> and <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama0613.html">June 2013</a> to name the most recent - but the efficacy of these bills have been severely weakened from loopholes or waivers  allowing the U.S. to delay their implementation. President Obama's <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/obama112111.html">Executive Order 13590</a>, for example, was delayed more than six months out of fear it would stimulate a rise in oil prices. Likewise, in March 2012 and again in June 2013, President Obama or the State Department granted exemptions to countries, including Japan and several European nations, to allow them to continue doing limited business with Iran.</p>
<p align="justify">European Union sanctions have similarly fallen  
                                    on mostly deaf ears. The EU has at times been unable to completely restrain 
                                    nations from dealing with Tehran and, more importantly, Iran has been 
                                    one of Europe's major foreign oil exporters. This need for crude oil 
                                    has allowed Iran the maneuverability to get around sanctions, as profit 
                                    from sales lessens the financial impact of sanctions. In January 2012, the EU finally passed an "unprecendented" resolution 
                                    to embargo all Iranian oil and, to support its implementation, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/satoc.html">Saudi Arabia</a>  promised to fulfill Europe's gas needs. </p>
<p align="justify">Also minimizing the impact of sanctions are UN member

                                    for example, have helped the Iranians steer clear of the negative consequences 
                                    that sanctions place on its economy. In April 2012, Turkey and India 
                                    announced that they are looking to lower their trade levels with Iran, 
                                    however Russia and China both vigorously oppose sanctioning the regime. 
                                    In 2012, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that sanctions are "deeply 
                                    mistaken policy" and would be unlikely for Iran to "make any 
                                    concessions or any corrections to its policies” because of sanctions.</p>
<p align="justify">Even with the looming threat of a nuclear Iran, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/chinajews.html">China</a> and other Asian countries continue to support Iran through increasing oil purchases.  In August 2014 it was reported that Asian countries increased oil purchases from Iran by 29.4% in July 2014 compared to purchases in July 2013.  China is the largest consumer of Iranian oil, with 80% of it's Iranian imports consisting of crude oil.  Despite this fact, Iran's largest customers (<a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/chinajews.html">China</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/India.html">India</a>, <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Japan.html">Japan</a>, and <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/south_korea.html">South Korea</a>) purchased 1.029 million barrels per day of Iranian crude oil, the lowest total number in 7 months.  July 2014 marked China's seventh straight month of increasing trade volume with Iran.  </p>
<p align="justify">On November 23, 2013, the P5+1 and Iran reached a set of initial understandings that halts the progress of Iran's nuclear program and rolls it back in key respects. The agreement was hailed as only an interim deal, set for six months, that will give world powers extended time to work with the Islamic Republic on a permanent solution to the nuclear crisis.  Under this deal, in return for cooperation during nuclear negotiations and nuclear power concessions, the P5+1 loosened multiple sanctions against Iran in pursuit of an agreement.  The P5+1 pledged that  the international community will not impose new nuclear-related sanctions on Iran for at least six months from the date of the agreement and will suspend certain sanctions on gold and precious metals, Iran's auto sector, and Iran's petrochemical exports among other things in return for halting Iran's production of enriched uranium.  In addition to this loosening of sanctions, Iran was also promised the release of billions of dollars in international frozen assets.  Due to this loosening of sanctions, during 2014 German exports to Iran skyrocketed 33% compared to falling export numbers in previous years.  Germany is an important trading partner for Iran and this export increase is certainly welcome, especially in the wake of falling German exports to Russia thanks to the Ukraine crisis.  </p>
<p align="justify">The last details of this<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/http://eeas.europa.eu/statements/docs/2013/131124_03_en.pdf"> temporary agreement</a>, known as the Joint Plan of Action (or JPOA) were finalized by the P5+1 on January 12, 2014.  Although this plan was originally rolled out in November of 2013, it was not ready to take effect or finalized until January 2014.  Iran agreed to this temporary halt in uranium production in exchange for foreign aid from the West in the form of sanctions relief totalling $6-$7 billion.  A deal was not reached by the agreed-upon deadline of July 20, 2014, and the nuclear negotiations were extended until  November 24.  </p>
<p align="justify">In late August 2014, it was reported that Iran had been undertaking "mechanical" tests on a new centrifuge system.  Iran claims that both it's new and old centrifuges are not for nuclear weaponization purposes and that it is manufacturing new ones to replace it's old and accident-prone ones.  These new advanced centrifuges could allow Iran to come up with a nuclear weapon at a much faster rate than before.  The interim deal struck between Iran and the P5+1 in November 2013 states that Iran could not go beyond the current centrifuge research and development programs it had in place. In response to these actions taken by Iran, on August 29 President Barack Obama announced new sanctions directed against 25+ organizations, banks and individuals suspected of helping the Iranian government work towards acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities.  US Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David Cohen stated that the sanctions are directed against organizations and individuals that "are involved in expanding Iran's proliferation program, support terrorism in the region, and help Iran evade US and international sanctions".  Some of the groups sanctioned by this action include: Asia Bank, Meraj Air, Caspian Air, Faylaca Petroleum, The Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute, Mandegar Baspar Kimiya Co, and Jahan Tech Rooyan Pars.  Individuals sanctioned by this action include: Sayyed Jabar Hosseini (a senior Iranian official who has supported terrorist activities),  Abdelhak Kaddouri (the financial chief of the National Iranian Oil Co), Mohammad Javad, and Arman Imanirad. </p>
<p align="justify">On Thursday September 4 2014 Japan transferred $1 billion in frozen oil assets to Iran, the first and second installments of the $2.8 billion promised to Iran as a part of the interim deal with the P5+1.  It is estimated that Iran has $100 billion in frozen funds abroad which it does not have open access to due to sanctions.  </p>
<p align="justify">It was revealed late in the afternoon on the deadline of November 24 that the two parties still had significant differences to work out and that no comprehensive nuclear deal had been reached.  After months of intense negotiations between Iran and world superpowers from the P5+1, the two groups could not come to an agreement by the deadline agreed to in July.  The nuclear discussions were once again extended, this time for seven months.  The negotiating teams hope to have a draft agreement by March 1, 2015, with a finalized agreement on the table ready to be accepted by all parties in July. Until a more comprehensive deal is reached, the conditions and stipulations of the current temporary deal  remain in effect.  Following the announcement of an extension of the negotiations, South Korea made a $500 million payment to Iran for crude oil imports.  Under the interim agreement Iran is allowed to access $700 million per month in sanctions relief in the form of oil payments from their frozen international bank accounts. </p>
<p align="justify">In allegations that had been previously unreported, in December 2014 US officials accused Iran of breaching the nuclear sanctions placed on them by the United Nations by secretely seeking to acquire parts for a heavy water reactor that could be used in the production of nuclear weapons grade materials.  US and international monitors  observed "no recent downturn in [Iranian] procurement" activities according to a November 7 report made public in early December.  The extension of the negotiations was good news for countries looking to do business with Iran, and they took advantage of the favorable diplomatic climate.  These accusations were taken with a grain of salt by the international community, as  news like this usually takes a very long time to be released so the accusations may predate the interim agreement, meaning that Iran did not violate the agreement at least in this way.  </p>
<p align="justify">During US President Barack Obama's January 2015 State of the Union address, he warned the new Republican controlled legislature against levying new sanctions on Iran, lest they unravel the progress that has been made in the negotiations so far. The President told the legislators that "New sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails—alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear programme again."  House Speaker John Boehner invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress in January 2015, in hopes of swaying them away from voting in favor of a bad nuclear deal with Iran. </p>
<p align="justify">Democrats in Congress gave Obama and the negotiating teams substantial breathing room on January 27, when they announced that they would hold off on voting or moving any legislation forward that might tighten any penalties or sanctions against Iran until after March 24. Congressmen and government officials hope that this two month timeframe will be enough for the negotiating teams to come to a comprehensive and complete framework for ensuring Iran's nuclear program has only peaceful applications.  Obama has stated that he will veto any sanctions bill that arrives on his desk while the negotiators are still attempting to reach a deal.  </p>
<p align="justify">The US Senate Banking Committee approved the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015 on January 29, 2015, by an 18-4 vote.  The bipartisan legislation was introduced by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Robert Menendez (D-NJ), and although it did not impose any new sanctions on Iran, it increased the pressure on the Iranian regime.  The act set in stone that if there is no agreement reached by the June 30 deadline all of the sanctions that were waived with the acceptance of the interim agreement would be put back in place.  In addition, the act imposes monthly escalating sanctions begining in August should the negotiating teams fail to reach an agreement.  The bill provides for President Obama to be able to shoot down any sanctions activity, should he feel that it would interfere with reaching a comprehensive deal. </p>
<p align="justify">A <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/IranParameters.pdf">framework for a nuclear agreement</a> was reached between Iranian and P5+1 negotiators on April 2, 2015, aimed at curtailing Iran's nuclear ambitions while slowly and steadily decreasing sanctions pressure on the Iranians. The United States lobbied the international community in favor of  the automatic reimposition of sanctions on Iran should they be found to be in violation of the framework agreement. <span class="MsoNormal">Russian officials voiced their opposition to the automatic reimposition of international sanctions if Iran is caught cheating in regards to elements of the proposed nuclear deal. Russias Ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, bluntly stated that “there can be no automaticity, none whatsoever”<span class="style1">(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-13/russia-rejects-automatic-sanctions-return-if-iran-cheats-on-deal" target="_blank">Bloomberg,</a> May 13, 2015)</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span class="MsoNormal">The Islamic Republic of Iran received a 13-ton hoard of gold, worth close to $500 million, that was being held up by sanctions against the country on July 2, 2015. The gold had been purchased prior to the imposition of international sanctions against Iran, and had been stored in South Africa since 2013. The return of the gold reportedly had little to do with the nuclear negotiations, and was worked out in a sideline deal.</span></p>
<p align="justify">Negotiators from the P5+1 and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/Irantoc.html">Iran</a> announced on July 14, 2015, after 20 months of negotiations, that a comprehensive agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear capabilities had been reached, known as the<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/images/Iran/irandeal.pdf"> Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</a>. The final agreement exchanges relief from American and international sanctions for access to Iranian nuclear facilities. and the promise that Iran will not make any more strides towards the development of a nuclear bomb while the agreement is in place. In return for limiting their nuclear program, as part of the deal Iran was slated to receive an estimated $100-$150 billion in frozen assets and oil revenues worldwide due to relief from sanctions. Under the agreement Iran has to provide international inspectors access to suspicious sites within 24 days of their request. If Iran refuses these inspectors access within the 24 day period, international sanctions against Iran can be “snapped back” in place. </p>
<p align="justify">Economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the United Nations Security Council were lifted on January 16, 2016, with the news that Iran had complied with all aspects of the JCPOA.  The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/sctoc1.html">United Nations Security Council </a>received the IAEA report detailing Iran's compliance with the JCPOA on January 16, 2016, triggering an automatic end to most United Nations Sanctions on Iran under <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170102190947/http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11974.doc.htm">UNSCR 2231</a> adopted on July 20, 2015. UNSCR 2231 states that when Iran completes all of the necessary steps to implement the agreement and the IAEA approves, seven Security Council resolutions against Iran will be lifted. The resolution includes an automatic snap-back provision to re-impose sanctions, should Iran be found  in violation of the JCPOA.</p>

The administration originally said the sanctions relief would be relatively low, around $6-7 billion. However, during the negotiations the U.S. backtracked from this opening position and approved much more significant relief in a wide variety of areas: commerce in gold, the Iranian petrochemical industry, the car industry and replacement parts for civilian aircraft. Thus, according to the Israeli sources, the sanctions relief is now worth approximately $20-25 billion.<br/>

Officials warned that spoiling diplomatic talks with Iran would be a "march to war" - "It is important to understand that if pursuing a resolution diplomatically is disallowed or ruled out, what options, then, do we and our allies have to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon?" said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. "The American people do not want a march to war." State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki drove home the point - "Putting new sanctions in place would be a mistake while we're still determining a diplomatic route forward."<br/>

</p><p>- On the eve of a new round of talks with Iran, a senior Obama administration official said that the United States was prepared to offer Iran limited relief from economic sanctions if Tehran agreed to temporarily halt its nuclear program. The official said that the suspension of Iran's nuclear efforts, perhaps for six months, would give negotiators time to pursue a comprehensive and far more challenging agreement. Israel, for its part, rejects the proposal. "Israel thinks this is a bad deal and will oppose it strongly," an Israeli official said.<br/>

<p>- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the leaders of Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron, and France, President Francois Hollande, to urge them not to ease sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program ahead of talks between Iran and world powers. Netanyahu told Cameron and Hollande that the sanctions were close to achieving their goal. "Until Iran dismantles its military nuclear program, sanctions must not be eased - on the contrary. Only the pressure brought Iran to this point, and only the continuation of pressure and its strengthening can bring them to dismantle their nuclear program," Netanyahu was quoted as saying.<br/>

<p>- Officials reponsible for monitoring the U.N. sanctions regime against Iran say that the Islamic Republic has intensified its efforts to circumvent restrictions by strengthening its trading ties with a number of neighboring countries, including Turkey, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. The government has stepped up efforts to acquiring gold and foreign currency that can be used to shore up the rial. For example, Iranian bankers have successfully exploited loopholes in the U.N. sanctions to channel billions of dollars worth of gold from Turkey to the Central Bank of Iran. Iran has also exploited its close relationship with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to acquire foreign currency through a network of Iranian money-changers who are working in major towns and cities in Iraq.<br/>

The companies are: Post Bank Iran, Iran Insurance Company, Good Luck Shipping, Export Development Bank of Iran, Persia International Bank, Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction Co and Bank Refah Kargaran.

<p align="justify">- The European Union banned the import of Iranian 
                                      natural gas into EU countries in an effort to raise the pressure on 
                                      Iran in hope of enticing the country to come to the negotiating table 
                                      ready to discuss its nuclear program in earnest. This latest step 
                                      is part of a new round of sanctions against Iran's banking, shipping, 
                                      and industrial sectors. In the announcement, EU ministers expressed 
                                      "serious and deepening concerns" over Iran's nuclear progress 
                                      and underlined that "the restrictive measures agreed [to] are 
                                      aimed at affecting Iran's nuclear program and revenues of the Iranian 
                                      regime to fund its program and are not aimed at the Iranian people."</p>
<p align="justify">- A leading European satellite provider took 19 Iranian 
                                      television and radio broadcasters off the air due to EU sanctions 
                                      punishing human rights abusers.</p>
<p align="justify">- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected 
                                      that Iran will be able to lower its currently high inflation rate 
                                      despite Western-imposed sanctions. According to the IMF's semi-annual 
                                      World Economic Outlook, Iran's economy will not collapse as a result 
                                      of the strong rounds of economic sanctions, even though they are hurting 
                                      its oil exports severely. However, much of the IMF analysis is based 
                                      on information provided by the Iranian government, which may not be 
                                      entirely accurate. Additionally, the report was filed before the Iranian 
                                      currency, the rial, plummeted by roughly a third against the dollar 
                                      in a mere 10 days through October 2. Nevertheless, IMF experts estimate 
                                      that Iranian unemployment will decline next year and that the country 
                                      will experience a surplus of 2.4% GDP this year and 1.3% next year.</p>

<p align="justify">- In spite of the European Union's inclusion of Iran 
                                      on its sanctions list, the German Academic Exchange Service (or Deutscher 
                                      Akademischer Austausch Dienst, i.e. DAAD) signed a memorandum of understanding 
                                      with Iran's Science, Research, and Technology ministry. DAAD acts 
                                      with the approval of Germany's Foreign Ministry, so this latest development 
                                      seems to indicate an uneven policy from Berlin vis-a-vis Iran's nuclear 
                                      program.</p>
<p align="justify">- Iranian chief nuclear scientist Fereydoon Abbasi 
                                      admitted to the Arabic daily newspaper <em>Al-Hayat</em> that the 
                                      Iranian government has repeatedly in the past provided false information 
                                      to international agencies such as the IAEA in order to protect its 
                                      nuclear program. Abbasi did not specify the nature of the false information 
                                      nor did he say when it had been presented. Accusing foreign intelligence 
                                      services, such as Britain's MI6 of spying on Iran's nuclear program, 
                                      Abbasi said, "We presented false information sometimes in order 
                                      to protect our nuclear position and our achievements, as there is 
                                      no other choice but to mislead foreign intelligence ... sometimes 
                                      we present a weakness that we do not in fact really have, and sometimes 
                                      we appear to have power without having it.” </p>
<p align="justify">- Despite sanctions aimed at slowing Iranian progress 
                                      to develop nuclear weapons, a report released by the IAEA shows that 
                                      Iran added 1,076 centrifuges to their Fordow enrichment facility, 
                                      which already had 1,064. Additionally, the Islamic Republic has now 
                                      amassed nearly 438 pounds of 20% enriched uranium at both the Fordow 
                                      and Natanz plants.  At the same time, Iran is sharply increasing 
                                      its capability to produce more rapidly the 20% enriched uranium and 
                                      to go even higher to the 90%, weapons-grade level. </p>
<p align="justify">- The United States extended exemptions from sanctions 
                                      on business with Iran to Japan and 10 European countries because they 
                                      have significantly reduced their purchases of petroleum from the Islamic 
                                      Republic. The US originally granted these 11 nations exemptions from 
                                      sanctions in March 2012 as a way of forcing them to reduce their reliance 
                                      on Iranian oil.  The new extensions will enable banks in Belgium, 
                                      Britain, Czech Republic, Frnace, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, 
                                      Poland, Spain and Japan to continue working with Iran without facing 
                                      penalties for at least another 180 days. </p>
<p align="justify">- Despite what the United States and European Union 
                                      call some of the toughest economic sanctions ever imposed, Iran is 
                                      still finding legal ways  to sell or barter oil to its most important 
                                      markets in Asia. To continue selling crude oil to India, Tehran is 
                                      accepting payment in rice, medicine, engineering supplies and steel. 
                                      To sell to China, the Islamic Republic is delivering the oil 
                                      on its own tankers backed by state insurance, not on the commercial 
                                      tankers used in the past. And to deliver to Japan, Iran is having 
                                      the Japanese furnish the multibillion-dollar marine insurance its 
                                      ships need to carry Iranian oil.<br/>

                                      to increase diplomatic pressure on Iran regarding its nuclear weapons 
                                      program. The six world powers agreed on a draft resolution at the 
                                      U.N. nuclear agency that admonishes Iran over its ever-growing uranium 
                                      enrichment program and elucidates their preference for a peaceful 
                                      resolution to the current dispute.</p>
<p align="justify">- The European Union began consideration of a new 
                                      round of sanctions against Iran due to its continued drive towards 
                                      amassing a nuclear weapons capability.  Despite Russian protests 
                                      that sanctions have become "extra-territorial" in nature 
                                      and are harming its own business interests, EU foreign ministers spoke 
                                      of the need to increase pressure on Iran for failing to make progress 
                                      in negotations over it nuclear program.  French Foreign Minister 
                                      Laurent Fabius said, "we consider unacceptable, highly dangerous, 
                                      the prospect of Iran possessing nuclear weapons." "Atomic 
                                      weapons in Iran are not acceptable," added German Foreign Minister

                                        for the purchase of Iranian oil to circumvent the NDAA sanctions.

                                        may not be obvious at the moment, the fact is that they have expressed 
                                        a willingness to negotiate and they continue to seem interested 
                                        in trying to find a diplomatic solution,” he said.  Panetta 
                                        also argued that more pressure eventually would lead Iran to “do 
                                        what’s right.”</p>
<p>- The International Institute for Strategic Studies released a 
                                        report that said sanctions on Iran - specifically those imposed 
                                        by the United States since December 2011 and by the United Nations 
                                        Security Council since Junee 2010 - have stymied efforts by the 
                                        Islamic Republic to develop and produce long-range ballistic missiles 
                                        capable of striking potential targets in western Europe and beyond.  
                                        The report noted that sanctions have not worked to slow uraniun 
                                        enrichment processes or prevented Iran from stockpiling fissile 
                                        material, however, without access to the key propellant ingredients 
                                        and components needed to produce large solid-propellant rocket motors, 
                                        Iran will be halted in its ability to produce the weapons. </p>
<p>- An Israeli legal organization warned British satellite company 
                                        Immarsat that it would pursue legal action against the company if 
                                        it continued to provide guidance systems to Iranian commerical and 
                                        military vehicles.  According to the Shurat HaDin, the Ramat

                                        to Iran despite sanctions on such business imposed by the United 
                                        States and European Union. A letter to Immarsat stated that Shurat 
                                        HaDin wrote told the company to stop providing mobile satellites 
                                        or risk “civil liability from American citizens or others 
                                        who suffer as a result of Iran’s international sponsorship 
                                        of terrorism.”</p>
<p>- The United States imposes additional sanctions on Iran's nuclear 
                                        and ballistic missile proliferation networks, aiming to prevent 
                                        the Islamic Republic from evading the effects of sanctions by targeting 
                                        individuals, companies, and banks that do businesss with Iran.  
                                        The Treasury and State Departments designated 11 entities and 4 
                                        individuals as part of a network of proliferators headed by Iran’s 
                                        Ministry of Defense for Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) and its 
                                        subsidiary, Aerospace Industries Organization (AIO).  The new 
                                        sanctions also publicly exposed numerous front companies, ships 
                                        and banks that work for the government of Iran. </p>
<p>- A list released of German companies conducting bilateral trade 
                                        with Iran, including the selling of "dual-use" products, 
                                        shows that trade continued unabate between the two countries until 
                                        at least the end of calendar year 2011. Merchandize that can be

<p>- South Korea announced that it will halt all oil imports from 
                                        Iran as a result of the EU ban on insuring shipments of Iranian 
                                        crude. South Korea’s government had been in talks with the 
                                        EU to extend exemptions for South Korea, which imported about 9 
                                        percent of its oil from Iran in 2011, however the EU Council said 
                                        exemptions from Iran sanctions will end on July 1 as scheduled. 
                                        In 2011, South Korea imported 87 million barrels of Iranian rude, 
                                        up 20 percent from 2010.</p>
<p>- The European Union agreed that the oil ban against Iran will 
                                        come into force as planned on July 1. Commenting on the move, UK 
                                        Foreign Secretary William Hague said: "Today the EU has agreed 
                                        that the oil ban against Iran will come into force as planned on 
                                        the 1 July. This is an important step and one for which the UK Government 
                                        has argued strongly ... these restrictive measures are the toughest 
                                        ever adopted against the Iranian Government. They reflect the international 
                                        community’s resolve, and our determination, to intensify the 
                                        peaceful pressure on Iran until it starts to build confidence that 
                                        its nuclear programme is purely peaceful."</p>
<p>- Records released in China showed that the Asian country more 
                                        than doubled its imports of Iranian oil during April and May of 
                                        2012, a spike that effectively reverses the belief that China was 
                                        starting to fall in line with Western efforts to sanction Iran. 
                                        Shippers in China, as well, have begun to capitalize on the Western 
                                        sanctions, increasing their business with Iran and guaranteeing 
                                        the Islamic republic's crude export shipments. </p>

<p>- The <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/IAEA.html">IAEA</a> released a <a href="/web/20170102190947/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/arabs/IAEAMay2012.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that confirmed Iran is still moving ahead with its uranium enrichment 
                                        work in defiance of Security Council resolutions and despite Western 
                                        efforts to impose sanctions in order to cut off Iran's nuclear program..  
                                        The IAEA report shows than Iran has significantly increased its 
                                        production of 3.5% low-enriched uranium (has amassed nearly 750kg 
                                        more than what was reported in the previous IAEA report), that it 
                                        continues to stock 19.75% low-enriched uranium, and that its IR-1 
                                        centrifruge performance is increasing. According to independent 
                                        analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security 
                                        (ISIS), the report means that Iran has enough enriched uranium to 
                                        fill five nuclear bombs if refined much further.</p>
<p>- China imported nearly 390,000 barrels of Iranian oil per day, 
                                        a 48% from March 2012, after imports had dropped earlier in the 
                                        year.  China's imports shows that Beijing remains a steady 
                                        customer despite U.S. efforts to tighten sanctions on Tehran.</p>
<p>- The United Kingdom was said to be persuading EU countries to 
                                        delay implementation of sanctions against companies providing insurance 
                                        to tankers carrying oil from Iran. Britain fears that the ban 
                                        on insurance could lead to a dramatic spike in oil prices which 
                                        would significantly damage the already weak European economy.  
                                        The EU ban, meant to take effect July 1, would prevent European 
                                        insurers from covering ships carrying Iranian crude anywhere in 
                                        the world in an effort to stem the influx of money to Iran and thus 
                                        force it to halt it nuclear program. "Britain will be pushing 
                                        the EU to postpone the ban on protection and indemnity insurance 
                                        by six month," said one diplomatic source.</p>
<p>- An Oxfam report and data released by the Stockholm International 
                                        Peace Research Institute showed that Iran has imported over £350 
                                        million worth of weapons over the past three years, despite being 
                                        subject to international sanctions. The country's success in " 
                                        in tapping the international arms market showed the ineffectiveness 
                                        of current restrictions." The UN Security Council, back in 
                                        2007, had requested countries to "exercise restraint" 
                                        in supplying arms to Iran. </p>

<p>- Switzerland decided against sanctioning Iran's central bank or 
                                        imposing an embargo on Iranian oil, failing to follow in the footsteps 
                                        of the EU. The Swiss Economics Committee said that the country would

                                        While Switzerland does not directly import Iranian oil, the Swiss 
                                        position could impact the activities of oil companies based in the

<p>- An intelligence report released by an independent energy policy

                                        to cut out all Iranian oil imports. Over the past two years, 
                                        Greece's oil imports from Iran have spiked to just under 200,000 
                                        barrels per day and Iran's share of Greece's crude imports has more 
                                        than doubled (26% to 53%) as other countries have shied away from 
                                        the economically unstable Greece. The intelligence report also noted 
                                        that Spain and Italy, two other EU member nations, have become increasingly 
                                        dependent on Iranian oil imports.  These three countries consume 
                                        nearly 90% of Iran's total oil exports to the European mainland, 
                                        a factor that could eventually lead to the failure of EU sanctions.</p>

                                        shippers and maritime security agencies do not know they are moving 
                                        Iranian vessels. Additionally, SIPRI noted that Iranian weapons 
                                        smugglers are using respectable shipping companies out of Europe 
                                        to move illegal weapons into Iran; though this was mostly done without

<p>- India, the world's fourth-largest oil consumer, said it would 
                                        not take steps to cut oil and petroleum imports from Iran despite 
                                        the US and European sanctions. "It is not possible for India 
                                        to take any decision to reduce the imports from Iran drastically, 
                                        because among the countries which can provide the requirement of 
                                        the emerging economies, Iran is an important country amongst them,"

                                        into Iran increased by 360%. Iran’s Deputy Minister of Commerce,
