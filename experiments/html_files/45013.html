<h1 class="ChapterTitle">CHAPTER _______</h1>
<h2 class="Title">An act to amend, repeal, and add Sections 1653.5, 12800, 12801, and 12801.5 of, and to add Sections 12801.9, 12801.10, and 12801.11 to, the Vehicle Code, relating to driver’s licenses. </h2>
<h2 class="LegCounselDigest">LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL’S DIGEST</h2>
<p class="FirstDigestPara">AB 60, 
            					Alejo. Driver’s licenses: eligibility: required documentation.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100C1">(1) Existing law requires the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to require an applicant for an original driver’s license or identification card to submit satisfactory proof that the applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law. Existing law prohibits the department from issuing an original driver’s license or identification card to a person who does not submit satisfactory proof that his or her presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100C6">This bill would require the department to issue an original driver’s license to a person who is unable to submit satisfactory proof that the
		applicant’s presence in the United States is authorized under federal law if he or she meets all other qualifications for licensure and provides satisfactory proof to the department of his or her identity and California residency. The bill would require the department to adopt emergency regulations, in consultation with appropriate interested parties, as prescribed, to implement those provisions, including identifying documents acceptable for the purposes of providing identity and California residency and procedures for verifying the authenticity of the documents. The bill would
		require the department to accept various types of documentation for this purpose. The bill would require a license issued pursuant to those provisions, including temporary licenses, to include on the front of the card a recognizable feature and a specified notice. The bill would authorize the department to modify these licenses if these licenses do not meet federal requirements. The bill would provide that information collected pursuant to those provisions is not a public record
		and shall not be disclosed by the department, except as required by law.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100C8">This bill would make it a violation of law to discriminate against an individual because he or she holds or presents a license issued under these provisions. The bill would require, on or before January 1, 2018, the
		California Research Bureau to compile and submit to the Legislature and the Governor a report that, among other things, includes instances when these licenses are used to discriminate against an individual. The bill would provide that a person applying for a license pursuant to these provisions may be required to pay, only until June 30, 2017, an additional fee to offset the reasonable administrative costs of implementing these provisions. The bill would make other technical and conforming changes.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100CA">(2) Existing law requires the department to require an application for a driver’s license to contain the applicant’s social security number and any other number or identifier determined to be appropriate by the department. Existing law authorizes an applicant who provides satisfactory proof that his or her presence in the United States is authorized under federal law, but who is not eligible for a social security
		number, to receive an original driver’s license if he or she meets all other requirements for licensure.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100CF">This bill would authorize an applicant who is unable to provide satisfactory proof that his or her presence in the United States is authorized under federal law to sign an affidavit attesting that he or she is both ineligible for a social security number and unable to submit satisfactory proof that his or her presence in the United States is authorized under federal law in lieu of submitting a social security number. The bill would prohibit the use of this information to consider an individual’s citizenship or immigration status as a basis for a criminal investigation, arrest, or detention.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100D1">This bill would
		make these changes operative on January 1, 2015, or on the date the director of the department executes a specified declaration, whichever is sooner. The bill would make these provisions inoperative on the effective date of a final judicial determination made by any court of appellate jurisdiction that any of these provisions, or their application, are enjoined, found unconstitutional, or held invalid for any reason. The bill would require the department to post this information on its Internet Web site.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100D3">This bill would state that its provisions do not authorize an individual to apply for, or be issued, a commercial driver’s license without submitting his or her social security account number with his or her application.</p>
<p class="DigestKey"></p>
<p class="Preamble">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>
<div class="Body">
<div id="BS-SECTION_1.">
<div class="camlContent">
<h3 class="SecNum">SECTION 1.  </h3>
<p id="PARA-N100E8">The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>
<p id="PARA-N100EA">(a) According to a report by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, car crashes rank among the leading causes of death in the United States.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100EF">(b) Previous studies done by the foundation have found that approximately one in five fatal crashes in the United States involve an unlicensed or invalidly licensed driver.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100F4">(c) The California Department of Motor Vehicles, Licensing Operations Division, Research and Development Branch has stated that unlicensed driving is a major California safety problem.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100F9">(d) In a report titled, “Estimating the Exposure and Fatal Crash Rates of Suspended/Revoked and Unlicensed Drivers in California” published in Accident Analysis and Prevention, 29(1), the Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 12 percent of the drivers on the road do not have valid driver’s licenses.</p>
<p id="PARA-N100FE">(e) In the State of California, there are potentially 1.4 million drivers who are unlicensed and uninsured.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10103">(f) It is our responsibility to ensure that all California drivers are properly trained, tested, and insured in order to make our roads safer.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10108">(g) In order to meet the operative date established in this act, it is necessary for the California Department of Motor Vehicles to promulgate regulations pursuant to the emergency rulemaking process.</p>
<p id="PARA-N1010D">(h) The California Department of Motor Vehicles currently issues approximately 900,000 original driver’s licenses annually, and estimates there will be an additional 1.4 million original driver’s license applicants over a three year period under the provisions of this act.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10112">(i) To provide services to this added volume of original driver license applicants, the California Department of Motor Vehicles must undertake significant and costly activities, including, among others, the hiring of additional temporary staff, the training of existing and additional temporary staff, and obtaining and preparing new temporary facilities to process the applications.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10117">(j) The California Department Motor Vehicles must promulgate regulations to determine the appropriate documentation necessary to prove identity and California residency under the provisions of this act, and procedures for
		  verifying the authenticity of the documentation.</p>
<p id="PARA-N1011C">(k) The California Department of Motor Vehicles must also modify driver licenses issued under this act to satisfy the requirements of Section 37.71 of Title 6 of the Code of Federal Regulations, adopted pursuant to paragraph (11) of subdivision (d) of Section 202 of the Real ID Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-13).</p>
<p id="PARA-N10121">(<i>l</i>) Therefore, the California Department of Motor Vehicles may assess an additional fee to applicants applying under the provisions of this act in an amount sufficient to offset the reasonable costs of implementing the provisions of the act. If this additional fee is assessed, it shall be assessed only until June 30, 2017.</p>

<h3 class="SecNum">SEC. 2.  </h3>
<p id="PARA-N1012D">The Legislature further finds and declares all of the following:</p>
<p id="PARA-N1012F">(a) The holder of a driver’s license issued pursuant to Section 12801.9 shall not by reason of that driver’s license be treated in a discriminatory manner pursuant to the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Section 51 of the Civil Code) or any other law.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10134">(b) A driver’s license issued pursuant to Section 12801.9 shall not be used as evidence of the holder’s citizenship or immigration status, and shall not be used as a basis for a
		  criminal investigation, arrest, or detention in circumstances where a person with a driver license that was not issued under Section 12801.9 would not be criminally investigated, arrested, or detained.</p>
<p id="PARA-N10139">(c) The State of California is in the process of demonstrating its compliance with the requirements of the REAL ID Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-13).</p>
