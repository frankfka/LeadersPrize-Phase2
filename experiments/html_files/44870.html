      <p></p>
<p>Section 201. (a) There is hereby created an account in the Treasury of 
        the United States to be known as the Old-Age Reserve Account hereinafter 
        in this title called the Account. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated 
        to the Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending 
        June 30, 1937, an amount sufficient as an annual premium to provide for 
        the payments required under this title, such amount to be determined on 
        a reserve basis in accordance with accepted actuarial principles, and 
        based upon such tables of mortality as the Secretary of the Treasury shall 
        from time to time adopt, and upon an interest rate of 3 per centum per 
        annum compounded annually. The Secretary of the Treasury shall submit 
        annually to the Bureau of the Budget an estimate of the appropriations 
        to be made to the Account.<br/>
        (b) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such 
        portion of the amounts credited to the Account as is not, in his judgment, 
        required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only 
        in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations 
        guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For 
        such purpose such obligations may be acquired <br/>
        (1) on original issue at par, or <br/>
        (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes 
        for which obligations of the United States may be issued under the Second 
        Liberty Bond Act, as amended, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance 
        at par of special obligations exclusively to the Account. Such special 
        obligations shall bear interest at the rate of 3 per centum per annum. 
        Obligations other than such special obligations may be acquired for the 
        Account only on such terms as to provide an investment yield of not less 
        than 3 per centum per annum. <br/>
        (c) Any obligations acquired by the Account (except special obligations 
        issued exclusively to the Account) may be sold at the market price, and 
        such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest. 
        <br/>
        (d) The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, 
        any obligations held in the Account shall be credited to and form a part 
        of the Account.<br/>
        (e) All amounts credited to the Account shall be available for making 
        payments required under this title.<br/>
        (f) The Secretary of the Treasury shall include in his annual report the 
        actuarial status of the Account.</p>
<p><a name="Old-Benefit"></a>OLD-AGE BENEFIT PAYMENTS</p>
<p>SEC. 202. (a) Every qualified individual (as defined in section 210) 
        shall be entitled to receive, with respect to the period beginning on 
        the date he attains the age of sixty-five, or on January 1, 1942, whichever 
        is the later, and ending on the date of his death, an old-age benefit 
        (payable as nearly as practicable in equal monthly installments) as follows: 
        <br/>
        (1) If the total wages (as defined in section 210) determined by the Board 
        to have been paid to him, with respect to employment (as defined in section 
        210) after December 31, 1936, and before he attained the age of sixty- 
        five, were not more than $3,000, the old-age benefit shall be at a monthly 
        rate of one-half of 1 per centum of such total wages; <br/>
        (2) If such total wages were more than $3,000, the old-age benefit shall 
        be at a monthly rate equal to the sum of the following: <br/>
        (A) One-half of 1 per centum of $3,000; plus <br/>
        (B) One-twelfth of 1 per centum of the amount by which such total wages 
        exceeded $3,000 and did not exceed $45,000; plus <br/>
        (C) One-twenty-fourth of 1 per centum of the amount by which such total 
        wages exceeded $45,000. <br/>
        (b) In no case shall the monthly rate computed under subsection (a) exceed 
        $85.<br/>
        (c) If the Board finds at any time that more or less than the correct 
        amount has theretofore been paid to any individual under this section, 
        then, under regulations made by the Board, proper adjustments shall be 
        made in connection with subsequent payments under this section to the 
        same individual.<br/>
        (d) Whenever the Board finds that any qualified individual has received 
        wages with respect to regular employment after he attained the age of 
        sixty-five, the old-age benefit payable to such individual shall be reduced, 
        for each calendar month in any part of which such regular employment occurred, 
        by an amount equal to one month's benefit. Such reduction shall be made, 
        under regulations prescribed by the Board, by deductions from one or more 
        payments of old-age benefit to such individual.</p>
<p><a name="Payments"></a>PAYMENTS UPON DEATH</p>
<p>SEC. 203. (a) If any individual dies before attaining the age of sixty-five, 
        there shall be paid to his estate an amount equal to 3 1/2 per centum 
        of the total wages determined by the Board to have been paid to him, with 
        respect to employment after December 31, 1936. <br/>
        (b) If the Board finds that the correct amount of the old-age benefit 
        payable to a qualified individual during his life under section 202 was 
        less than 3 1/2 per centum of the total wages by which such old-age benefit 
        was measurable, then there shall be paid to his estate a sum equal to 
        the amount, if any, by which such 3 1/2 per centum exceeds the amount 
        (whether more or less than the correct amount) paid to him during his 
        life as old-age benefit. <br/>
        (c) If the Board finds that the total amount paid to a qualified individual 
        under an old-age benefit during his life was less than the correct amount 
        to which he was entitled under section 202, and that the correct amount 
        of such old-age benefit was 3 1/2 per centum or more of the total wages 
        by which such old-age benefit was measurable, then there shall be paid 
        to his estate a sum equal to the amount, if any, by which the correct 
        amount of the old- age benefit exceeds the amount which was so paid to 
        him during his life.</p>
<p><a name="Aged"></a>PAYMENTS TO AGED INDIVIDUALS NOT QUALIFIED FOR BENEFITS</p>
<p>SEC. 204. (a) There shall be paid in a lump sum to any individual who, 
        upon attaining the age of sixty-five, is not a qualified individual, an 
        amount equal to 3 1/2 per centum of the total wages determined by the
