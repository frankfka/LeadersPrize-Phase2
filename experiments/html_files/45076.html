She can’t sleep, always alert to any sounds; even the sound of a door closing terrifies her. If a door slams, she thinks it’s an attack on us or an airstrike. She is losing weight. If anyone wants to go outside, if I have to go get groceries, she says: “I don’t want to lose you, father. I don’t want you to die.”</p>
<p>They have been out of school since March 26. When the airstrikes started, everything kind of stopped here. None of the residents of Sana can go to school.</p>
<p>My pregnant wife is in a bad condition, especially, because she is diabetic and at risk that we could run out of insulin at anytime. She can’t receive proper medical care.</p>
<p>My children wish that they could go back to school; my pregnant wife dreams of a peaceful night to sleep without one of our children screaming in their sleep every time there is an airstrike. I pray every day that when I go to the markets I can still find food for my family; this is decreasing on a daily basis.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="3525"><strong>Arwa Naaman Saiid, 23, is a teacher and information technology student.

Their fear and continued crying forced us to leave our house. We paid $50 per person to leave Sana. I sold my jewelry just to escape.</p>
<p>We have been affected materially, morally and psychologically because of airstrikes and earthshaking explosions that prevent us from sleeping.</p>
<p>We are six members in the same house, including my sick mother who broke her back more than two months ago. We couldn’t afford paying her treatment expenses. Now she’s home and can’t move. We have no food, no potable water, no electricity. We are denied the most basic rights.</p>
<p>We need to put an end to this flagrant aggression. We need the blockade to be lifted. Leave us alone! We are not associated with any political party. We are just Yemeni citizens. We need to be able to sleep, to eat and to drink what God bestowed upon us, without blockade and without killings.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="232" data-total-count="4730"><strong>Maali Jamil, 25, moved to Michigan as a young child before returning to Yemen as a teenager.

<p>With the problems and everything, nobody is working. Everybody is at home. Who is going to pay for classes? It’s not important right now. People need to eat.</p>
<p>My father has heart disease and is very ill. Every few days, he needs to run some blood work so the doctor can adjust his dose. When there is no fuel, he cannot go. If there is fuel, but no power, the labs don’t operate. When he doesn’t get the blood work done, the doctor can’t adjust the dose, so my mom is usually at a loss and ends up guessing what he needs.</p>
<p>We tried to leave and were stranded at the Yemeni-Saudi border near Haradh twice, once for five days and once for two days.</p>
<p>The Yemeni people are barely breathing. My family and I are doing really well compared with most Yemenis.</p>
<p>My mom is from Aden, and the horror stories we hear are heartbreaking. One of my mother’s cousins says all they have to eat is cookies. Her children keep asking her when are they are going to have real food, and she just broke down and cried.</p></blockquote><figure aria-label="media" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000003756200" data-media-action="modal" id="media-100000003756200" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/23/world/23yemensocial4/23yemensocial4-master675.jpg" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" role="group">

He lost thousands of dollars in plane tickets after a tourist group canceled an April trip. After the area near his home was bombed, he moved in with his extended family in another area of Sana.</strong></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="710" data-total-count="11062"><p>Even if the war ends soon, and if tourists come back, I don’t know if we can refund this large sum. So my business is defunct. One brother works in the airport — he’s lost his job. Another brother works in an area constantly bombed by the Saudis — Faj Attan — and he now has lost his job. So while my family is alive and well, thank God, we, like most people, are struggling and out of work.</p>
<p>Imagine if this continues and we’ll have an entirely uneducated generation. Plus when the planes fly overhead, or children hear the airstrikes, they cry, and they can’t sleep at night. Now, if a father wants his kids to do something, he says, “Go or I’ll call the planes,” and they move right away.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="11332"><strong>Assaad Lutf Albarty and his family, who live in Sana, have been affected by the shortages of food, fuel and medicine. His father has not been able to secure his blood pressure medication or get the treatment he needs. He is hoping to travel to Jordan for heart surgery. </strong></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="641" data-total-count="11973"><p>Many times we live without electricity for days or weeks. There is a lack of gasoline, which is used for transportation, and diesel, which is used to transport goods and operate factories. We have returned to the Stone Ages by using firewood and charcoal to cook at home. I’m not exaggerating — we’re doing this on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We can’t get water without electricity or diesel, and we can’t get the basic things such as flour and wheat, because of the inability to distribute them to consumers and our inability to go to distribution centers. Also because of the blockade, no merchants can import any new food, fuel or medicines.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="12129"><strong>Bakil Muttee Ghundol had been taking a course in teaching English in Aden, but he moved to Ibb, where his family lives, shortly before the airstrikes began.</strong></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="527" data-total-count="12656"><p>Hundreds of displaced families from different cities come to Ibb because it’s considered a safe place as there are no airstrikes as there are in Aden, Sana or Taiz. But all the people here in Ibb are suffering as there is a huge lack of fuel, water and food. In addition, the electricity has been cut off for months. Only rich people have generators. Sometimes we go to their homes to charge our phones, our laptops.</p>
<p>My family is all safe, but some neighbors were killed in an airstrike. One was a close friend of my brother.</p></blockquote><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="152" data-total-count="12808"><strong>Hanan Ahmed al-Mansor, 23, </strong><strong>attends Jinan University in China. Her immediate family is still in Sana, but her extended family managed to escape to Egypt.</strong></p><blockquote class="story-quote story-content" data-para-count="1398" data-total-count="14206"><p>Far from everything, I am still affected as badly as my family. I’ve had sleepless nights, nightmares, continuous anxiety and multiple visits to the doctor. My academic level has dropped, and every day, I am either crying or senseless.</p>
<p>My mother is my superhero. She has worked her way through a couple of failed businesses, but she finally was able to stand on her own two feet in her mid-50s and created a successful restaurant in Yemen. This restaurant was recently completely damaged after an airstrike hit a building in front of it. Our dream and our only way to eat and live with dignity was shattered. All I can think of now is, how am I going to finish university?</p>
<p>The children in my family sleep covering their ears. They only speak of how much they fear death, and one of them told his mom: “I want to die before you. I don’t want to see you die.” And, “In heaven, can I ask for a TV to watch you because I’m going to miss you?”</p>
<p>My cousin told me this about her kids. She was writing and crying at the same time. It’s very hard for me to keep in touch with my family since they usually only open the generator for emergencies, like to pump the water to the pipes. However, I buy calling cards to call them in emergencies, and if they have battery left, they respond.</p>
<p>I need to sleep knowing that I’ll wake up and my family is safe. I need Saudi Arabia to leave Yemen alone.</p></blockquote><footer class="story-footer story-content">
