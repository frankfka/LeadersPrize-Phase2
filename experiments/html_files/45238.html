Arizona, that attracted several thousand people. He shared the stage with the father of a man who was killed by an undocumented immigrant—and Trump continued his rant against illegal immigration that began when he launched his campaign and started to surge in the <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/https://www.yahoo.com/politics/trump-surges-in-early-national-polls-but-so-did-124178248811.html" target="_blank">polls</a>. Not every Republican in Arizona was pleased with Trump’s visit. Senator John McCain, the Party’s Presidential nominee in 2008, reacted to the event with dismay.</p><p>“It’s very bad,” McCain, who was eager to talk about Trump, told me on Monday when I stopped by his Senate office. The Senator is up for reëlection in 2016, and he pays close attention to how the issue of immigration is playing in his state. He was particularly rankled by Trump’s rally. “This performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,” McCain said. “Because what he did was he fired up the crazies.”</p><p>McCain, who has long supported comprehensive immigration reform and was a member of the so-called <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-gang-of-eights-immigration-fight">Gang of Eight</a> that <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/getting-to-maybe">successfully pushed immigration legislation</a> through the Senate in 2013, has been at war with the far right in Arizona for years. “We have a very extreme element within our Republican Party,” McCain said. He then noted that he was personally censured by Arizona Republicans in January of 2014 and has been fighting to push out the extremists in the state G.O.P. ever since. “We did to some degree regain control of the Party.”</p><p>But McCain fears that Trump may be reversing those gains. “Now he galvanized them,” McCain said. “He’s really got them activated.”</p><p>McCain probably has more <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.ontheissues.org/celeb/John_McCain_Immigration.htm" target="_blank">experience</a> navigating the issue of immigration than any other national Republican politician. He has fought off right-wing challengers in Arizona primaries and run twice in G.O.P. Presidential primaries. He has occasionally reined in his enthusiasm for an immigration-reform plan that would include a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants—he hedged a bit <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/17/return-of-the-nativist">during the 2008 campaign</a>—but he has never abandoned the policy.</p><p>Many Republicans assume that Trump’s current position at the top of national polls won’t last, and McCain, who said that he last met Trump many years ago, pointed out that conservatives are starting to learn more about Trump’s liberal past. “He was a big Democratic supporter,” he said. “Some of this stuff is going to come out: he gave more money to Democrats than Republicans; he had Hillary Clinton at his wedding. You know, he’s attacking Hillary Clinton after she was in the front row of his—I don’t know which wedding it was.” (Trump has been married three* times.)</p><p>But McCain worried that Trump might have more staying power than many political analysts assume. And, even if he slips in the polls, Trump’s attacks on immigrants and his focus on the porous border will have a warping effect for Republicans.</p><p>“We’ll see how this plays out, but there is some anger in my state,” McCain said. He mentioned the continuing challenges of border security that were vividly highlighted when <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2014/07/02-unaccompanied-children-central-america-negroponte" target="_blank">tens of thousands of Central American minors</a> crossed into America last summer. “People who otherwise might be more centrist are angry about this border situation.”</p><p>McCain is an ardent backer of his good friend <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191118204800/http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/what-lindsey-graham-wants">Senator Lindsey Graham</a>, who is languishing in the G.O.P.

He noted that Graham has been one of the few Republicans to condemn Trump in strong terms. On Sunday, Graham said on CNN, “I think [Trump]’s a wrecking ball for the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic community, and we need to push back.” He added that Republicans “need to reject this demagoguery. If we don’t, we will lose, and we will deserve to lose.”</p><p>McCain, who is eighteen years older than Graham, sounded like a proud father. “Lindsey said this is a moral test for our party.

McCain licked his finger, held it up in the air, and laughed.</p><p>“You know that old song from before you were born?” McCain said, speaking of the Bob Dylan classic “Subterranean Homesick Blues.” “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.”</p><p><em class="">* An earlier version of this piece said that Trump had been married four

been getting a lot of glowing press these days. As if to propose the never-before-in-history uniqueness of our current moment, we rush to remind ourselves of the lovelier sides of Tricky Dick: his constructive cunning in foreign affairs, particularly the opening to China; his sporadic moments of progressivism, including the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency; and, finally, his scowling acknowledgement of the inevitable in August, 1974, when he received the leaders of the Republican Party and accepted their counsel that support for him had vanished in the Senate and the public at large. John Oliver’s way of paying wiseass tribute to the sepia past is to cast our twenty-first-century travails as “Stupid Watergate”—a scandal that is at least as horrific as the bell-bottomed original, but one in which “everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.”\n\nThis not only ignores the countless miseries in Nixon’s policy record, from Vietnam to domestic spying, it also vastly underrates the darkness of Watergate itself. “Watergate” is an umbrella term, and yet it had at its center a conspiracy in which Nixon and his confederates plotted to destroy at least one of his strongest-seeming rivals in the 1972 election campaign. Republican operatives set out to destroy Edmund Muskie, of Maine, in order to face a far weaker opponent, George McGovern, of South Dakota. (Nixon, of course, got his wish, and won a forty-nine-state landslide over McGovern.)\n\n“Watergate” also stands for the fullness of Nixon’s deceptions, his resentments, and his plots, some abandoned, others fulfilled. To get the full, rancid flavor of Nixon’s conspiratorial frame of mind, it’s necessary to spend many hours with the White House tapes, which were finally forced into the public domain by the Supreme Court. One random morsel, but a typical one: in June, 1971, the New York *Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers, an immense classified study of the Vietnam War, its origins and its ugliest truths. The whistle-blower of that era was Daniel Ellsberg, a defense analyst at the *RAND*{:.small} Corporation who leaked the documents to Neil Sheehan, of the *Times.* We know from the tapes that Nixon’s reaction to their publication hardly does credit to any notion of Presidential probity or restraint. At a meeting in the Executive Office Building late in the day on July 2, 1971, with his aides H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, the President suggested the revival of the old House Committee on Un-American Activities. “You know what’s going to charge up an audience,” Nixon said. “Jesus Christ, they’ll be hanging from the rafters. Going after all these Jews. Just find one that is a Jew, will you.”\n\nThat same summer, in a similarly paranoid spirit, Nixon suspected that someone at the Brookings Institution was in possession of documents describing how he may have illegally interfered in peace talks with the North Vietnamese before he ascended to the White House. Nixon told Haldeman and Henry Kissinger, his national-security adviser, “Goddammit, get in and get those files. Blow the safe and get it.” The following day, he returned to the theme: “Get it done! I want it done! I want the Brookings safe cleaned out!” G. Gordon Liddy, a particularly aggressive operative in the Watergate drama, even drew up plans to firebomb Brookings. The building still stands.\n\nThere are volumes of such moments. And yet Donald Trump brings us to a different level of crazy. The President’s klieg-light brazenness, his utter lack of shame, is on daily, public display. What Nixon muttered in the Oval Office, Trump bellows to reporters on the White House lawn. As Carl Bernstein, who, with Bob Woodward, broke the crucial stories in the Watergate scandal for the Washington *Post,* told me, “When Nixon talked about his crimes, he talked about them in *private*. He conspired in *private.* Trump is out front and center about his crimes, his corruption.” The [text messages](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/04/us/politics/ukraine-text-messages-volker.html) between and among diplomats that were released on Thursday are merely confirmation that  Trump’s diplomats, aides, and operatives were furtively, and anxiously, discussing what their master makes no effort to conceal.\n\nWe know from Bernstein and Woodward’s book “[The Final Days](https://www.amazon.com/Final-Days-Bob-Woodward/dp/0743274067),” and subsequent corroborating accounts, that Nixon spent his last weeks in office as an erratic mess, drinking heavily, roaming the White House late at night, talking to the portraits of Presidents past. Bad Shakespeare. Trump does not drink; he is as comfortable in the television lights as Nixon was not. He may be worse than he once was, more unhinged, more furious, more undisciplined, but he is not essentially different.\n\n“Nixon, even on the tapes when he is talking conspiratorially and criminally, held himself together emotionally until the very end,” Bernstein said. “His emotional collapse came only in the final weeks, when he knew how cornered he was. It was only then that he started talking to the pictures on the walls. This loss of control is ongoing with Trump. It’s not about the final days. And his corruption is totally as we see it, out front. He doesn’t try to hide it. He doesn’t try to hide the conflicts of interest or the lying. He is not a secretive conspirator.”\n\nDonald Trump’s behavior echoes Nixon’s in one sense: he and his confederates appear to have been engaged in an effort to undermine the integrity of a Presidential election. From all the evidence and reporting now available––and there will be more––it is increasingly clear that Trump set out to destroy his potential Democratic rival Joe Biden by getting the leaders of foreign nations to investigate the Biden family: an unmistakable misuse of power. All this while he is engaged in crucial foreign-policy matters ranging from the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a trade war with China.\n\nTrump’s shamelessness leaves Nixon far behind. There is every indication that Trump cares only about his personal fate, and little about the diplomatic or economic consequences to the country. But can this really be news? How many officials who left Trump’s inner circle have waved their hands to tell us that he is not merely a man of limited intelligence and discipline but a very real danger to the national security of the country? [James Mattis](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/james-mattis-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-the-president). [H. R. McMaster](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/30/mcmaster-and-commander). [Gary Cohn](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/gary-cohns-losing-trade-working-for-donald-trump). [John Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/john-kelly-the-white-house-chief-of-staff-is-finally-leaving-crazytown). [Rex Tillerson](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rex-tillerson-gets-fired-the-day-after-he-criticized-russia). History will judge their calculations and actions, but is there any mistaking their judgment of the man they served?\n\nWhere Watergate and “Stupid Watergate” might diverge most radically is in the potential endgame. We soothingly remind ourselves that, after many months of reporting revelations, court decisions, and hearings in the House and the Senate, Nixon bent to reality and left the capital in Marine One. What makes anyone imagine that Trump will do the same before he has exacted maximal damage? And what institution will force his hand? The Republican Party?\n\nThe G.O.P. is radically more conservative now than it was during the Watergate era. When the House Judiciary Committee voted on three articles of impeachment against Nixon, all twenty-one Democrats voted yes on two or more articles, and seven of the seventeen Republicans voted for at least one. At this point in the Trump drama, at least, it is hard to imagine congressional Republicans doing the same.\n\nTrump also knows that he lives in an immensely different public-opinion universe than Nixon. In the seventies, there was no Fox News, no Breitbart, no social media, no bots, no trolls. Nixon certainly hated the mainstream media––the three networks, the *Times,* the *Post,* and so on––but there was no alternative. In 1970, while he was working as a media consultant for Nixon, Roger Ailes started thinking about ways to circumvent what he saw as the liberal hegemony, particularly in television. And, of course, [he invented Fox News](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house). And yet Trump is in such a state now that his new talking point is that Fox News is not sufficiently accurate (read: sufficiently obsequious). He is talking about starting a network of his own.\n\n“Look, nothing is going gently into the night at the end of this drama, no matter who wins,” Bernstein told me. “Nixon was a reflection of Nixon. Watergate was not about the country. It was, above all, about Nixon. The Trump story is all tied up with the country itself. I felt even before this started that we are in a cold civil war. And Trump has brought the cold civil war to the point of near ignition. It’s much worse and deeper than just polarization. It’s not just political, it’s cultural. These are different times than the Watergate era. We’re a different people than we were in 1972 to 1974\\. And the Republican Party is a different party.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1cc12710c62d10815492","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Richard Nixon","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"richard-nixon"},{"id":"5c2e1ca52396212cbb9fc9d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Watergate","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"watergate"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bc86f2c9a24498f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republican Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republican-party"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02f72179605b11ad9967","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Remnick has been editor of *The New Yorker* since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

In one, President [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) is guilty of abusing power in many ways and on many occasions, and one such occasion is being [dissected and laid out in great detail](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/crazy-for-trump-on-the-gop-plan-to-keep-impeachment-partisan) on national television. In the other America and the other set of hearings, Democrats are out to get Trump at any cost, have latched onto a muddled and inconsequential incident, and are laying it out in great detail on national television in the hopes of convincing the public that the President has done something wrong. These two realities do not overlap.\n\nThe first reality is summed up in the [opening statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6548458-Schiff.html) by Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said, “The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s [Ukraine’s] vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections. Whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist with two political investigations that would help his reëlection campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the Presidency.”\n\nThe second reality is presented in an [eighteen-page memo](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/politics/read-republican-memo-trump-defense-impeachment-inquiry/index.html) prepared for House Republicans in advance of the hearings. Viewed from the vantage point of the first reality, the defense that this memo seems to propose is full of holes, as my colleague John Cassidy has [written](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-house-republicans-trump-impeachment-defense-is-full-of-holes). But for the second reality the memo paints a coherent picture. It says that the Ukraine story is confusing. It notes that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that Trump was wary of shouldering the burden of supporting it, and that there is no direct evidence that aid was held up pending the investigation—after all, in the end, the aid was released. According to the memo, Democrats have made a mountain out of the Ukraine molehill in order to get to Trump. In their zeal, they have been blind to Ukraine’s corruption and probable attempts to meddle in the U.S. election; they care only about Russian meddling, and only because they are out to undermine Trump.\n\nIn Reality One, the testimony of William B. Taylor, Jr., the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, contained a bombshell: information that the day after the infamous phone conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, a member of Taylor’s staff overheard a phone call between Trump and his Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in which Trump demanded dirt from Ukraine on the Bidens. In Reality One, every detail matters, and together the details line up to create a chronology of “regular” foreign policy, as [Taylor put it](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/22/us/politics/william-taylor-ukraine-testimony.html), doing protracted losing battle against “highly irregular” foreign policy. But in Reality Two Taylor’s testimony is itself further proof of the conspiracy against Trump.\n\nEach reality is impenetrable to the other. If you hold to Reality One, no amount of evidence that the Democrats are out to get Trump will change your mind—on the contrary, you believe that the Democrats should use anything they can get their hands on to try to expose the President’s malfeasance and get him removed from office. If you hold to Reality Two, all the evidence summoned by the Democrats will make you only more convinced that they are out to get the President, and the more evidence there is, the more obscure the Ukraine story will seem. The gap between these realities makes it difficult even to analyze the impeachment proceedings. In the framework of Reality One, Republicans appear to be mounting silly and shaky defenses or throwing up smoke screens by demanding an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden. But Republicans are not actually defending the President against accusations of abuse of power; instead, they are mounting an offense against the Democrats, whose very enterprise they consider illegitimate.\n\nOf course, these realities do not have equal validity—although, unlike other Trump-era conflicts, this argument is not primarily one between facts and lies. This is an argument about what political power means. In Reality One, political power is governed by values, norms, history, procedure, and law. In Reality Two, political power aims to be absolute—its limit is what the President can get away with. Neither side is explicitly stating its position in this argument. Schiff came close when he said, at the beginning of his opening statement, that the outcome of the hearings will “affect not only the future of this Presidency but the future of the Presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their Commander-in-Chief.” But then he turned to laying out the Ukraine case. The side of Reality One is acting as though this were a legal prosecution. The side of Reality Two is denying the prosecution’s legitimacy. The differences between these realities are less factual than they are moral and political (in the deep, rather than partisan, sense of the word “politics”).\n\nThe realities are not equivalent, but they are in a sort of equilibrium. An equilibrium always favors the status quo. To upset the equilibrium, the Democrats would have to devise a strategy that would penetrate the Republicans’ reality bubble. That is likely impossible. But, if it's possible at all, it probably requires an approach that is less like a narrow prosecution and more like an attack on all fronts: on the President’s self-dealing; the profits he has extracted, using the office of the Presidency, from his hotels and resorts; the profits and roles in the Administration of the President’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner; the family’s relationship with Saudi Arabia; the malfeasance of issuing and revoking security clearances; the accusations of sexual assault; the cheating of charities; the still-unseen tax returns; and much, much more. No matter the approach, the outcome appears predictable: the House indicts and the Senate acquits. But at least the impeachment hearings ought to lay down a record of abuses that will make future historians blush, rather than a protocol of the time that the Democrats tried to get Trump on the one obscure smoking gun they had—and failed.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca42396212cbb9fc9d1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"House of Representatives","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"house-of-representatives"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

Yovanovitch said that she had been “kneecapped” and “smeared” by the government that she was serving. She described her dismay and fear after she learned that Trump had told the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a phone call that she was going to “go through some things.”\n\n“I was shocked and devastated that I would feature in a phone call between two heads of state in such a manner where President Trump said that I was bad news to another world leader, and that I would be going through some things,” she said. “It was a terrible moment.”\n\nYovanovitch—who spent more than three decades in the U.S. Foreign Service, with assignments in Somalia, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Moscow—described an extraordinary series of events. While she was enforcing the U.S. government’s stated policy of countering corruption in Ukraine, she was undermined by President Trump’s personal lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani). According to Yovanovitch, Giuliani worked with corrupt Ukrainians who were angered by Yovanovitch’s crackdown to force her out of her position. “What continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them,” she testified. “And working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of a U.S. Ambassador.”\n\nYovanovitch gave voice to the diplomats whom Trump and his Republican supporters have denigrated, presenting Americans with a choice of whom to believe. “Let me be clear on who we are and how we serve this country,” she said. “We are professionals. We are public servants who, by vocation and training, pursue the policies of the President, regardless of who holds that office.” She went on, “We take our oath seriously—the same oath that each one of you takes, to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and allegiance to same.”\n\nDuring questioning from Democrats, Yovanovitch described how she sought support from Pompeo but received none, and recalled her astonishment when she learned that President Trump had threatened her during his call with Zelensky. “A person who saw me actually reading the transcript said that the color drained from my face,” Yovanovitch said. “I think I even had a physical reaction.” \n\nIn an extraordinary step, Trump attacked Yovanovitch during her testimony. “Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?” he wrote on Twitter. “Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.” \n\n[Adam Schiff](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trump-impeachment-hearing-adam-schiff-emphasizes-the-constitutional-stakes), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, read the tweets aloud to Yovanovitch. “What effect do you think that has on other witnesses’ willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?” he asked. Yovanovitch replied, “I can’t speak to what the President is trying to do, but I think the effect is to be intimidating.” Schiff later said that Trump was intimidating a witness—potential grounds for impeachment.\n\nYovanovitch will be attacked by Republicans. Her account will be questioned and undermined. Conspiracy theories will be trafficked about her. Those efforts will likely only bolster her account of being smeared, bullied, and intimidated by a President whom she has never met. On Friday morning, Yovanovitch’s testimony and Trump’s tweets captured how he conducts himself as President and how he treats those who work for him. The lesson of her story was a simple one: any public servant who gets in the crosshairs of this President will be destroyed by him. Yovanovitch’s testimony alone may not lead to the President’s removal, but she did great damage to Donald Trump.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020

He did not like what he saw. As his definitive biographer, Ron Chernow, makes clear, Hamilton was an advocate of strong executive power, yet he also envisaged the rise of a demagogue who would put liberty and the rule of law at risk, and place his own interests before those of the country. Writing to George Washington, in 1792, Hamilton seemed to anticipate our current moment and the con on the golden escalator:\n\n> When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents . . . is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity—to join in the cry of danger to liberty—to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day—It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.”\n\nHamilton also paid close attention to the crimes and misdemeanors that such a scoundrel might commit, and how the country could protect itself from them. He wrote two Federalist essays about impeachment, and, as Chernow noted recently in the Washington _Post_, he would “certainly have endorsed” the current inquiry in the House. Only willful resistance to fact can obscure the reality that Trump, with the help of his lawyer [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani) and various others, tried to extort a vulnerable ally in order to gain an advantage in the 2020 election campaign. The White House finally released three hundred and ninety-­one million dollars in defense funds to Ukraine on September 11th—not owing to a fit of moral reconsideration but, it would appear, because two days earlier the House had launched its inquiry into allegations that Trump had tried to press Ukraine into investigating a political opponent. Given the abundance of documentary evidence, testimony from high-ranking public officials, and self-incriminating public statements by Trump, Hamilton would have seconded the sentiments expressed by [Adam Schiff](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trump-impeachment-hearing-adam-schiff-emphasizes-the-constitutional-stakes), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, who gavelled open the public hearings on impeachment on Wednesday, saying:\n\n> If we find that the President of the United States abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections  . . . must we simply get over it? Is this what Americans should now expect from their President? If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?\n\nThe first day of the hearings was notable for the sobriety, clarity, and unshakable dignity of the witnesses. William B. Taylor, Jr., a decorated Vietnam War veteran and the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who oversees Eastern European and Eurasian affairs, provided, as they had earlier in closed hearings, detailed testimony that the President of the United States sought to pressure the beleaguered President of Ukraine to sully the reputation of a Democratic rival, Joe Biden, in exchange for a meeting at the Oval Office and the release of the defense funds.\n\nAccording to Taylor, [Gordon Sondland](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-own-donor-diplomat-blows-up-his-impeachment-defense), the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, spoke with Trump by cell phone from a restaurant in Kiev; the President’s emphasis was single-minded. After finishing the call, Sondland told one of Taylor’s aides that “Trump cares more about the investigation of Biden” than about the fate of Ukraine. The date was July 26th––the day after Trump issued his now infamous demand that the Ukrainian President do him a “favor.”\n\nTaylor and Kent were impassive, formal witnesses, but they were direct about their sense of dismay. Essential questions emerged from the stories they told: How could a President engage in such brazen self-dealing? How could he play games with the security needs of a state that had been invaded by Russia, first in Crimea and then in the Donbass? “To withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,” Taylor said. “It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.”\n\nThe President dismissed the hearings as a “hoax.” He insisted that he was “too busy to watch,” although he retweeted more than a dozen video clips, articles, and commentaries in his putative defense. Conservative media outlets, from Fox News to Breitbart, declared the hearings “boring” and hoped their audience, the Trump base, would remain unmoved. Republican members of the Intelligence Committee, led by Jim Jordan, of Ohio, and Devin Nunes, of California, made every attempt to confound voters with misdirection and conspiracy theories. Nunes warned obscurely of the prospect of “nude ­pictures of Trump.” The Republicans ­complained that Taylor and Kent didn’t even know the President—their testimony was so “secondhand”—and yet these same legislators are in no rush to have the White House lift its block on witnesses with distinctly firsthand access—including Giuliani and the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.\n\nAs Hamilton, Madison, Adams, and their colleagues were drafting the founding documents of the country, they expressed concern about “foreign influence” on the Presidency. The sources of their anxiety then resided mainly in France and England. It was therefore powerful to hear Kent compare the plight of the American colonists in their struggle against the British crown to that of the post-Soviet Ukrainians as they have struggled against the Putin regime in Russia. Trump favors Moscow. He has repeatedly dismissed the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russians interfered in the 2016 election. As President, he has made it plain that he welcomes outside interference again, if it helps him win reëlection.\n\nThe President and his confederates have warned of the consequences of impeachment. In 2017, the self-described “dirty trickster” [Roger Stone](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/roger-stone), who is now on trial for lying to Congress, issued a characteristically Trumpish threat:\n\n> Try to impeach him. Just try it. You will have a spasm of violence in this country, an insurrection like you’ve never seen. Both sides are heavily armed, my friend. This is not 1974\\. The people will not stand for impeachment. A politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life.\n\nImpeachment is a grave business, and the risks are manifest. But no democracy can overlook evidence of abuse of power, bribery, and obstruction in the hope that an election will set things right.\n\nThese hearings and a potential Senate trial will never get to the full range of Donald Trump’s corruptions, be they on Fifth Avenue or Pennsylvania Avenue, in Istanbul, Moscow, or Riyadh. But the focus of Congress is on this particular and outrageous abuse of the public trust, and for now that must suffice. ♦\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1f152bc86f2c9a244c0f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hearings","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hearings"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1cb9397f5b30646d0644","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexander Hamilton","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexander-hamilton"},{"id":"5c2e1c997e716b454591add2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidents","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidents"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a02f72179605b11ad9967","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Remnick has been editor of *The New Yorker* since 1998 and a staff writer since 1992.

In one, President [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) is guilty of abusing power in many ways and on many occasions, and one such occasion is being [dissected and laid out in great detail](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/crazy-for-trump-on-the-gop-plan-to-keep-impeachment-partisan) on national television. In the other America and the other set of hearings, Democrats are out to get Trump at any cost, have latched onto a muddled and inconsequential incident, and are laying it out in great detail on national television in the hopes of convincing the public that the President has done something wrong. These two realities do not overlap.\n\nThe first reality is summed up in the [opening statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6548458-Schiff.html) by Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who said, “The questions presented by this impeachment inquiry are whether President Trump sought to exploit that ally’s [Ukraine’s] vulnerability and invite Ukraine’s interference in our elections. Whether President Trump sought to condition official acts, such as a White House meeting or U.S. military assistance, on Ukraine’s willingness to assist with two political investigations that would help his reëlection campaign. And if President Trump did either, whether such an abuse of his power is compatible with the office of the Presidency.”\n\nThe second reality is presented in an [eighteen-page memo](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/politics/read-republican-memo-trump-defense-impeachment-inquiry/index.html) prepared for House Republicans in advance of the hearings. Viewed from the vantage point of the first reality, the defense that this memo seems to propose is full of holes, as my colleague John Cassidy has [written](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-house-republicans-trump-impeachment-defense-is-full-of-holes). But for the second reality the memo paints a coherent picture. It says that the Ukraine story is confusing. It notes that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that Trump was wary of shouldering the burden of supporting it, and that there is no direct evidence that aid was held up pending the investigation—after all, in the end, the aid was released. According to the memo, Democrats have made a mountain out of the Ukraine molehill in order to get to Trump. In their zeal, they have been blind to Ukraine’s corruption and probable attempts to meddle in the U.S. election; they care only about Russian meddling, and only because they are out to undermine Trump.\n\nIn Reality One, the testimony of William B. Taylor, Jr., the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, contained a bombshell: information that the day after the infamous phone conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, a member of Taylor’s staff overheard a phone call between Trump and his Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, in which Trump demanded dirt from Ukraine on the Bidens. In Reality One, every detail matters, and together the details line up to create a chronology of “regular” foreign policy, as [Taylor put it](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/22/us/politics/william-taylor-ukraine-testimony.html), doing protracted losing battle against “highly irregular” foreign policy. But in Reality Two Taylor’s testimony is itself further proof of the conspiracy against Trump.\n\nEach reality is impenetrable to the other. If you hold to Reality One, no amount of evidence that the Democrats are out to get Trump will change your mind—on the contrary, you believe that the Democrats should use anything they can get their hands on to try to expose the President’s malfeasance and get him removed from office. If you hold to Reality Two, all the evidence summoned by the Democrats will make you only more convinced that they are out to get the President, and the more evidence there is, the more obscure the Ukraine story will seem. The gap between these realities makes it difficult even to analyze the impeachment proceedings. In the framework of Reality One, Republicans appear to be mounting silly and shaky defenses or throwing up smoke screens by demanding an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden. But Republicans are not actually defending the President against accusations of abuse of power; instead, they are mounting an offense against the Democrats, whose very enterprise they consider illegitimate.\n\nOf course, these realities do not have equal validity—although, unlike other Trump-era conflicts, this argument is not primarily one between facts and lies. This is an argument about what political power means. In Reality One, political power is governed by values, norms, history, procedure, and law. In Reality Two, political power aims to be absolute—its limit is what the President can get away with. Neither side is explicitly stating its position in this argument. Schiff came close when he said, at the beginning of his opening statement, that the outcome of the hearings will “affect not only the future of this Presidency but the future of the Presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their Commander-in-Chief.” But then he turned to laying out the Ukraine case. The side of Reality One is acting as though this were a legal prosecution. The side of Reality Two is denying the prosecution’s legitimacy. The differences between these realities are less factual than they are moral and political (in the deep, rather than partisan, sense of the word “politics”).\n\nThe realities are not equivalent, but they are in a sort of equilibrium. An equilibrium always favors the status quo. To upset the equilibrium, the Democrats would have to devise a strategy that would penetrate the Republicans’ reality bubble. That is likely impossible. But, if it's possible at all, it probably requires an approach that is less like a narrow prosecution and more like an attack on all fronts: on the President’s self-dealing; the profits he has extracted, using the office of the Presidency, from his hotels and resorts; the profits and roles in the Administration of the President’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner; the family’s relationship with Saudi Arabia; the malfeasance of issuing and revoking security clearances; the accusations of sexual assault; the cheating of charities; the still-unseen tax returns; and much, much more. No matter the approach, the outcome appears predictable: the House indicts and the Senate acquits. But at least the impeachment hearings ought to lay down a record of abuses that will make future historians blush, rather than a protocol of the time that the Democrats tried to get Trump on the one obscure smoking gun they had—and failed.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca42396212cbb9fc9d1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"House of Representatives","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"house-of-representatives"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

Read more of our [coverage of the impeachment hearings](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/impeachment).* \n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn Wednesday, members of the House Intelligence Committee questioned two witnesses in the first public hearing of the Trump impeachment inquiry: William Taylor, the acting Ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. Taylor was, as [Eric Lach wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/william-taylors-unspinnable-testimony-against-donald-trump), “sober and deliberate.” In his opening statement and in his responses to the committee members’ questions, Taylor described the Trump Administration’s “confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy toward the Ukraine.” Kent told a similar story, describing efforts by Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, to pressure the government of Ukraine to “gin up” investigations into Trump’s political rivals—efforts that Kent said wound up “infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine.”\n\nOn Wednesday, as Taylor and Kent offered their testimony, Republicans on the committee did their best to scoff at, undercut, and make a circus of the proceedings. “There is one witness,” [Jim Jordan](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/jim-jordan-tries-to-recast-trump-as-the-hero-of-the-ukraine-scandal), the Ohio Republican who was recently appointed to the committee to serve as a kind of inquisitorial ringer, said, “one witness they won’t bring in front of us, they won’t bring in front of the American people, and that’s the guy who started it all—the whistle-blower.” As Adam Gopnik [has written](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-is-trump-obsessed-with-outing-the-whistle-blower), the anonymous government whistle-blower who submitted a complaint about Trump’s July 25th call with the President of Ukraine—the complaint that set off a sequence of events that has resulted in the impeachment inquiry—has emerged as a kind of “comic-book nemesis” for the President. Representative Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, responded. “I’d be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome,” he said, gesturing to the witness tables and eliciting a brief moment of laughter, “to take a seat right there.” \n\nOn Friday, the witness slated to appear before the committee is the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose ouster, in May, caused wide concern among members of the Foreign Service. In September, [David Remnick wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-floodgates-open-on-trump) that Yovanovitch was known as a “deeply knowledgeable, experienced, and nonpartisan diplomat” who had “wound up on the wrong side of the Trump circle.” Unlike Taylor or Kent, Yovanovitch wasn’t just a witness to the machinations at the heart of the impeachment probe—she was subject to them. Watch Friday’s hearing live, above.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d3a2710c62d108154f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d3a2710c62d108154f7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Live","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"live"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Live","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"live"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Taylor, wearing a dark suit and wire glasses, his salt-and-pepper hair gently parted, is glancing down at his notes. Beside him, three text boxes contain what Fox News wanted its viewers to know about the congressional witness. “*OCT 23: PRESIDENT TRUMP DISMISSED TAYLOR AS A ‘NEVER TRUMPER*{: .small},’&nbsp;” the first box reads. “*WH CALLED TAYLOR’S CLOSED-DOOR TESTIMONY ‘TRIPLE HEARSAY*{: .small},’&nbsp;” the second box reads. “*GOP SAYS TAYLOR HAD NO FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE  ABOUT UKRAINE AID*{: .small},” the final box reads. The other image was a corresponding screen grab of Taylor from MSNBC. Instead of three text boxes, the MSNBC graphics producers placed a single box with three bullet points: “Top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine since June”; “Testified he had ‘clear understanding’ aid tied to probes”; and “Texted it would be ‘crazy’ to withhold Ukraine military aid.” \n\nInevitably, in the days to come, Republicans will rely on their supporters in the media to present the impeachment hearings as a matter of interpretation. In the moment, though, Taylor, a West Point graduate, Vietnam veteran, and longtime diplomat, was sober and deliberate. Like his co-testifier today, George Kent, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Taylor took pains during his opening remarks to describe himself as nonpartisan. “I am not here to take one side or the other,” he said. “My sole purpose is to provide facts as I know them.” He carefully described the situation he stepped into when he became the acting Ambassador this summer. There were, he discovered, two channels of American policy toward Ukraine. There was the “regular” channel, in which he interacted with Kent and officials at the National Security Council, and there was the “irregular” channel, which included [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), President Trump’s lawyer; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; and others. It was through this “irregular” channel, Taylor said, that hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance and a White House visit were used to pressure [Ukraine](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ukraine) to provide Trump with political ammunition against the campaign of [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden).  \n\nTaylor made clear the very real stakes of the political and security situation in Ukraine, noting that lives were lost in the current conflict while Giuliani and others allegedly used security assistance as a bargaining chip. He also offered a bit of news: recently, Taylor told the committee, he became aware that a member of his staff was at a restaurant with [Gordon Sondland](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-own-donor-diplomat-blows-up-his-impeachment-defense), the Ambassador to the European Union and occasional member of the “irregular” channel, on July 26th. At that restaurant, Sondland had a phone call with Trump that was loud enough for the table to overhear. According to Taylor’s staffer, Trump pressed Sondland about “the investigations.” And Sondland, after the call, told the staffer that Trump cared more about the investigation that he wanted into Biden and his son than about Ukraine. \n\nIn his opening, Taylor described how, when he was first offered the opportunity to return to government service and serve as acting Ambassador this summer, he consulted with two people: his wife and an old mentor. His wife opposed his taking the job. But his mentor told him that, if his government asked him to do something, and if he could “be effective” in its execution, then he should do it. So far today, it looks like he’s taking that advice again.

The committee’s staff had recently drawn up draft articles of impeachment for the members to consider, and public hearings were scheduled to begin at the end of the month, followed by a vote. It was not at all clear, however, that impeachment would be successful. Democrats controlled the House and Senate, but failure to secure a bipartisan vote in committee, in all likelihood, would mean that Richard Nixon would survive a House vote on impeachment and escape a Senate trial. The House members who gathered in Railsback’s office “realized that the impeachment of the president was in their hands,” the historian Timothy Naftali writes in the new book [“Impeachment: An American History.](https://www.amazon.com/Impeachment-American-History-Jon-Meacham/dp/1984853783)” As Raymond Thornton, an Arkansas Democrat who was part of the group, later said, “I considered that this was most likely the most important task that I would ever have in government and that my whole effort should be given to the study of it and to try to come up with an answer that was fair and right and which I could live with for the rest of my life.” \n\nNext week, the House Intelligence Committee is set to begin holding public hearings on the impeachment of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), but the chances of a similar bipartisan coalition emerging—in either the House or the Senate—are slim. When participants in the “fragile coalition,” as the group came to be called, decided to support articles of impeachment, they effectively ended Nixon’s Presidency. Two weeks later, Nixon resigned. The following year, all seven members of the group agreed to be [interviewed](https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/butler-hiltonhead/) by historians from St. Joseph’s College, in Rensselaer, Indiana, and participated in a series of recorded group conversations at a resort in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The transcripts make for instructive—and deflating—reading, underscoring just how much partisanship and tribalism has distorted our politics in the nearly half century since Watergate. \n\nIt was Walter Flowers, an Alabama Democrat, who first approached Railsback and proposed that they convene a meeting of committee members from both parties. Flowers’s district had gone overwhelmingly for Nixon in the 1972 election. Railsback and Flowers had been friends for several years and played paddle ball together. After one hearing, Railsback recalled, “Walter said, ‘Rails, why don’t you get your guys together, and I’ll get mine and let’s sit down and visit about this.’&nbsp;” The seven congressmen met for the first time the following day in Railsback’s office in the Rayburn House Office Building. Railsback, the most senior moderate Republican on the committee, was viewed by members of both parties as a critical undecided vote. He could make it possible for other Republicans to consider impeachment. He had invited a number of Republican colleagues but was unsure of who would show up. Caldwell Butler, a conservative freshman from a staunchly Republican district in Roanoke, Virginia, was perhaps the most surprising attendee. Butler had heard about the meeting from Jim Mann, a Democrat from a conservative district in South Carolina, and told him that he was interested in joining. \n\nIn considering the first use of impeachment against the executive branch in more than a century, the members of the group—all former lawyers—had set about their work with a level of seriousness and attention to detail that they believed was in keeping with the enormity of the task. Railsback recalled a pivotal weekend, just before the group met, when he returned home to Western Springs, Illinois, and was able to carefully examine documents prepared for the committee by John Doar, the inquiry’s lead counsel. “I could see that the President had, in fact, not been telling the American public the truth, and this was direct involvement on his part,” he said. “There were statements that he made that had been reliably contradicted. And that all of the sudden gave me a sense of decision and conclusion and finality that I could vote for impeachment and have good evidence behind me.” Thornton, whose district voted overwhelmingly for Nixon, rented an apartment in Washington for the month of July, so that he could skip the daily forty-five-minute commute to and from his house in Virginia and concentrate on impeachment. “I stayed there throughout the entire period of time and had a little single bedroom foldout bed,” he said. ”It gave me two hours a day that I wouldn’t have had otherwise.” \n\nThe men were all conscious of the potential political fallout in their districts. “The mail got so bad that the staff stopped showing it to me,” William Cohen, a Maine Republican who went on to the Senate and was later appointed Secretary of Defense, in the Clinton Administration, said. “It was so vicious and violent, anti-Semitic. It was obscene.” But Cohen had resolved to set aside political considerations. “I had reconciled myself to the fact that whatever I did that it was going to be difficult for me, back in my district, difficult to explain to my constituents,” he said. “What I was more concerned with was that I did what I felt was right.” Hamilton Fish, a New York Republican, had “come to the decision that you could not conduct this by a poll,” he said. Impeachment was a “very defined constitutional responsibility, which the public had no bearing on it whatsoever.”\n\nDuring their first meeting, beginning at about 8 *A.M.*{: .small} on Tuesday, July 23rd, the seven men sat together around a long table and, over breakfast pastries and coffee, began talking through the particular issues that had troubled them during the hearings. It quickly became clear that they were all leaning toward impeachment, focussing, in particular, on the Watergate coverup and Nixon’s manipulation of governmental agencies, such as the C.I.A., F.B.I., and I.R.S. The consensus in the group was that the final articles of impeachment should emphasize charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice that could be tied directly back to the President. Over the next few days, they labored over the language of the articles and began circulating their work with the rest of the committee. Word filtered back to the White House that Nixon’s support among Southern Democrats had disintegrated. The end of the Nixon Presidency was finally visible. “The committee is ending up with a solid bipartisan group—including conservative Southern Democrats—in favor of impeachment, and this fact has already had a powerful impact on the House, and will have a similarly strong impact on the Senate and on the country at large,” [Elizabeth Drew wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/10/28/a-reporter-in-washington-d-c-iii-summer-notes-2) in this magazine. “It will be realized that this widely disparate group studied the evidence at length—and now its seemingly deliberate pace is seen as helpful, too—and took a stand for impeachment.”\n\nThe obvious question is whether such a fragile coalition could ever come together today. Because of their centrist leanings, the seven freshmen Democratic members—the [so-called Security Democrats](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/how-the-security-democrats-flipped-on-impeachment)—who co-published an op-ed in the Washington *Post* backing an impeachment inquiry on the Ukraine allegations, resemble, in some ways, the Southern Democrats during Watergate. But moderate Republicans, in the mold of Railsback and Cohen, are virtually nonexistent in Congress today. The G.O.P. has moved rightward, and Trump has remade the Party in his own image. For any member whose loyalty wavers, the conservative media machine is unrelenting. \n\nMeanwhile, the Republican minority on the Judiciary Committee, the body that would conduct the initial vote on articles of impeachment, is populated by Trump stalwarts like Matt Gaetz, of Florida, who, last month, led the group that [stormed the secure room](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-circus-comes-to-the-house-impeachment-inquiry) where the Intelligence Committee was conducting its depositions, and Louie Gohmert, of Texas, who recently said that impeachment was pushing the country toward “[civil war](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/468419-gop-lawmaker-invokes-civil-war-after-house-votes-on-trump-impeachment).” According to the transcripts released by the House Intelligence Committee, so far, Republicans have largely treated the closed-door witness testimonies with contempt—grandstanding, lambasting the process, and openly indulging in conspiracy theories. When the House voted, last week, on whether to approve an impeachment inquiry, not a single Republican supported it. “They’re acting out of fear or complicity,” Cohen told me in a telephone interview this week. “It’s the silence of the lambs.”\n\nYet it does not seem impossible for the dynamics to shift. Nineteen Republicans in the House and four Republicans in the Senate have announced that they will not seek reëlection next year, which, theoretically, could free them to vote their consciences. The lawmakers leaving Congress include Will Hurd, of Texas, the lone African-American in the G.O.P. caucus and a well-known moderate, and Francis Rooney, of Florida, who became the first Republican member of Congress to indicate that he was open to supporting articles of impeachment against President Trump. “I want to get the facts and do the right thing, because I’ll be looking at my children a lot longer than I’m looking to anybody in this building,” [Rooney said](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/us/politics/francis-rooney-retirement-impeachment.html) last month. Among the Senate Republicans, twenty of whom would need to join Democrats in removing Trump, Mitt Romney, of Utah, has been the most vocal Republican critic of the President on Ukraine, but other possible allies for Democrats on impeachment include Lamar Alexander, of Tennessee, who is retiring next year and has a record of working with Democrats over the course of his four-decade career; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, who has been critical of the Trump Administration; Cory Gardner, a vulnerable senator from Colorado who is up for reëlection; and Susan Collins, who faces a tough race in Maine.\n\nUltimately, a bipartisan impeachment of Trump could begin modestly. All that is needed is for a handful of Republicans to weigh impeachment with the same sense of duty as the members of the fragile coalition did during the historic summer of 1974. That, in turn, could embolden others. The future of American democracy may, once again, depend on a willingness to prioritize the Constitution and our system of governance over party and politics.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cc12710c62d10815492","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Richard Nixon","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"richard-nixon"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1ca52396212cbb9fc9d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Watergate","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"watergate"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5919d9ce0efe820724926ba0","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Michael Luo is the editor of newyorker.com and oversees the magazine’s digital presence across all platforms.

For the past six weeks or so, the White House and congressional Republicans have been insisting, contrary to all the evidence, that Trump—even as he asked the President of Ukraine to open politically sensitive investigations, including one involving the [Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden) family—didn’t back up this request with a threat to suspend vital U.S. military aid. In the messaging lexicon of Trump et al., “No quid pro quo” had replaced “No collusion.”\n\nGiven all the information contained in the anonymous whistle-blower’s complaint, which first brought the Ukraine story to light, and the depositions that were subsequently provided to Congress by career diplomats, such as [William Taylor](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-ambassador-william-taylors-testimony-was-so-damaging-to-trump) and Marie Yovanovitch, this Presidential claim of innocence was highly contentious, to say the least. But it gave Trump’s Republican enablers something to parrot when they went on cable-news shows. In  the following weeks, they even refined the story a bit to suggest that, even if Trump had wanted to put the squeeze on the Ukrainians by suspending U.S. aid, the government in Kiev never learned about this, so it’s all much ado about nothing.\n\nEnter Gordon Sondland—the Seattle hotelier and Trump donor who serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, a position from which he somehow emerged as the diplomatic point man in the Ukraine mess—and Kurt Volker, a career Foreign Service officer who served as the U.S. permanent representative to *NATO*{: .small} a decade ago and returned to public service in 2017, as the State Department’s special representative for Ukraine. When Sondland testified last month, he said that earlier this year Trump had ordered him and other diplomats to work with [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), the progenitor of the Ukraine caper, but that he “did not understand until much later” the real nature of the escapade; he also claimed that Trump had assured him that there was [no quid pro quo](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sondland-testimony-read-the-full-text-of-eu-ambassadors-statement-in-impeachment-inquiry-today/). Volker, in his [opening statement](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/christopherm51/kurt-volker-testimony-congress-ukraine-trump) to congressional investigators last month, conceded that he had been concerned that “a negative narrative about Ukraine” was reaching Trump, but he also insisted that “at no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.”\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\nOn Tuesday, the House Democrats released some revised [testimony](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/sondland-changes-testimony-acknowledges-delivering-quid-pro-quo-message-ukraine-n1076736) from Sondland, in which he claimed that statements from other officials, including Taylor, had “refreshed” his memory. One of the things that Sondland remembered was a September 1st conversation with Andriy Yermak, a key adviser to [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president), the Ukrainian President, in which he told Yermak that “the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.”\n\nSo much for the Ukrainian government not getting the message. But what was the nature of the “anti-corruption statement” that Sondland and other Trump cronies were demanding? While maintaining a straight face, the President’s apologists have suggested that he was concerned about generalized graft in the former Soviet republic and that what he wanted from Zelensky was an over-all commitment to clean up the country, rather than dirt on [Hunter Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign) and his work for the Ukrainian company Burisma, or on any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign. Even some Trump supporters would privately concede that the notion of the current President as a good-government type isn’t exactly credible, but it was apparently the best line that the White House could come up with. Unfortunately for Trump, there is now documented evidence that contradicts it.\n\nAmong the materials that the House Democrats [released](https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1191796014237331457) on Tuesday were a pair of text messages that Volker sent to Yermak on August 13th, a couple of weeks after Trump had spoken on the phone with Zelensky. In these messages, Volker told Yermak precisely what the Ukrainian President should say in his public statement about starting a corruption investigation. This is some of the language that Volker suggested for Zelensky: \n\n> “Special attention should be paid to the problem of interference in\n> the political processes of the United States, especially with the\n> alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare\n> that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a\n> transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and\n> episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S.\n> elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem\n> in the future.”\n\nWhat will the White House do now that its cover story has been blown from inside?  Predictably enough, its immediate reaction was to claim that black is white. The newly released transcripts “show there is even less evidence for this illegitimate impeachment sham than previously thought,” Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a [statement](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/05/sondland-reverses-himself-on-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-000318).\n\nA possible fallback strategy that I have long expected Team Trump to adopt at some stage is to make the argument that, although what Trump and Giuliani were up to in Ukraine doesn’t look good, it wasn’t an impeachable offense, or any criminal offense at all. In some offhand comments that he made to reporters last month, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, appeared to preview this strategy, although he subsequently backed away from it.\n\nUnfortunately for the Trump camp, Sondland also undercut this line of defense. The [squeeze](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6540444-Gordon-Sondland-Testimony.html#document/p308/a534072) on Kiev, he said, began with discussions of getting the Ukrainians to “give a statement about corruption. And then, no, corruption isn’t enough, we need to talk about the 2016 election and the Burisma investigations.” A Democratic staffer asked Sondland if he believed that pressing the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens and involving “Ukrainians directly or indirectly in the President’s 2020 reelection campaign” would be illegal. Sondland responded, “I’m not a lawyer, but I assume so.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1d492710c62d1081550f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ukraine","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ukraine"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

In attendance were Attorney General [Jeff Sessions](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-sessions), the White House adviser Stephen Miller, and an official at the Department of Homeland Security named [Gene Hamilton](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-official-behind-the-end-of-daca-explains-himself), along with the President’s chief of staff, [John Kelly](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-kelly), Kelly’s own chief of staff, Kirstjen Nielsen, and the acting D.H.S. Secretary, Elaine Duke. Miller scheduled the meeting for a day when [Jared Kushner](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jared-kushner), a moderate voice on immigration, was out of town. On the campaign trail, the President vowed to undo Barack Obama’s signature immigration policies, but, once in office, he bowed to the overwhelming popularity of *DACA*{: .small} and claimed that he would treat its recipients “with heart.” Now Sessions and Miller were leading an effort to dismantle the program. “The President wanted to end *DACA*{: .small}, they said, and Duke was going to be the one to issue a memo killing it,” the *Times* reporters Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D. Shear report in their recent book “[Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration](https://www.amazon.com/Border-Wars-Inside-Assault-Immigration/dp/1982117397).” “Miller and everyone else around the table was acting like this was a done deal.” \n\nOn Tuesday, after two years of wrangling in the federal courts, the Supreme Court will hear a suite of cases challenging the Trump Administration’s decision to cancel *DACA*{: .small}. A team of lawyers from the firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, along with several groups of *DACA*{: .small} recipients, advocates, universities, and multiple states nationwide, will argue that the President ended *DACA*{: .small} without properly considering the impact the decision would have on its seven hundred thousand recipients and their families—more than a million people in total. A federal statute called the Administrative Procedures Act requires the government to provide transparent and substantial reasons for adopting public policies, whereas the Trump Administration, these groups have argued, acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” way, a violation of the law. \n\nIn the months before the August 24th White House meeting, a group of ten Republican state attorneys general, working in close coördination with Sessions, Miller, and Hamilton, wrote a letter to the Justice Department threatening to sue the government unless it ended *DACA*{: .small}. It wasn’t clear that the attorneys general would follow through with an actual lawsuit; nor was it assured that they could win in court. But their threat served as a pretext for Sessions to intercede. At the White House, Sessions and the other immigration hard-liners laid out their plan. According to a record of the meeting, a Justice Department memo “outlining the legal reasons that the *DACA*{: .small} program is unlawful” would be sent to D.H.S. by September 1st. D.H.S., in turn, would “draft a memorandum” to effectively end the *DACA*{: .small} program. The Republican state attorneys general threatening to sue would “dismiss” their case by September 5th. Meanwhile, the Administration would “develop a unified list of legislative items” for the President to bring to Congress to force an exchange: if Congress took up the President’s legislative priorities on immigration (increasing *ICE*{: .small} enforcement and building a wall along the southern U.S. border), then Trump would “consider signing legislation that addresses individuals who had previously been eligible to receive *DACA*{: .small} permits.”\n\nThe authors of *DACA*{: .small} in the Obama Administration were aware that the program would draw intense scrutiny. Janet Napolitano, who was the secretary of D.H.S. when the program was adopted, told me, “It was done with the assumption that, somewhere along the line, somebody was going to try to stop it.” In early 2012, teams of lawyers at the White House and Department of Homeland Security examined every aspect of the policy, and, according to an analysis by the Office of Legal Counsel, found it to be consistent with a well-established concept in criminal and immigration case law known as prosecutorial discretion. Every Presidential Administration since Eisenhower’s has extended reprieves from deportation, known as deferred action, to certain categories of undocumented immigrants who are considered low priorities for arrest. Since 1981, federal regulations explicitly authorized such immigrants to work in the United States. \n\n*DACA*{: .small} came with an additional slate of eligibility requirements. Recipients, for instance, had to be either a student, a high-school graduate, or a member of the armed forces, and they couldn’t have a criminal record. “We made sure that the process that we set up for qualifying young people for *DACA*{: .small} was designed to do a case-by-case evaluation, that it wasn’t just a blanket grant of immunity from deportation,” Napolitano said. If applicants met the criteria, they could renew their *DACA*{: .small} status every two years, allowing them to work, apply for bank loans, and qualify for financial aid to go to college. Often, this afforded stability not just for individual recipients but for their entire families. Luis Cortes, one of the attorneys who will be defending *DACA*{: .small} at the Supreme Court on Tuesday, told me, “There are *DACA*{: .small} recipients who are taking care of their parents. They have more stable jobs because they can get Social Security numbers. Some of them have committed to mortgages. They have siblings or kids.”\n\nCortes, who was born in Michoacán, Mexico, came to the United States with his parents when he was a year old. He is now thirty-one, stocky and bespectacled, with wavy, dark hair and tattoos spidering up his forearms. His father was later deported, and the legal status of the rest of the family remains complicated. Cortes and his mother are undocumented, while his three younger siblings, who were born in the U.S., are American citizens. “The whole slogan you hear now—‘undocumented, unafraid’—is somewhat new,” he said. “I remember when I was undocumented and very afraid.” When President Obama announced *DACA*{: .small}, in the summer of 2012, Cortes had just finished his second year of law school. “I was very incredulous about the whole thing,” Cortes said. “I was, like, They want us to give all of that information about ourselves to the government!” Out of caution, he waited a year before applying. Yet, when he graduated, it was his *DACA*{: .small} status that allowed him to find a job at a small law firm just outside of Seattle. \n\nIn February, 2017, three *ICE*{: .small} officers in Des Moines, Washington, arrested one of Cortes’s clients, a *DACA*{: .small} recipient named [Daniel Ramirez](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-case-that-could-determine-the-future-for-dreamers), on the false pretense that he belonged to a gang. Barely a month into the Trump era, it was the first instance of the government targeting a *DACA*{: .small} recipient for deportation. A team of lawyers from Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and the advocacy group Public Counsel joined Cortes in representing Ramirez. On September 5th, they were still litigating the case when Sessions made the formal announcement that Trump had decided to cancel *DACA*{: .small} outright. A total of nine lawsuits were filed nationwide, including one from Cortes and the lawyers at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, to block the Administration’s move. (Three federal courts have since issued injunctions halting the cancellation of the program on the grounds that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act; current recipients have been allowed to renew their status as the government’s appeals move through the courts.) During oral arguments before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Cortes will be sitting at the counsel’s table alongside the attorney general of California and Ted Olson, of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, who is a former Solicitor General and a longtime litigator at the Supreme Court. “As a lawyer, I’m very stoked about it,” Cortes said. “I didn’t think I would have a Supreme Court case this early on in my career. But it’s also daunting. I’m going to be looking at the people who get to decide whether my clients are going to get deported, and me along with them.”\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe Trump Administration has offered a shifting set of explanations for the cancellation of *DACA*{: .small}. On September 5, 2017, the President claimed that “the program is unlawful and unconstitutional and cannot be successfully defended in court.” That same day, in his own [announcement](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-daca-decision-puts-dreamers-future-in-the-hands-of-congress), Sessions said, without citing any evidence, that *DACA*{: .small} had encouraged illegal immigration. In court, the Administration argued that its rationale for ending *DACA*{: .small} was to address the threat of a lawsuit by the Republican state attorneys general. After a string of losses in the federal courts, the Administration issued an additional policy rationale, in a document called the Nielsen Memorandum: ending *DACA*{: .small}, it said, sent a “message” to discourage future immigrants from travelling to the border. “This case is not about whether the government can *ever* end *DACA*{: .small} or some other program,” Trudy Rebert, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Law Center, which also filed suit to block the Administration’s cancellation of *DACA*{: .small}, told me. “It’s about whether they did so lawfully—and, specifically, whether they did so in an ‘arbitrary and capricious’ manner or undertook reasoned decision-making. Agencies have a lot of power. Their decisions affect a lot of people’s lives, and these basic legal requirements are intended to insure some measure of accountability.” \n\nFor all the Administration’s evolving arguments, the White House meeting held on August 24, 2017, remains significant. Lawyers for the government have insisted that Elaine Duke, a career civil servant who’d been in charge of D.H.S. for less than a month, exercised her own discretion in ending *DACA*{: .small} and that, as a result, the courts could not review or override the decision. She had arrived at the meeting thinking that it would be a policy discussion, Hirschfeld Davis and Shear report in “Border Wars.” Miller never told her that the true purpose of the gathering was to set in motion *DACA*{: .small}’s cancellation, a move that Hirschfeld Davis and Shear described as a “procedural ambush.” The government’s own record of the meeting, Rebert told me, undercuts the Administration’s subsequent claims that Duke had made the decision after a thorough consideration of the policy. “It’s clear here that the decision to end *DACA*{: .small} was made on August 24th,” Rebert said. The process was “not that Secretary Duke got a letter from Attorney General Sessions and then independently decided to end *DACA*{: .small}.” Duke’s memo provides no actual policy reasons for ending *DACA*{: .small}; it simply restates Sessions’s claim that *DACA*{: .small} was unlawful. If cancelling the program was a foregone conclusion, and Duke’s memo merely served as a rubber stamp, then, as a matter of public policy, the government cannot claim to have acted in good faith. \n\nA few weeks ago, I asked Napolitano what the Administration might have done differently to end *DACA*{: .small} in a more deliberative manner. “It would have been a real policy review,” she said. “It would have done a real cost-benefit analysis. It would have evaluated what the country was getting from *DACA*{: .small} recipients. It would have been a real administrative record.” (According to some estimates, if *DACA*{: .small} were rescinded, the U.S. economy would contract by more than four hundred billion dollars in the following decade.) Instead, she said, the Administration’s reasoning was “basically a one-liner”—that *DACA*{: .small} was unlawful and thus had to end. In a brief submitted to the Supreme Court on behalf of the *DACA*{: .small} recipients, Olson and Cortes point out that the Administration never bothered “to even consider” the legal arguments made by the previous Administration or to explain its “newfound disagreement.” “They never questioned DHS’s original reasons for adopting *DACA*{: .small},” the brief argues, “nor suggested that the circumstances supporting the policy had changed.”\n\nWhen I spoke with Olson, who’s presenting the case on Tuesday, he was ready with a range of arguments, from a defense of the lawfulness of *DACA*{: .small} to an indictment of how the Administration tried to end it. He also drew a comparison to a case from earlier this year involving the government’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the [2020 census](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-battle-over-the-census-citizenship-question-is-now-about-civil-rights). The Administration had claimed that the Justice Department had initiated the policy for the purpose of strengthening enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, but later testimony revealed that the White House had used that explanation as a cover. “The Supreme Court decided, ‘Well, you might be able to add that question, but you’ve got to be able to explain it, and you can’t give us bogus reasons for doing so,’&nbsp;” Olson told me. The *DACA*{: .small} case “is a rule-of-law case,” he added, “a rule-of-law case involving hundreds of thousands of individuals who will be hurt by an abrupt and unexplained and unjustified change in policy.” \n\nThere are a few potential outcomes at the Supreme Court. One is that the Justices rule directly on the lawfulness of the Administration’s cancellation of *DACA*{: .small}. The Court could also provide instructions for how the government would have to cancel *DACA*{: .small} if it wanted to do so lawfully. And, at the same time, the Court could even adopt a more sweeping stance on whether a policy like *DACA*{: .small} is lawful in the first place. In the meantime, Cortes’s *DACA*{: .small} status, which is good for two years, expires in 2021. Nonetheless, he plans to renew it in 2020, just in case something unexpected happens at the Supreme Court. “We’re anticipating a spring decision,” he told me. “So it might not be a bad idea to renew it around March and get an extra year.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e9a81ab3335f580f359","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1e9a81ab3335f580f359","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Deferred

Last month, to corral enough votes to keep the government running, he promised to dedicate some time to the fate of Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. In September, Donald Trump cancelled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era policy that protected seven hundred thousand of them from deportation—then called on Congress to pass legislation to reinstate the protections he’d just eliminated. After six months of floundering talks, McConnell gave the Senate a single week to come up with a solution. The debate began with low expectations. Several factions of lawmakers put forward proposals more or less on the fly. McConnell told colleagues that whatever bill he could pass in the Senate probably wouldn’t earn Trump’s support anyway. On Wednesday, the President proved McConnell right by threatening to veto any bill other than his own proposal, which offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers in exchange for overhauling the legal-immigration system and drastically increasing border security. When a centrist alternative appeared to be gaining broad bipartisan support on Thursday, the Administration attacked it in dramatic fashion to scare off Republican backers. It worked, and the week ended as it had begun, with no deal.\n\nThis outcome could only have pleased the anti-immigrant hard-liners in the White House and Senate. Stephen Miller, the President’s senior adviser, helped push Trump to cancel *DACA*{:.small} last year and has worked to scuttle congressional negotiations over the issue ever since. The Republican senators Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, and David Perdue, of Georgia, who last year proposed a bill to curb legal immigration that was considered extreme even by the standards of the Republican Party, this week saw key parts of their proposal come up for a vote. Other conservative Republicans, such as Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, who has typically occupied the extreme edge of G.O.P. opinion on immigration, found themselves in the middle of the debate. \n\nFour immigration measures came up for a vote on Thursday. Three were bills that dealt with the fate of Dreamers, while the fourth, an amendment introduced by Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican, was meant to punish sanctuary cities. All failed. The vote counts tell the real story, though. For all the extremist rhetoric coming from the White House, it was the moderate proposals that came the closest to passing. \n\nThe first measure, proposed by John McCain and Chris Coons, resembles what advocates have been calling a “Clean *DREAM*{:.small} Act,” a proposal to legalize the status of Dreamers without attaching any conservative-friendly concessions such as increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement. The bill received fifty-two votes, which wasn’t enough to clear the sixty-vote threshold necessary for it to survive the Senate. A second measure, proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the Common Sense Caucus—which was led by Susan Collins and had the support of Lindsey Graham, Jeff Flake, and Dick Durbin—was designed as a middle-of-the-road alternative. It, too, would create a path to citizenship for Dreamers, but it would also allocate twenty-five billion dollars to border security, and would prevent Dreamers from eventually sponsoring their parents for legal status. This bill got fifty-four votes. The third bill, the President’s preferred plan, was introduced by Grassley, and would have created protections for Dreamers while also redrawing the legal-immigration system and massively increasing border-security measures; it received only thirty-nine votes in favor. \n\nOne Republican senator, speaking anonymously to Politico, summed up the week: “The Administration made it difficult for some Republicans to try to publicly support anything.” In addition to the President’s repeated attacks, the Department of Homeland Security entered the political fray. On Thursday, it released a startlingly aggressive statement vilifying the bill supported by the Common Sense Caucus. One of the bill’s provisions called for immigration authorities to target for arrest only those undocumented immigrants who recently arrived in the country. This proposal, D.H.S. said, “would be the end of immigration enforcement in America” and “would effectively make the United States a Sanctuary Nation where ignoring the rule of law is encouraged.” Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, a supporter of Dreamers who has lobbied Trump for months on a compromise measure, was livid. “Who the hell wrote this?” he asked. “It sounded like something that came from a political hack, not D.H.S.” By the end of the week, moderates like Graham, whose proposals had the most support, nevertheless seemed marginalized. As a result of the pressure and rhetoric from the Administration, the legal-immigration system is a central subject of debate in Washington for the first time in years.  \n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court held a closed-door conference to consider a highly unusual appeal from the Department of Justice. In the months since Trump’s decision to end *DACA*{:.small}, immigrants-rights groups, *DACA*{:.small} recipients, and a handful of state and municipal governments have brought lawsuits against the Administration, and two federal judges have issued injunctions in their favor, halting the cancellation of the program. The Administration, according to these judges, failed to adequately consider the consequences of abruptly ending *DACA*{:.small}. The federal government wants the injunctions lifted so that *DACA*{:.small} can be fully phased out after March 5th. But it challenged the first injunction, issued by a federal judge in California, by skipping over an appeals court and petitioning the Supreme Court directly. It now looks increasingly likely that the Justices will not take up the case, and that, instead, they’ll allow it to play out in the lower courts. The legal battle could take several months. \n\nIn the meantime, the injunctions mean that *DACA*{:.small} recipients can apply to renew their status, which lasts for two years, until the courts provide further clarity. The open-endedness buys Dreamers much needed time, but the uncertainty over their status remains agonizing. It takes the government roughly three months to process *DACA*{:.small} applications. For those whose status has expired, even if they re-applied immediately after the first injunction was issued, early last month, they will have to live without protection until their paperwork is processed, meaning that they can’t work legally and are vulnerable to deportation. Congress could still step in to resolve this situation by simply extending *DACA*{:.small} for another year or two as a temporary fix. By March 23rd, Congress will have to vote on another funding resolution to keep the government open, and advocates hope that *DACA*{:.small} will be part of these funding negotiations. But McConnell has already declared that, after this week, he’s ready to move on.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1e362bc86f2c9a244b9e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"DACA","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daca"},{"id":"5c2e1c9b2bc86f2c9a2449e3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dreamers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dreamers"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bc86f2c9a24498f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republican Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republican-party"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

At first, WhatsApp wasn’t sure what was happening. Then the engineers, working with their counterparts at Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, realized that the voice and video calls were somehow infecting targeted phones with advanced spyware, using a penetration method that the company had never encountered before. Most disturbing to the investigators was that it appeared many of the targeted phones became infected whether the calls were answered or not—what’s known as a zero-click vulnerability. \n\nThe malware then instructed the targeted phones to upload their content to servers owned by Amazon Web Services and other companies, where the stolen data was stored and could be accessed by the intruders. After the malware was loaded on some of the targeted phones, the call logs were wiped. Victims who heard their phones ringing overnight found no evidence of the calls in the morning.\n\nOn May 13th, WhatsApp announced that it had discovered the vulnerability. In a statement, the company said that the spyware appeared to be the work of a commercial entity, but it did not identify the perpetrator by name. WhatsApp patched the vulnerability and, as part of its investigation, identified more than fourteen hundred phone numbers that the malware had targeted. In most cases, WhatsApp had no idea whom the numbers belonged to, because of the company’s privacy and data-retention rules. So WhatsApp gave the list of phone numbers to the Citizen Lab, a research laboratory at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs, where a team of cyber experts tried to determine whether any of the numbers belonged to civil-society members.\n\nOn Tuesday, WhatsApp took the extraordinary step of announcing that it had traced the malware back to NSO Group, a spyware-maker based in Israel, and filed a lawsuit against the company—and also its parent, Q Cyber Technologies—in a Northern California court, accusing it of “unlawful access and use” of WhatsApp computers. According to the lawsuit, NSO Group developed the malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on targeted devices, allowing intruders to bypass WhatsApp’s encryption. \n\nThe lawsuit also details how NSO Group may have planned the attack, noting that the company had created a series of WhatsApp accounts that were used to initiate the calls which injected the spyware onto the victims’ phones. An NSO Group employee appeared to reach out directly to someone involved in patching the WhatsApp vulnerability after it was disclosed, writing, “You just closed our biggest remote for cellular.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s on the news all over the world,” according to the lawsuit.\n\nNSO Group said in a statement in response to the lawsuit, “In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today’s allegations and will vigorously fight them. The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists.” In September, NSO Group announced the appointment of new, high-profile advisers, including Tom Ridge, the first U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, in an effort to improve its global image. \n\nIn a statement to its users on Tuesday, WhatsApp said, “There must be strong legal oversight of cyber weapons like the one used in this attack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and freedoms people deserve wherever they are in the world. Human rights groups have documented a disturbing trend that such tools have been used to attack journalists and human rights defenders.”\n\nThe Citizen Lab’s investigation into the identities of the victims is ongoing. So far, the university laboratory said that the attacks targeted at least a hundred members of civil society in at least twenty countries. The list of targets includes prominent religious leaders of multiple faiths, well-known journalists and television personalities, and human-rights activists and human-rights lawyers. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, said, “It is the largest attack on civil society that we know of using this kind of vulnerability.” He added that the Citizen Lab is not releasing the names of the victims at this time, because of confidentiality restrictions.\n\nIn addition to targeting civil-society members, the malware was used against diplomats and foreign government officials, presumably by NSO Group’s customers, which include law-enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\n*This piece has been updated to include a comment from NSO

Parnas and Igor Fruman](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giulianis-two-indicted-associates-could-have-a-lot-to-say) were arrested at Dulles International Airport, Parnas was visiting Manhattan. It was during the U.N. General Assembly, and a large Ukrainian delegation was in town. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine and grew up in Brooklyn, lives in Florida and runs an energy business with a Wall Street address. He was staying at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, just off of Columbus Circle, which has been his favorite hotel “from the first day it opened,” he told me. Parnas, a longtime fan of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s real-estate businesses, was an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign for President. Now, after working on behalf of Trump’s lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), to investigate Joe Biden and [his son Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), in Ukraine, Parnas and Fruman are at the center of the investigation that could result in the President’s impeachment.\n\nTwo days after the Speaker of the House, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), announced that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, potentially charging him with seeking to enlist the help of the Ukrainian government to damage Biden’s campaign, Parnas sat down with me at a table for two at Bouchon Bakery, near his hotel, and reminisced about his work as Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine and elsewhere, where he collected dirt on the Bidens and the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie Yovanovitch. At our meeting, Parnas was accompanied by a bodyguard, who watched from a distance. “You can’t be too careful,” he said. He ordered a coffee and handed me a thick business card for Global Energy Producers, on which he is listed as the company’s C.E.O. and co-founder. (The Web site for the company now reads, “Looks Like You’re Lost.”) \n\nParnas had sat in on many of Giuliani’s phone calls and meetings involving Ukraine, he said, including one between Giuliani and an envoy of Volodymyr Zelensky, the new Ukrainian President, which took place in Madrid. Giuliani told me that, at this meeting, he received assurances that Zelensky’s administration would pursue several investigations sought by Trump, including one into the Bidens. Parnas was clearly proud of his work for Giuliani and seemed unfazed by his proximity to the impeachment inquiry. “I’m a businessman who obviously is close to the mayor, is close to the President,” he said. “I love the President. I love the Administration. I fully support him and honestly think he is going to go down as probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Presidents ever. What he’s doing is outstanding.” \n\nParnas was born in February, 1972, in the port city of Odessa, in southwestern Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. He was three when his family moved to the United States. “I came here as a legal immigrant, through a legal process,” he said. His family settled in Detroit, where they lived for about a year, before relocating to Brooklyn. When Parnas was sixteen, he worked at Kings Highway Realty, selling Trump Organization co-ops. “That was my first time knowing who Trump was, but, growing up in that area, you knew who Trump was, because his name was all over the place,” he said. \n\nIn 1995, when Parnas was twenty-three, he moved from Brooklyn to Florida. On visits to New York, he stayed at Trump properties. Parnas said that, until Trump announced his run for the Presidency, on June 16, 2015, he didn’t consider himself a Republican or a Democrat. “I was really never heavy into politics, never really contributed,” he said. Then, in June, 2015, Parnas’s teen-age son, Aaron, called his father. “Dad, I think one of your friends is running for President,” he joked. Aaron told me that, after Trump announced his candidacy, he called the Trump campaign to get passes to go with his father to a Trump rally in Florida. \n\nParnas soon became a regular at Trump’s rallies and other gatherings. “I started donating. We started to help raise money,” he said. Gradually, Parnas said that he got to know other Trump donors, including Tommy Hicks, Jr., a private-equity investor in Texas who is close to Donald Trump, Jr. (Hicks has since become the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.)“We became one big family,” Parnas said. “You got to understand, he didn’t have a real campaign, a traditional campaign. It was make-it-up, you know. Like him or not, you understand what it is. It was more, like, you know, we’d bump into each other constantly because it was all the same people, there were not that many of us.” Parnas told me that he “bumped into” Trump “plenty of times” at events in New York over the years, but that they didn’t get to know each other until the 2016 campaign. (Trump recently distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman, saying, “I don’t know those gentlemen. Now, it’s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.”)\n\nOn Election Night, Parnas, along with other donors, including the Blackwater founder Erik Prince, were invited to attend a gathering with Trump and his family. “We were all there,” he recalled. “I will never forget that.” His go-to hotel in Manhattan, Trump International Hotel & Tower, was fully booked, so he stayed at the Intercontinental, where Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, and his family were watching the results come in. “We came home laughing and celebrating at three or four in the morning,” Parnas said. “The whole Democratic Party was at the hotel. It was quiet, pitch black.”\n\nParnas said that he grew closer to Giuliani after the election. “We were good friends, he’s also my counsel,” he said. “We were looking to do business together.” When Giuliani wanted to gather information in Ukraine to counter the findings of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Parnas volunteered to help. “Because of my Ukrainian background and my contacts there, I became like Rudy’s assistant, his investigator,” he said. “I don’t do anything on my own. I don’t lobby people. I go get information. I set up a meeting. I make sure that the call went right. I make sure the translation is done right.” Parnas echoed the claims of Trump and Giuliani that the Democrats had worked with Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, ahead of the 2016 vote, seeming to imply that what he and Giuliani were doing now was little different. \n\nIn late 2018, Parnas said, he helped to connect Giuliani with the former Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was fired in 2016, by President Petro Poroshenko, after Biden and other U.S. and European officials complained that Shokin was lax in pursuing corruption. Biden, in particular, had threatened to withhold a billion dollars in loans that the Ukrainian government desperately needed. In a Skype call with Giuliani, Shokin falsely claimed that he was fired because he wanted to investigate Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, was on the board. Ukrainian and American officials said that Shokin, contrary to what he told Giuliani, did not actively investigate Burisma while he was prosecutor-general, and that the dormant cases in Ukraine that targeted Burisma—questioning how it obtained its exploration licenses and whether it paid all of its taxes—had nothing to do with Hunter’s role on the board. But Parnas said that he accepted Shokin’s claim that Biden had him fired to protect Hunter. In Parnas’s view, “Shokin basically stepped down, and allowed himself to get fired, to save the country.”\n\nParnas said that Giuliani wanted Shokin to travel to New York for a follow-up conversation. At Giuliani’s direction, Parnas spoke to Shokin about setting up his visit. “I said, ‘Listen, it’s going to be unofficial,’&nbsp;” he recalled. Shokin, who has a daughter living in California, told Parnas that he would seek a visa to visit her and would then meet Giuliani. Parnas said that Shokin was denied a visa. (Shokin did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAccording to Parnas, Giuliani helped him and Fruman get high-level meetings in Kiev, including by writing a letter of introduction to a minister in Zelensky’s government. Parnas and Fruman used the meetings to collect information that they hoped would be of interest to Trump, and to pitch energy deals for themselves. “We became a hot commodity. Past, present—everybody came with a story to tell,” Parnas recalled. “It’s like a movie, you’re hearing all these stories. You’re, like, are you kidding me?” Ukrainian officials told me that they were surprised by the indiscretion of Parnas and Fruman. A senior Ukrainian official said, of the two men, “They were looking to sell gas to Ukraine. They were looking for partners. Then, in the course of discussions, they were very open, I would say surprisingly open, about their plans to discredit Biden and to replace the Ambassador.”\n\nParnas told me that some of the Ukrainian officials and businessmen whom he met were distrustful of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who started her posting in Kiev during President Obama’s second term. Parnas said he heard that she had been “badmouthing” Trump, saying that he would soon be impeached and that Ukrainian officials shouldn’t listen to him. Parnas said that he shared this information with the former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions and with Giuliani, who lobbied the State Department and Trump to remove the Ambassador. “I had a meeting with Pete Sessions that had nothing to do with that. It was about our gas company,” Parnas said. “In the meeting, Pete asked me, ‘Do you know anything about Yovanovitch?’ I told him what I heard. Unbeknownst to me, Pete was already looking into it, and when I left he opted to write a letter to [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo that day.” (After Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Sessions said in a statement that he would “vigorously defend myself against any allegations of wrongdoing.”) \n\nThe Trump Administration abruptly recalled Yovanovitch in May. Last week, in remarks to the three committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch rebutted the rumors spread by Parnas and Fruman, saying that she served in her role “on a strictly nonpartisan basis.” She added, “Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen.”\n\nParnas, like many of the President’s most dedicated supporters, rejects the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. “It’s total bullshit,” he said. He described the Mueller investigation and the impeachment inquiry as “a modernized coup,” adding, “Before, you would use armies, guns. Now they use newspapers, television, the Internet, and media to be able to manipulate the crowd to such a point where whatever they say becomes the truth.” He ended our nearly ninety-minute meeting on a wistful note, saying that he looked forward to returning home to Florida and spending more time with his wife and son. “He’s the real story,” Parnas said, of Aaron. “My son graduated college at sixteen. He’s graduating law school at twenty. He’s about to be a lawyer. He’s doing some fascinating things. He wants to be President one day.”\n\nThe [federal indictment of Parnas and Fruman](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giulianis-two-indicted-associates-could-have-a-lot-to-say) alleges that the two and other defendants engaged in “a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates’ governments.” Since Parnas was arrested at Dulles with a one-way ticket to Vienna, it has emerged that he had been working as a translator with American lawyers representing Dmytro Firtash, one of Ukraine’s wealthiest businessmen, who has been battling extradition to the U.S. to face trial for bribery charges. Firtash has lived in Vienna for five years, but Parnas’s lawyer, John Dowd, told me that Parnas was not boarding a flight to Vienna to see Firtash when he was arrested. Dowd said that Parnas bought a one-way ticket because a round-trip fare, at the last moment, would have cost him nearly twenty thousand dollars.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rudy Giuliani","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rudy-giuliani"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hunter Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hunter-biden"},{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5a6100548bcd0613d5da686f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Entous joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering intelligence, national security, and foreign affairs.

The place was decorated with tchotchkes from the steppes and ceramic depictions of peasant life: grandmas in babushkas, farmers with sheep. On a tiled wall nearby, a blue-and-white evil eye hung on a string.\n\nOne of the men was Russian, the other Ukrainian; both were born in the disintegrating Soviet Union. Roman Khaykin, the Russian, was short and trim and bald, with a snub nose and dark eyes. Everything else about him was pale: his eyebrows were thin; his face was bloodless. He was originally from the city of Kislovodsk, whose name translates to “sour waters.” Igor Ostrovskiy, the Ukrainian, was taller and a little fat. He had curly hair that got unruly when he let it grow out. He and his family had fled to the United States in the early nineties. Ostrovskiy was curious and sometimes meddlesome. During high school, he’d suspected that several classmates were selling stolen credit-card numbers and had helped law enforcement disrupt the operation.\n\nKhaykin and Ostrovskiy spoke in accented English enlivened with Russian idioms—“*Krasavchik*!” Khaykin would often say, a word derived from “handsome” but used to praise a job well done. Both men were in the business of subterfuge and surveillance. In 2011, Ostrovskiy, a private investigator, had found himself between jobs. He’d Googled “Russian private investigators” and then cold e-mailed Khaykin, who had a company called InfoTactic, to ask for work. Khaykin liked Ostrovskiy’s chutzpah and started hiring him for surveillance jobs. They were meeting at Nargis to discuss potential work.\n\n+++\n\n***\n\n## More in the Black Cube Chronicles\n\n\n+++feature-small\n\n+++group-2\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5d9b7cc24a5528000838575a]|||\n[Published on October 8, 2019](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-espionage/the-black-cube-chronicles-the-undercover-operative).\n|||\n\n\n\n[#image: /photos/5d9b7cc3d3598d000863f8ea]|||\n[Published on October 9, 2019](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-espionage/the-black-cube-chronicles-the-double-agent).\n|||\n\n+++\n\nAs plates of kebab arrived, Khaykin explained that he’d started working as a subcontractor for a new client, a firm that he wouldn’t name but that was bringing in big business. “I’m into some cool shit,” Khaykin said. “Some dark stuff.” He’d adopted some new tactics, too. He could get bank records and unauthorized credit reports. He had ways of tracking a phone’s geolocation data. He said that the phone high jinks usually cost a few thousand dollars, with cheaper options for gullible marks and more expensive ones for those who proved elusive. Khaykin said that he’d already used the tracking method successfully, for a case in which one family member had hired him to find another.\n\nOstrovskiy assumed that Khaykin was exaggerating. But he needed work. And Khaykin, it turned out, needed more manpower to serve his new patron.\n\nIn October of 2016, as reporters circled allegations of sexual assault and harassment against the film producer Harvey Weinstein, Weinstein and his lawyers hired Black Cube, an Israeli private-intelligence agency. At first, according to sources close to the Black Cube operation, the agency believed that it had been hired to counter a negative campaign against Weinstein, and expected that the work would concentrate on his business rivals. But the agency soon began to receive assignments to spy on women with sexual-harassment and assault accusations against Weinstein, and on reporters investigating those accusations. Black Cube, whose staff included former members of Mossad and other Israeli intelligence and military agencies, specialized in deception, including the use of front companies and operatives with false identities. (Weinstein has denied “any allegations of non-consensual sex.”)\n\nHiring the agency was only a part of Weinstein’s larger effort to prevent the disclosure of the sexual-abuse claims. He also hired the private-investigation firm co-founded by Jack Palladino, who was best known for working to undermine women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. As a part of its work for Weinstein, Palladino’s firm created dossiers on both journalists and accusers. Under the guise of assembling research for a book about his company, Weinstein also hired some of his former employees to compile lists of targets and then contact the people on those lists. The lists included reporters at *The* *New Yorker*, the *Times*, and *New York* magazine; the actresses Rose McGowan, Rosanna Arquette, and Annabella Sciorra; and secondary sources who might be able to confirm those women’s stories.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5d9ce9e15e97bb00088c9c99]||||||\n\n+++\n\nBut Black Cube played the largest role in Weinstein’s efforts to suppress the stories. Weinstein shared the lists of targets with the Israeli agency, which forwarded them to a network of operatives around the world. *The New Yorker* [previously reported](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies) that those operatives included a journalist whom the agency hired and a dedicated spy who posed under multiple false identities to gain access to journalists and accusers. Black Cube also hired Khaykin and Ostrovskiy, as subcontractors, and asked them to surveil people on the target lists. I wrote a [series](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories) [of pieces](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/weighing-the-costs-of-speaking-out-about-harvey-weinstein) [on Weinstein](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies) [and his enablers](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-secret-settlements) in the fall of 2017. During the time that I was reporting the [first of those stories](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories), Khaykin and Ostrovskiy staked out my apartment building and tailed me to the offices of NBC, where I worked as a correspondent, and later to the offices of *The New Yorker*. At one point, Khaykin claimed to have successfully used my cell phone to track my location. (A source close to the Black Cube operation said that the agency was unaware of, and did not authorize, the cell-phone tracking.) The two men also performed counter-surveillance, making sure that Black Cube operatives weren’t followed to meetings, which often took place in hotel lobbies or upscale restaurants in Manhattan. At those meetings, Ostrovskiy would order meals—a perk of the job—while discreetly eavesdropping and recording the encounters. Some of the meetings he monitored were unrelated to Weinstein and concerned far-flung locations, including Cyprus, Luxembourg, and Russia. For Ostrovskiy, much of the work was shrouded in mystery; the layers of command meant that he didn’t know why he was following his targets, or for whom.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nOstrovskiy had spent most of his career as a private investigator on more mundane jobs—digging up dirt for custody cases, uncovering evidence of insurance fraud, or spying on cheating spouses. The early months of 2017, after he resumed working for Khaykin, were dominated by these kinds of assignments, for which he was paid thirty-five dollars an hour, plus expenses. That summer, however, Khaykin began giving Ostrovskiy assignments that came from the anonymous new client. Khaykin said little about these jobs. Sometimes he would send screenshots of documents that featured the addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, and biographical information of targets. Often, the screenshots included information on spouses and other family members. Although Ostrovskiy didn’t know it, the information was pulled from dossiers that Black Cube had compiled for Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn the summer of 2017, as I was speaking to Weinstein’s accusers and colleagues, Ostrovskiy and Khaykin began meeting at dawn near my apartment building, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Some days, they would stay in Khaykin’s car, a silver Nissan Pathfinder. Other times, the two would use separate cars. Khaykin would be ready to follow me if I left the building, and Ostrovskiy would keep an eye on my apartment. When separated, they stayed in touch by text.\n\nThe investigators had been given photos of me and had done database searches of their own. They monitored my social-media accounts and those of my friends and relatives, trying to track my movements. The pair sat in front of my building, chain-smoking and getting bagels from a restaurant around the corner. The surveillance often dragged on for hours, and there were few opportunities for bathroom breaks. “I need to use a bottle,” Ostrovskiy once texted Khaykin. “If you nearby I can wait.” He resigned himself to using the bottle.\n\nKhaykin and Ostrovskiy sometimes disagreed about how best to conduct the surveillance, bickering in their texts and calls. Under the impression that I was on the “Today” show one morning, and assuming that I would be at Rockefeller Center, where the show tapes, Khaykin wrote to Ostrovskiy, “Is it worth going? To see if we get him coming out?”\n\n“It’s a really busy area, Rockefeller Center,” Ostrovskiy replied. “We don’t have enough people to cover all the entrances and exits.”\n\nAt times, the investigators were hapless. One day, Ostrovskiy and Khaykin spotted one of my neighbors, to whom I bore a passing resemblance, coming out of my apartment building. They gave chase. Ostrovskiy followed by car, filming on a Panasonic camcorder, and Khaykin pursued on foot. On a later day, when Ostrovskiy was alone on duty, he followed the same man again, drawing near enough to touch him. Sensing that something was wrong, Ostrovskiy dialled my number.\n\nUpstairs, in my apartment, I picked up a call from a number I didn’t recognize. “Hello?” I said, and heard a brief exclamation in Russian before the line went dead. I put down the phone confused and unnerved. Downstairs, my neighbor walked on, unaware that Ostrovskiy had been following him.\n\n“Seems like no march,” Ostrovskiy texted Khaykin. “Back at residence now.” In his car, he searched Google for better photos of me and made light of the mistake. “Found a good ID pic,” he wrote, and sent his boss a picture of me and my sister Dylan, at around ages four and six, in our parents’ arms. “Going off this one we should be good.”\n\n“Lol,” Khaykin replied. Later, as if to make sure that Ostrovskiy was kidding, Khaykin sent a screenshot from one of the dossiers, showing my birthday.\n\nI wasn’t the only one Ostrovskiy and Khaykin were following; they also billed a few hours trailing Jodi Kantor, a reporter from the *Times*, who was also working on a story about Weinstein, on one occasion taking photographs of her as she commuted to work on the subway.\n\nOne morning in August of 2017, Khaykin called Ostrovskiy and told him that they would be relying on a new surveillance tactic: they would use my cell phone. Ostrovskiy thought of Khaykin’s boast, the previous fall, that he had the means to obtain a phone’s geolocation data. Shortly after noon that day, Khaykin started sending Ostrovskiy screenshots of maps, marked with pin-drops indicating the latitude, longitude, and elevation of a moving target. Khaykin seemed to have found a way to track my phone.\n\n“It’s the area near World Trade Center,” Ostrovskiy wrote to Khaykin, after receiving the maps. “Heading there now.” And then, “Any additional info where to expect him to come out from?”\n\n“No data,” Khaykin replied.\n\n“Ok will look around,” Ostrovskiy wrote.\n\nThe information that Khaykin sent to Ostrovskiy was correct. That day, I was at the World Trade Center for my first meeting with David Remnick, the editor of *The* *New Yorker*, to discuss the reporting on Weinstein that the magazine would eventually publish. I was on edge. In the preceding weeks, I’d begun to suspect that I was being followed. My building superintendent had told me that he’d seen men lurking outside. Sources had advised me to get a gun and move out of my apartment.\n\nThe day of that meeting, hundreds of text messages flooded my phone. “(Survey) Should Trump be impeached?” they said, one after another. “Reply to cast your vote. To unsubscribe from our list&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Each came from a different number. I swiped away the texts, then finally gave up and responded to opt out, which seemed not to help. In the same time frame, unbeknownst to me, Khaykin was sending Ostrovskiy the maps accurately pinpointing my location.\n\nI left the meeting at *The New Yorker* feeling anxious. Suspecting that I’d been followed on the subway in the past, I decided to hail a cab. As I made my way uptown, I went right by Khaykin and Ostrovskiy, who were waiting near *The New Yorker’s* office, hoping to intercept me.\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nIn October and November of 2017, *The New Yorker* published the stories on Weinstein’s alleged predation. One of those stories revealed that Weinstein had hired Black Cube to surveil me, Kantor, and other reporters who were investigating him. But it wasn’t until the summer of 2018 that I learned that Black Cube had hired Khaykin and Ostrovskiy. That July, I posted a picture on social media of a frying pan marketed under the brand Black Cube. I jokingly wrote, “Scratch resistant. May use false identities and shell companies to extract information.”\n\nA few weeks later, I got a call on my cell phone. The caller I.D. read “Axiom.” Soon after, I got a text: “I am trying to reach you directly and privately. It’s regarding a Fry Pan that’s Scratch Resistant. Sometimes I cook and the black coating scares me.”\n\nI wrote back, “Can you say more about who you are?”\n\n“I can say I do surveillance,” came the reply. “We will need to meet discreetly and make sure we are not followed.”\n\nA few days later, I was waiting at a Brazilian restaurant in the theatre district to meet the new source. My phone rang with an encrypted Signal call. “Axiom” appeared on the screen again and I answered.\n\n“Don’t order,” a man’s voice said. I looked around but couldn’t see anyone. “You are wearing the messenger bag, light-blue shirt, and slightly darker jeans,” the man said. He told me to leave the restaurant and then walk slowly, adding, “Walk against traffic, please.”\n\nOutside, I craned my neck to look behind me. “Don’t look around,” the man told me, sounding a little annoyed. He directed me through a combination of calls and texts: “I’ll be about a half a block away, so please stop for 1–1\\.5 minutes at the intersections. I’m going to make sure no same people show up there from here. Don’t look, just walk naturally. Against traffic.” He told me to stop at a basement Peruvian restaurant that had no cell reception. “Ask for a table in the back, all the way in the back,” he said. I did as he asked. Ten minutes later, a man sat down across from me. His hair was dark and curly, and he was a little soft around the middle. He had a thick Ukrainian accent.\n\n“I’m a concerned party,” Ostrovskiy told me. He slid a phone across the table and motioned for me to swipe through the pictures on it. There was my block, my front door, my superintendent. And there was the Nissan, with two men inside: Ostrovskiy, dark and chubby, and Khaykin, pale and bald. Ostrovskiy told me that they were part of a local private-investigation firm, licensed in New York. “But the work product, the final reports, Black Cube was putting their name on it,” he said. Ostrovskiy had read the article I’d written about Black Cube and recognized the description of the target list. He had sent the story to Khaykin and then confronted him about it during a stakeout. Khaykin had seemed irritated but eventually said, “Now you know who we work for.” (A source close to the Black Cube operation said that InfoTactic was only one “piece of the puzzle” in the firm’s operations, and that it was common practice to use locally licensed investigators for surveillance and counter-surveillance.) \n\nOstrovskiy told me that the more run-of-the-mill investigative work he did “might not be ethical, but it’s legitimate.” He said that he felt differently about the work for Black Cube. “I fear that it may be illegal,” he told me. Ostrovskiy described the various efforts to track me, in person and through my phone. He said that he had objections to the tactics that had been used against me. And it wasn’t just me; although the Weinstein operation was over, Ostrovskiy was still following people for Black Cube, and he was hoping to learn why.\n\nHe read me a list of surveillance targets and the dates and times of each assignment. Most of the meetings had taken place at upscale hotel restaurants, where Ostrovskiy had monitored meetings between Black Cube agents and marks who appeared to be experts in technology and cybercrime, particularly in new tools for hacking and monitoring cell phones. Ostrovskiy said that the information he was given in each case was limited and “designed to be traceable back to me.” He was anxious that he was being watched and that Black Cube would learn that we were meeting. He had swept the area around the restaurant before entering.\n\nI was also becoming more careful: I’d asked a colleague to follow a few blocks behind me and keep an eye on the restaurant while the meeting took place. Ostrovskiy and I left the Peruvian restaurant separately, ten minutes apart. A short time later, my colleague called. A man had apparently followed Ostrovskiy and me to the restaurant, waited outside as we entered, and then lingered by the door for more than an hour.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nAt first, Ostrovskiy wouldn’t give me the name of his boss. But there were enough clues in the pictures to help me figure out his identity. When I Googled the name that I’d come up with, I found a promotional video. “I’m the guy out in the field. The action-taker,” a bald man with a Russian accent said in the video. “My name is Roman Khaykin, and I’m the founder of InfoTactic Group.”\n\nA techno beat played. Over footage of buttonhole cameras, a narrator promised clients “the best high-tech surveillance equipment.” Khaykin, doing his best impression of James Bond or Ethan Hunt, darted athletically through crowds. It was beguilingly cheesy. “When I was young and first learned how to read,” Khaykin said, “I would fascinate my parents with my ability to memorize the text of my favorite book—Sherlock Holmes.” (Khaykin declined repeated requests for comment. His attorney initially confirmed details presented to him in a fact-checking call, but then suggested that the information was false, without offering specifics.) \n\nIn the months that followed, Ostrovskiy kept passing along tips about InfoTactic’s operations for Black Cube, and about the meetings between Black Cube agents and technology experts. Sometimes I’d go watch the meetings unfold from afar. Ostrovskiy and I would meet, too, at hole-in-the-wall restaurants—though on some occasions we would leave immediately and carry out our conversations while walking along side streets. Once, Ostrovskiy and I sat in the corner of a hotel lobby and spoke for half an hour before he abruptly excused himself. He came back worried, saying that we had to move—he suspected that two men sitting nearby were following us. They looked like professionals, and they’d been watching us too closely. We took a cab, and then another cab; Ostrovskiy asked one driver to pull over on the shoulder of the West Side Highway and wait for any potential tails to either go by or identify themselves by slowing down.\n\nAt one point, Ostrovskiy told me that Black Cube had asked Khaykin to find a spy pen capable of secretly recording audio, and he showed me a picture of the pen that they’d procured. It was black, with a silver clip—nothing you’d notice if you weren’t looking closely, but with a few distinctive features, including a narrow ring of chrome on its barrel.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nIn January of 2019, not long after Ostrovskiy had told me about the spy pen, his work for Black Cube went awry. He was asked to tail a lunch meeting between a Black Cube agent and John Scott-Railton, a researcher for the watchdog group Citizen Lab. The Black Cube agent, a middle-aged man with a neat white beard, was pretending to be a man named Michel Lambert and had told Scott-Railton that he worked for a Paris-based agricultural-technology firm called CPW-Consulting. The operative claimed that he wanted to meet about Scott-Railton’s doctoral research on using kite-mounted cameras to create maps.\n\nAs the lunch progressed, the agent tried to get Scott-Railton to talk about Citizen Lab, which tracks state-backed efforts to hack and surveil journalists. The group had recently reported that software developed by an Israeli cyber-intelligence company called NSO Group had been used to hack the iPhone of a friend of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shortly before Saudi operatives murdered Khashoggi. The revelation had sparked harsh public criticism of NSO Group, which denied that its software was used to target Khashoggi but which also declined to say whether it had sold the software to the Saudi government. At the lunch, the Black Cube operative started asking about Citizen Lab’s reporting on NSO Group. He asked whether there was a “racist element” to Citizen Lab’s focus on an Israeli company. He pressed Scott-Railton for his views on the Holocaust. As they spoke, he took out a black pen with a silver clip and a chrome ring on its barrel. He laid it down on a legal pad in front of him, with the tip pointed at Scott-Railton. From a table nearby, Ostrovskiy was watching the meeting and taking photographs. \n\nBut Scott-Railton, who had found the request for the meeting suspicious, had been taping the Black Cube agent the entire time—and he’d brought his own backup. Raphael Satter, an Associated Press journalist with whom Scott-Railton had been working, was at another table, with a cameraman, who started filming the encounter. Satter then confronted the Black Cube agent, whose cover had been blown. Ostrovskiy soon got a call from Khaykin. “Our guy got burned!” Khaykin said. “Get to the lobby immediately! He needs to get out.”\n\nThe Black Cube agent hid in a back room, then ducked out of a service entrance while Ostrovskiy retrieved his car. Ostrovskiy picked up the agent and his luggage and then drove around, trying to shake potential tails. The agent frantically made calls, trying to book the first flight out of New York. Ostrovskiy noticed a tag on his luggage with the name Almog and a home address in Israel on it. The agent had been sloppy. The name was real. He was a retired Israeli security official named Aharon Almog-Assouline, who was later reported to have been involved in a string of Black Cube operations.\n\nBlack Cube and NSO Group would later deny any connection to the operation against Citizen Lab. But Almog-Assouline had been at many of the meetings that Ostrovskiy had described to me in the preceding months, which appeared to target figures who had criticized NSO Group or argued that its software was being used to hunt journalists.\n\nBlack Cube’s leadership was furious about the botched operation and ordered everyone who knew about it to take a polygraph immediately. Ostrovskiy called me, worried that it was only a matter of time until he was exposed. He wanted to talk, and not just to a reporter. He had already tried to contact the F.B.I., only to be passed between skeptical agents, one of whom had hung up on him. He asked if I had a better contact in law enforcement, and I sent him the name of an official at the Southern District of New York. Soon after our call, Ostrovskiy hired a whistle-blower attorney and began the process of volunteering to be a witness.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nEarlier this year, Ostrovskiy and I reunited, at a French bistro on the Upper West Side. Ostrovskiy looked as if he hadn’t slept in days. I asked him why he had decided to contact me, and, later, law enforcement. “I like to be able to read the news and not think somebody’s holding a gun to a reporter’s head, deciding what he writes,” he told me. “Coming from a society where the news was controlled by those in power, I never, ever want to allow this to happen to the country that gave me and my wife and my son a chance.”\n\nOstrovskiy and his wife had just had a baby boy, a first-generation American. “I happened to be at this intersection where we were following reporters whose stories I read, who I thought were doing something honest and good,” Ostrovskiy said. “If somebody wants to attack that, that’s attacking my country. That’s attacking my home.”\n\nHe told me that, after he’d refused to take the polygraph test for Black Cube, InfoTactic had stopped sending him jobs. Now he was starting his own firm: Ostro Intelligence. He’d still be a private investigator, but there would be a public-service angle to his work. Maybe he could help groups like Citizen Lab. “Moving forward, I’m going to try to be more involved with this kind of stuff, to better society,” he said.\n\nHe showed me a few pictures of his family on his phone: his wife, looking flushed and exhausted after birth. His infant son. A blue-gray cat with clever, lamp-like eyes, looking at the new arrival. The cat’s name was Spy.\n\n*This excerpt is drawn from “[Catch and Kill](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316486639/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vamf_taft_p1_i0),” by Ronan Farrow, out this month from Little, Brown and Company.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7f2710c62d10815419","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Harvey Weinstein","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"harvey-weinstein"},{"id":"5c2e1e22ee7fe02cbd1634dc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ronan Farrow","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ronan-farrow"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92710c62d10815483","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Private Investigators","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"private-investigators"},{"id":"5c2e1ca07e716b454591add9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Espionage","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"espionage"},{"id":"5c2e1d86397f5b30646d0716","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Surveillance","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"surveillance"}],"sections":[{"id":"5d977a9c9673ad00081d8d4a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Espionage","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-espionage"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59dcc2c0575c4663a2eeed30","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ronan Farrow is an investigative reporter and a contributing writer to *The New Yorker*.

Some candidates’ memoirs tell stories of humble beginnings and of obstacles overcome; some describe searches for identity; some earnestly set out detailed policy agendas. Nearly all are relentlessly bland. In 2017, [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), a longtime senator from Delaware, [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama)’s Vice-President for eight years, and now a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, published an unusually raw memoir about the death, two years earlier, of his forty-six-year-old son, Beau, describing how it had threatened to undo him but ultimately brought his family closer. Beau, his father writes, was “Joe Biden 2.0,” a war veteran, a prosecutor, and a promising politician who “had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.”\n\nIn the early months of the 2020 race, Joe Biden holds a lead over his many Democratic Party rivals, but he is hardly invulnerable. He is seventy-six and sometimes shows it. He often stumbles when defending his five-decade public history. Some voters will not easily overlook his support for the Iraq War, his treatment of Anita Hill and loose management of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, his handsy, close-talking behavior with women, or his descriptions of his “civil” working relationships with segregationist lawmakers. Even his admirers concede that he is prone to senatorial bloviation. What often seems to redeem him with voters, as a former senior White House aide put it recently, is “how he’s responded to tragedy and what he’s learned from it.”\n\nYet the family story that Biden tells in “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose” largely glosses over a central character in Biden’s life. Biden writes, “I was pretty sure Beau could run for President some day, and, with his brother’s help, he could win.” Hunter Biden, who is forty-nine, is described as a supportive son and sibling. In speeches, Biden rarely talks about Hunter. But news outlets on the right and mainstream media organizations, including the _Times_, have homed in on him, reprising old controversies over Hunter’s work for a bank, for a lobbying firm, and for a hedge fund, and scrutinizing his business dealings in China and Ukraine.\n\nThere is little question that Hunter’s proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former aide told me, “Hunter is super rich terrain.” But [Donald J. Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Biden’s candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice-President to advance and protect his son’s interests.\n\nAt the same time, the gossip pages have seized on Hunter’s tumultuous private life. He has struggled for decades with alcohol addiction and drug abuse; he went through an acrimonious divorce from his first wife, Kathleen Buhle Biden; and he had a subsequent relationship with Beau’s widow, Hallie. He was recently sued for child support by an Arkansas woman, Lunden Alexis Roberts, who claims that he is the father of her child. (Hunter has denied having sexual relations with Roberts.)\n\nOn May 17th, the day before Hunter planned to appear at one of his father’s rallies, at Eakins Oval, in Philadelphia, [Breitbart News](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-is-steve-bannon-without-breitbart) published a story based on a Prescott, Arizona, police report from 2016 that named Hunter as the suspect in a possible narcotics offense.\n\nOnstage at the rally, Jill Biden introduced her husband. “The Biden family is ready,” she said. “We will do this as we always have—as a family.” Seated in white chairs to the side of the stage were Ashley Biden, Hunter’s half sister; Ashley’s husband, Howard Krein; Beau’s children, Natalie and Robert Hunter; Hunter’s three daughters, Maisy, Finnegan, and Naomi; and Naomi’s boyfriend, Peter. The last seat in the row, with a piece of paper on it that said “Reserved,” remained empty.\n\nIn one of my early conversations with Hunter, he told me about his sadness at having missed his father’s event. “Beau and I have been there since we were carried in baskets during his first campaign,” he said. “We went everywhere with him. At every single major event and every small event that had to do with his political career, I was there. I’ve never missed a rally for my dad. The notion that I’m not standing next to him in Philadelphia, next to the Rocky statue, it’s heartbreaking for me. It’s killing me and it’s killing him. Dad says, ‘Be here.’ Mom says, ‘Be here.’ But at what cost?”\n\nHunter speaks in the warm, circuitous style of his father. Through weeks of conversations, he became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on “Hannity.” He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. “Look, everybody faces pain,” he said. “Everybody has trauma. There’s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel—it’s a never-ending tunnel. You don’t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter Biden was born in 1970, a year and a day after Beau and a year and nine months before their sister, Naomi. His father was twenty-seven, and won his first election, to the New Castle County Council, in November of that year. Two years later, in an immense leap of ambition, he decided to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden pledged that, in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, he would never own a stock or a bond. Whatever money he had, he spent on property. His father, Joseph Biden, Sr., managed a Chevrolet dealership in Wilmington, and Joe grew up in a house with his parents, his three siblings, his aunt Gertie, and two uncles. He tried to re-create this arrangement for his own family. He liked historic houses, and bought a center-hall Colonial, built in 1723, on a four-acre lot in the village of North Star, about thirty minutes west of Wilmington. “The large houses were a way for all of us, including aunts and uncles, to have something special,” Hunter said.\n\nJoe Biden depended on his family to help staff his campaigns. His sister, Valerie, who taught at the Quaker day school Wilmington Friends, served as his campaign manager. His brother Jimmy oversaw fund-raising; Frankie, the youngest, helped organize volunteers. When the children were babies, Biden’s wife, Neilia, carried them to community meetings. In November, 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate.\n\nThat December, while Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office, Neilia took the children to Wilmington, to go Christmas-tree shopping. At an intersection, the family car collided with a truck. Neilia and Naomi were killed almost instantly. Beau sustained numerous broken bones, and Hunter suffered a severe head injury. Hunter has frequently said that his first memory is of waking up in a hospital bed next to Beau, who turned to him and said, “I love you, I love you, I love you.” On January 5, 1973, Biden was sworn in as a senator in his sons’ hospital room.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a0a795e00084262e1]||||||\n+++\n\nValerie and Jimmy devoted themselves to the boys’ recovery while Biden took up his role in the Senate. In 1975, he sold the North Star property, and the family moved into a house in Wilmington that had once been owned by members of the du Pont family. Biden, on returning from Washington, often put on a hazmat suit and went into the basement to scrape asbestos off the pipes. He, Hunter, and Beau planted trees and painted the house. Hunter told me that his father would dangle him upside down from the third-floor windows so that he could reach the eaves with a brush. So many people came and went that Tommy Lewis, an old friend of Biden’s who became one of his Senate aides, nicknamed the house the Station. Hunter recalled, “No door was ever locked. The pool was everyone’s pool.” He and Beau were “communal property,” he said. “Everyone had a hand in raising us.” In 1977, Joe Biden married Jill Jacobs, a high-school teacher. (Hunter calls Jill “Mom” and refers to Neilia as “Mommy.”)\n\nBiden frequently took the boys to Washington with him when Congress was in session. Roger Harrison, who worked in Biden’s office for seven years, recalled that one of them often sat on Biden’s lap during staff meetings. If he was busy on the Senate floor, another senator would take Hunter and Beau to his office to hang out. Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the boys would wander over to the Senate gym and sit in a corner of the steam room, eavesdropping on lawmakers.\n\nBeau and Hunter were fiercely close. They attended Archmere Academy, the Catholic high school that was their father’s alma mater. Friends called Beau, a stickler for rules, the Sheriff. Hunter told me, “If we wanted to jump off a cliff into a watering hole, I would say, ‘I’m ready, let’s go,’ and Beau would say, ‘Wait, wait, wait, before we do it, make sure there aren’t any rocks down there.’ ” Brian McGlinchey, a friend of Hunter’s who attended Archmere with the brothers, said, “Beau tended to lead with his head. Hunter often led with his heart.” At Archmere, Beau, with the help of Hunter, who distributed flyers, was elected student-body president. It was clear to family and friends that Beau would follow his father into politics. “Dad knew that is what Beau wanted,” Hunter said.\n\nBiden sold off some of the land at the Station to help pay for Beau to go to the University of Pennsylvania, in 1987\\. That year, Hunter and Beau encouraged their father to run for President, and they were crushed when he withdrew from the race over allegations of plagiarism. (He was accused of copying large portions of a law-review article as a student, and of mimicking a speech given by the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.) Soon afterward, when Biden took his sons to a football game at the University of Pennsylvania, a group of hecklers started a chant about the plagiarism scandal. Hunter jumped to his feet, throwing punches, and his father and Beau had to pull him back.\n\nHunter enrolled at Georgetown University in 1988\\. He and Beau took out student loans to cover their university costs. Hunter worked odd jobs—parking cars at events and unloading sixty-pound boxes of frozen beef—to help pay for his room and board. Ted Dziak, a chaplain-in-residence in Hunter’s freshman dorm, told me, “Hunter was always out there, doing something to gain a little bit of money.”\n\nIn July, 1992, after graduating with a B.A. in history, Hunter began a year as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon. During that time, he met Kathleen Buhle, the daughter of a Chicago schoolteacher and a ticket salesman for the White Sox. Three months after they started dating, Kathleen got pregnant, and the two were married in July, 1993.\n\nBeau attended Syracuse Law School, and began thinking about government service. Hunter imagined a more artistic career for himself. He admired Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff; his favorite novel at the time was Charles Bukowski’s début, “Post Office.” On a whim, he applied to, and was accepted into, the creative-writing program at Syracuse University, where Carver and Wolff had taught. He considered getting a joint M.F.A.-law degree at Syracuse, but, with a baby on the way, he decided to go straight to law school. He was rejected from Yale, his first choice, and enrolled at Georgetown Law. In December, 1993, his daughter Naomi was born.\n\nAfter a year at Georgetown, Hunter transferred to Yale Law, where he completed his degree, in 1996\\. Then he returned to Wilmington with Kathleen and Naomi. Joe Biden was running for reëlection in the Senate, and he appointed Hunter as his deputy campaign manager. Hunter rented an apartment close to his father’s campaign headquarters, and also got a job as a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company based in Delaware, which was one of the largest donors to his father’s campaigns. At the age of twenty-six, Hunter, who was earning more than a hundred thousand dollars and had received a signing bonus, was making nearly as much money as his father. In January, 1998, the conservative reporter and columnist Byron York wrote, in _The American Spectator_, “Certainly lots of children of influential parents end up in very good jobs. But the Biden case is troubling. After all, this is a senator who for years has sermonized against what he says is the corrupting influence of money in politics.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter shared his father’s love of old houses. In 1997, he bought a dilapidated estate in Wilmington, the original structure of which dated to before the Revolutionary War. The previous owner, Anna Sasso, recalled, “They seemed like the perfect family. They were teen-agers, practically. They were so enthusiastic.” That year, Beau started working as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s office in Philadelphia, and moved in with his brother’s family, taking over the third floor. Hunter was responsible for the mortgage and most of the expenses. In September, 1998, Hunter and Kathleen had their second daughter, Finnegan. On weekends, the house was a gathering place for friends, including a local woman named Hallie Olivere, whose parents owned a dry-cleaning business. Beau and Hallie married in 2002.\n\nHunter, by then an executive vice-president at MBNA, found the corporate culture stifling. “If you forgot to wear your MBNA lapel pin, someone would stop you in the halls,” he recalled. In 1998, he contacted William Oldaker, a Washington lawyer who had worked on his father’s Presidential campaign in 1987, for advice about how to get a job in the Clinton Administration. Oldaker called William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, who had also worked on Biden’s campaign. Daley, the son of the five-term mayor of Chicago, told me that, because of their shared experience growing up in political families, he empathized with Hunter, and asked his staff to evaluate him for a position as a policy director specializing in the burgeoning Internet economy. Hunter got the job, then sold the Delaware house for roughly twice what he’d paid for it and moved his family to a rental home in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. Hunter and Kathleen sent Naomi and Finnegan—and later Maisy, who was born in 2000—to Sidwell Friends, one of Washington’s most exclusive and expensive schools. Hunter’s salary barely covered the rent, the school fees, and his family’s living expenses. “I’ve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck,” Hunter told me. “I never considered it struggling, but it has always been a high-wire act.”\n\nIn late 2000, near the end of President Clinton’s second term, Hunter again consulted Oldaker, who was starting a lobbying business, the National Group. Oldaker asked the co-founder of the firm, Vincent Versage, to teach Hunter the basics of earmarking—the practice of persuading lawmakers to insert language into legislation which directs taxpayer funds to projects that benefit the lobbyist’s clients. In 2001, Robert Skomorucha, an old Biden family friend who worked in the government-and-community-relations department at St. Joseph’s University, proposed that Hunter solicit earmarks for one of the university’s student-volunteer programs, at an underprivileged high school in Philadelphia. Timothy Lannon, the university’s president, who offered Hunter the contract, described Hunter to me as “like his dad: great personally, very engaging, very curious about things and hardworking,” adding that he had “a very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.”\n\nVersage told me that the National Group had a strict rule: “Hunter didn’t do anything that involved his dad, didn’t do anything that involved any help from his dad.” Oldaker advised Hunter to restrict his clients to mostly Jesuit universities. “He wasn’t doing McDonnell Douglas or something,” Oldaker told me. Still, Hunter’s name appeared regularly in newspaper stories decrying the cozy relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. An informal arrangement was established: Biden wouldn’t ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn’t tell his father about them. “It wasn’t like we all sat down and agreed on it,” Hunter told me. “It came naturally.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOldaker’s office was across the street from the Bombay Club, an Indian restaurant that was popular with policymakers, lobbyists, diplomats, and journalists. The lounge there became an after-hours gathering place for Hunter, Versage, and a dozen of their colleagues. Irfan Ozarslan, the former general manager, said that he greeted Hunter at the door “at least three or four times a week.” The bartender at the time, Norman, told me that he would have a cigarette waiting for Hunter at his seat.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d4]||||||\n+++\n\nJoe Biden grew up around relatives with alcohol problems, and at a young age he decided to abstain. Hunter—who spoke frankly to me about his struggles with addiction—started drinking socially as a teen-ager. When he was a student at Georgetown, in the early nineties, he took up smoking Marlboro Red cigarettes, and occasionally used cocaine. Once, hoping to buy cocaine, he was sold a piece of crack, but he wasn’t sure how to take the drug. “I didn’t have a stem,” Hunter said. “I didn’t have a pipe.” Improvising, he stuffed the crack into a cigarette and smoked it. “It didn’t have much of an effect,” he said.\n\nIn 2001, Hunter, Kathleen, and their children moved back to Wilmington to be closer to the rest of the Biden family, and Hunter commuted to Washington on Amtrak, as his father did. Sometimes he missed the last train and stayed in a rental room at the Army and Navy Club. “When I found myself making the decision to have another drink or get on a train, I knew I had a problem,” he said. In 2003, Kathleen and the girls returned to Washington. Hunter recalled that Kathleen told him to get sober, starting by not drinking for thirty days. “And I wouldn’t drink for thirty days, but, on day thirty-one, I’d be right back to it,” he said. That September, on a business trip, he looked up rehabilitation centers, and soon admitted himself to Crossroads Centre Antigua for a month. The day after his return, Beau accompanied him to his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, in Dupont Circle.\n\nBy the mid-two-thousands, a growing number of lawmakers were criticizing earmarking as a waste of taxpayer money and a boon to special interests. Hunter was concerned about his future as a lobbyist, and his financial worries increased in 2006, when he bought a $1.6-million house in an affluent neighborhood. Without the savings for a down payment, he took out a mortgage for a hundred and ten per cent of the purchase price.\n\nIn 2006, Hunter and his uncle Jimmy Biden, along with another partner, entered into a twenty-one-million-dollar deal to buy Paradigm, a hedge-fund group that claimed to manage $1.5 billion in assets. Hunter said that the deal sounded “super attractive,” but that it fell apart after he and Jimmy learned that the company was worth less than they thought, and that the lawyer they were working with was a convicted felon awaiting sentencing. Hunter and Jimmy, who together went on to buy a stake in the company, estimated that they lost at least $1.3 million on the initial venture, which Hunter described as “a tragicomedy.” To help repay a law firm that had put up the money to initiate the transaction, Hunter obtained a million-dollar note against his house from Washington First Bank, which was co-founded by Oldaker. On January 5, 2007, two days before Biden announced his decision to run for President, Hunter and Jimmy were sued by their former partner in New York. The suit was settled but resulted in a flurry of headlines.\n\nIn the lead-up to the January, 2008, Iowa Democratic Presidential caucuses, Hunter drove from Washington to Des Moines to campaign with his father. “I’m like his security blanket,” Hunter said. “I don’t tell the staff what to do. I’m not there giving directions or orders. I shake everybody’s hands. And then I tell him to close his eyes on the bus. I can say things to him that nobody else can.” Biden did poorly in Iowa, and soon dropped out of the race. On August 23, 2008, Obama, the Democratic nominee, publicly introduced Biden as his running mate. He praised Beau, who had recently become Delaware’s attorney general and was getting ready to deploy to Iraq with his National Guard unit.\n\nHunter had heard that, during the primaries, some of Obama’s advisers had criticized him to reporters for his earmarking work. Hunter said that he wasn’t told by members of the Obama campaign to end his lobbying activities, but that he knew “the writing was on the wall.” Hunter told his lobbying clients that he would no longer represent them, and resigned from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak, a role for which, Hunter said, the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid had tapped him. “I wanted my father to have a clean slate,” Hunter told me. “I didn’t want to limit him in any way.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn September, 2008, Hunter launched a boutique consulting firm, Seneca Global Advisors, named for the largest of the Finger Lakes, in New York State, where his mother had grown up. In pitch meetings with prospective clients, Hunter said that he could help small and mid-sized companies expand into markets in the U.S. and other countries. In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator [John Kerry](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-kerry)’s stepson and an heir to the food-company fortune, and Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model who started his finance career at Citibank in Asia and who had been friends with Heinz at Yale. (Heinz and Archer already had a private-equity fund called Rosemont Capital.) Heinz believed that Hunter would share his aversion to entering into business deals that could attract public scrutiny, but over time Hunter and Archer seized opportunities that did not include Heinz, who was less inclined to take risks.\n\nIn 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital—and, potentially, capital from other countries—in companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House.\n\nIn December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President [Xi Jinping](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/xi-jinping). Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation’s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn’t understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. “How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” he said.\n\nHunter’s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Biden’s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father’s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter’s behavior invited questions about whether he “was leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasn’t done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.” When I asked members of Biden’s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. “Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,” a former adviser told me. Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, “got deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. It’s like you’ve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.”\n\nFor another venture, Archer travelled to Kiev to pitch investors on a real-estate fund he managed, Rosemont Realty. There, he met Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, one of Ukraine’s largest natural-gas producers. Zlochevsky had served as ecology minister under the pro-Russian government of [Viktor Yanukovych](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-trump-russia-investigation-and-the-mafia-state). After public protests in 2013 and early 2014, the Ukrainian parliament had voted to remove Yanukovych and called for his arrest. Under the new Ukrainian government, authorities in Kiev, with the encouragement of the Obama Administration, launched an investigation into whether Zlochevsky had used his cabinet position to grant exploration licenses that benefitted Burisma. (The status of the inquiry is unclear, but no proof of criminal activity has been publicly disclosed. Zlochevsky could not be reached for comment, and Burisma did not respond to queries.) In a related investigation, which was ultimately closed owing to a lack of evidence, British authorities temporarily froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky.\n\nIn early 2014, Zlochevsky sought to assemble a high-profile international board to oversee Burisma, telling prospective members that he wanted the company to adopt Western standards of transparency. Among the board members he recruited was a former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who had a reputation as a dedicated reformer. In early 2014, at Zlochevsky’s suggestion, Kwaśniewski met with Archer in Warsaw and encouraged him to join Burisma’s board, arguing that the company was critical to Ukraine’s independence from Russia. Archer agreed.\n\nWhen Archer told Hunter that the board needed advice on how to improve the company’s corporate governance, Hunter recommended the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was “of counsel.” The firm brought in the investigative agency Nardello & Co. to assess Burisma’s history of corruption. Hunter joined Archer on the Burisma board in April, 2014\\. Three months later, in a draft report to Boies Schiller, Nardello said that it was “unable to identify any information to date regarding any current government investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma,” but cited unnamed sources saying that Zlochevsky could be “vulnerable to investigation for financial crimes” and for “perceived abuse of power.”\n\nVice-President Biden was playing a central role in overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine, and took the lead in calling on Kiev to fight rampant corruption. On May 13, 2014, after Hunter’s role on the Burisma board was reported in the news, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a “private citizen.” Hunter told Burisma’s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father. Kwaśniewski told me, “We never discussed how the Vice-President can help us. Frankly speaking, we didn’t need such help.”\n\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter’s role at Burisma had no effect on his father’s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that “Hunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father’s message.” The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted “to be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.” A former business associate said, “The _appearance_ of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.”\n\nIn December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’ ”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter was not always at ease as the son of the Vice-President. He asked that the Secret Service stop deploying agents to accompany him, a request that was eventually granted. He also became offended when he felt that his father wasn’t treated respectfully enough by Obama and his advisers. In 2012, Biden, responding to a question about same-sex marriage on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said that he was “absolutely comfortable” with all couples having the “exact same rights.” Obama had yet to publicly take a similar stance, and Biden’s statement upset some White House officials. Hunter thought that Obama and his advisers should have acknowledged his father’s good political instincts.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a4a87a600089f0d46]||||||\n+++\n\nHunter said that he limited his social interactions with Biden’s White House colleagues, because he didn’t want to be in a situation “where I’m playing golf with the President or one of his aides and look at my phone and see another headline that reads ‘*President Makes Joke About Biden*{: .small}.’ ” Kathleen felt differently about the White House. Their daughter Maisy was in the same class at Sidwell Friends as Sasha, the Obamas’ younger daughter. The two girls became close, and Kathleen and Michelle Obama became friends, attending SoulCycle and Solidcore exercise classes together almost every day. Some evenings, they went out to dinner or had drinks at the White House. Kathleen went on vacations with Michelle, mutual friends, and their daughters.\n\nHunter saw himself as a provider for the Biden family; he even helped to pay off Beau’s law-school debts. But he often wished that, like his father and his brother, he could contribute more to society. Through his business, he got to know an Australian-American former military-intelligence officer named Greg Keeley, who regaled him with stories about his career in the Royal Australian Navy. After moving to the United States, at forty, Keeley had obtained an age waiver to join the U.S. Navy as a reservist. While on reserve duty at a U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan on September 11, 2011, he and members of his unit watched Vice-President Biden deliver a speech at the Pentagon about the attacks of 9/11\\. After the speech, Keeley sent an e-mail to Hunter to tell him that members of his unit thought the Vice-President’s message was “spot on.” Hunter passed the note on to his father, who wrote Keeley an e-mail. “Keep your heads down,” it said. “You are the finest group of warriors in all of history.”\n\nKeeley helped convince Hunter that it wasn’t too late for him to join the Navy Reserves. He told me, “My message to him was: If you feel the call to serve, which I encouraged, it doesn’t really matter what your rank is and what’s on your shoulder board—it is that you’re serving your country. Hunter took that message to heart and acted upon it.” With a letter of recommendation from Keeley, Hunter applied for an age waiver, which the Navy granted. The service has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol-abuse policy, and states that all recruits will be asked “questions about prior drug and alcohol use.” Hunter disclosed that he had “used drugs in the past,” but said that he was now sober, and the Navy granted him a second waiver.\n\nHunter had suffered his first relapse, after seven years of sobriety, in November, 2010, when he drank three Bloody Marys on a flight home from a business trip to Madrid. He continued to drink in secret for several months, then confided in Beau and returned to Crossroads Centre. He had another relapse in early 2013, after he suffered from a bout of shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers. When the prescription ran out, he resumed drinking.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence, but was given a job in a public-affairs unit. In a small, private ceremony at the White House, Hunter was sworn in by his father. Later that month, the night before Hunter’s first weekend of Reserve duty, he stopped at a bar a few blocks from the White House. Outside, Hunter said, he bummed a cigarette from two men who told him that they were from South Africa. He felt “amped up” as he was driving down to Norfolk, and then “incredibly exhausted.” He told me that he called Beau and said, “I don’t know what’s going on.” Beau drove from Delaware to meet Hunter at a hotel near the naval station. “He got me shipshape and drove me into the base,” he said. On his first day, Hunter had a urine sample taken for testing.\n\nA few months later, Hunter received a letter saying that his urinalysis had detected cocaine in his system. Under Navy rules, a positive drug test typically triggers a discharge. Hunter wrote a letter to the Navy Reserve, saying that he didn’t know how the drug had got into his system and suggesting that the cigarettes he’d smoked outside the bar might have been laced with cocaine. Hunter called Beau, who contacted Tom Gallagher, a former Navy lawyer who had worked with Beau at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Philadelphia. Gallagher agreed to represent Hunter pro bono, but it became clear that, given Hunter’s history with drugs, an appeals panel was unlikely to believe the story that he had ingested cocaine involuntarily, and that appealing the decision would require closed-door hearings and the testimony of witnesses, increasing the likelihood of leaks to the press. Hunter decided not to appeal. Navy records show that Hunter’s discharge took effect on February 18, 2014.\n\nHunter did not tell anyone except his father and his brother about the reason for his discharge, and he tried to get his drinking under control. In July, 2014, he went to a clinic in Tijuana that provided a treatment using ibogaine, a psychoactive alkaloid derived from the roots of a West African shrub, which is illegal in America. Hunter then drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where he met with Thom Knoles, a practitioner of Vedic meditation, who said that he advised Hunter to meditate twice a day, to help keep “his cravings for alcohol at bay.” Knoles said that Hunter struck him as “just a good man.” He was “nearly clean,” Knoles said. “But, to be honest, there is such a thing as a dry drunk. I could see that he was in a very delicate position.” Knoles said that Hunter told him about how much he relied on Beau for support and confessed that “his relationship with his other great, deep partner in life, his wife, had been brutalized by him through his loss of control.”\n\nThat fall, Hunter went to Big Sur, California, to attend a twelve-step yoga retreat at the Esalen Institute. Toward the end of his week there, a reporter from the _Wall Street Journal_ contacted the Vice-President’s office, seeking comment on Hunter’s discharge from the Navy. At San Francisco International Airport, Hunter was waiting for his flight home when he saw the story on the front page of the _Journal_. “I was heartbroken,” he said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Hunter, Beau, and their families took a vacation together on Lake Michigan. During the trip, Beau became disoriented and was rushed to the hospital. He’d had a health scare in May, 2010, when—six months after he returned from Iraq—he suffered a stroke. He had appeared to recover quickly, and continued to work as Delaware’s attorney general, but he struggled to remember certain words, and sometimes talked about hearing music playing when there was none.\n\nSoon after Beau’s admittance to the hospital, doctors identified a mass in his brain. It was glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain tumor. Patients who receive similar diagnoses tend to live no longer than two years. As Beau received radiation treatment, his motor and speech skills started to decline. In the spring of 2015, he underwent an experimental procedure in which an engineered virus was injected directly into the tumor, but it was unsuccessful. In late May, doctors removed Beau’s tracheostomy tube, telling the family that he would likely die within a few hours. Beau kept breathing on his own for almost a day and a half before he died, surrounded by his family.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, thousands of people paid their respects at a service at St. Anthony of Padua Church, in Wilmington. The next day, President Obama, Ashley Biden, and Hunter, who was fearful of public speaking, delivered eulogies. On the drive back to Washington, Hunter—moved by the outpouring of support for him and his family at the funeral—told Kathleen that he was thinking about running for public office. She pointed out that he had only recently been discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine. They rode the rest of the way home in silence. (Kathleen declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIn couples therapy, Hunter and Kathleen had reached an agreement: if Hunter started drinking again, he would have to move out of the house. A day after their twenty-second anniversary, Hunter left a therapy session, drank a bottle of vodka, and moved out. Later that month, Zlochevsky, the Burisma co-founder, invited him to Norway on a fishing trip. Hunter brought along Maisy and Beau’s nine-year-old son, Robert. Hunter said that, every night, he and his colleagues on the trip drank a single shot of liquor before going to bed. Kathleen found out and was angry. Hunter began to confide in Hallie, whom he was growing closer to.\n\nHunter said that, in July, 2015, “I tried to show Kathleen: I want back in.” He enrolled as an outpatient in the Charles O’Brien Center for Addiction Treatment, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was prescribed two drugs, one to lessen his cravings and another to make him feel nauseated if he drank. He then enrolled in an inpatient program for executives at Caron Treatment Centers, where he used the pseudonym Hunter Smith. On returning to Washington, he began a program that required him to carry a Breathalyzer with a built-in camera.\n\nThat summer, Ashley Madison, a dating service for married people—which used the slogan “Life is short. Have an affair”—disclosed that hackers had breached its user data. In late August, Breitbart reported that it had found a “Robert Biden” profile among the leaked files. Hunter denied that the account belonged to him, but Kathleen was deeply embarrassed by the story. Two months later, Hunter and Kathleen agreed to formally separate. On October 21, 2015, Joe Biden appeared in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Jill and Obama, and announced that he would not run for President in 2016, talking about the time that it had taken the family to recover from Beau’s death.\n\nUntil mid-December, Hunter practiced yoga daily. A teacher from his yoga studio told me, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person try as hard to heal as he did.” When Hunter stopped coming to class, the teacher went to his apartment, near Logan Circle, and knocked on the door. Hunter told me that he pretended not to be at home. For weeks, he said, he left the apartment only to buy bottles of Smirnoff vodka at Logan Circle Liquor. Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was O.K. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment. Hunter said that his father told him, “I need you. What do we have to do?”\n\nIn February, 2016, Hunter went back to the Esalen Institute, and then spent a week skiing by himself at Lake Tahoe. When he returned to Washington, he enrolled in yet another addiction-treatment program, run by the Kolmac Outpatient Recovery Center. On his way to Kolmac, he passed several homeless people, including a middle-aged woman who went by the name Bicycles, because of the bike she took with her everywhere. Later, whenever Hunter saw Bicycles near his apartment, he would give her a twenty-dollar bill to buy him a pack of Marlboro Reds and tell her to keep the change. One rainy night, Hunter said, he offered Bicycles his spare bedroom, and she stayed for several months.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 2016, Hunter was consulting for five or six major clients. Once or twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that took place in Europe. He said that, in June, 2016, while in Monte Carlo for a meeting, he went to a hotel night club and used cocaine that a stranger offered him in the bathroom. He told his counsellors at Kolmac about his relapse but refused to take a drug test, out of concern that the results could be used against him and published in the press. When Kolmac’s staff insisted that he take the test, he decided to leave the program.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d2]||||||\n+++\n\nIn August, Hunter and Hallie went to the Hamptons with Hallie’s children. They texted constantly after getting back, and Hunter started to spend most nights in Delaware, at Hallie’s house, watching television until very late. “We were sharing a very specific grief,” Hunter recalled. “I started to think of Hallie as the only person in my life who understood my loss.”\n\nThat fall, Hunter made plans to go to the Grace Grove Lifestyle Center, in Sedona, Arizona. During a layover at Los Angeles International Airport, before his connecting flight to Phoenix, he went to a nearby hotel bar and realized that he had left his wallet on the plane. It had belonged to Beau and still contained his attorney-general identification badge, and also Hunter’s driver’s license, without which he couldn’t board his flight. Using a credit card he had in his pocket, Hunter checked into a hotel in Marina del Rey, where he waited for the airline to return the wallet.\n\nInstead of going to Grace Grove, Hunter stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. He said that he “needed a way to forget,” and that, soon after his arrival in L.A., he asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter said that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment, where, in a narrow passageway between tents, someone put a gun to his head before realizing that he was a buyer. He returned to buy more crack a few times that week.\n\nOne night, outside a club on Hollywood Boulevard, Hunter and another man got into an argument, and a group of bouncers intervened. A friend of one of the bouncers, a Samoan man who went by the nickname Baby Down, felt sorry for Hunter and took him to Mel’s Drive-In to get some food, and to his hotel to pick up his belongings. Early on the morning of October 26th, Baby Down dropped Hunter off at the Hertz rental office at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nHunter said that, at that point, he had not slept for several days. Driving east on Interstate 10, just beyond Palm Springs, he lost control of his car, which jumped the median and skidded to a stop on the shoulder of the westbound side. He called Hertz, which came to collect the damaged car and gave him a second rental. Later, on a sharp bend on a mountainous road, Hunter recalled, a large barn owl flew over the hood of the car and then seemed to follow him, dropping in front of the headlights. He said that he has no idea whether the owl was real or a hallucination. On the night of October 28th, Hunter dropped the car off at a Hertz office in Prescott, Arizona, and Grace Grove sent a van to pick him up.\n\nZachary Romfo, who worked at the Hertz office in Prescott, told me that he found a crack pipe in the car and, on one of the consoles, a line of white-powder residue. Beau Biden’s attorney-general badge was on the dashboard. Hertz called the Prescott police department, and officers there filed a “narcotics offense” report, listing the items seized from the car, including a plastic baggie containing a “white powdery substance,” a Secret Service business card, credit cards, and Hunter’s driver’s license. Later, according to a police report, Secret Service agents informed Prescott police that Hunter was “secure/well.” Subsequent test results indicated that the glass pipe contained cocaine residue, but investigators didn’t find any fingerprints on it. Public prosecutors in the county and the city declined to bring a case against Hunter, citing a lack of evidence that the pipe had been used by him. Jon Paladini, Prescott’s city attorney, told me that he was not aware of any requests by officials in Washington to drop the investigation into Hunter. “It’s a very Republican area,” he said. “I don’t think political favors, necessarily, would even work, had they been requested.”\n\nAfter a week at Grace Grove, Hunter checked into a resort spa called Mii Amo, and called Hallie, who flew to meet him. During her stay, Hunter said, they decided to become a couple. When they returned to Delaware, they tried, unsuccessfully, to keep their relationship secret.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, Kathleen filed for divorce, and on February 23, 2017, she filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunter’s assets, alleging that he “created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.” The motion was leaked to the New York _Post_, along with the revelation that Hunter and Hallie were dating.\n\nKathleen told friends that she felt ostracized by the Biden family. Hunter denied hiring prostitutes, and said that he hadn’t been to a strip club in years. But, he said, the evening the story was published, “I went directly to a strip club. I said, ‘Fuck them.’ ”\n\nThe first that Biden heard of the relationship was when the _Post_ asked his office for comment. Hunter issued a statement saying that he and Hallie were “incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time.” Hunter told me he appealed to his father to make a statement, too: “I said, ‘Dad, Dad, you have to.’ He said, ‘Hunter, I don’t know if I should. But I’ll do whatever you want me to do.’ I said, ‘Dad, if people find out, but they think you’re not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong. The kids have to know, Dad, that there’s nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you.’ ” A former Biden aide confirmed that Biden agreed to issue a statement because of concerns about Hunter’s well-being. Biden told the _Post_, “We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. . . . They have mine and Jill’s full and complete support and we are happy for them.” The _Post_ ran the statement under the headline *“Beau Biden’s Widow Having Affair with His Married Brother.”*{: .small}\n\nIn August, Hunter rented a house in Annapolis, Maryland, where he, Hallie, and her two children hoped to have some privacy, but, several months later, they split up. “All we got was shit from everybody, all the time,” Hunter said. “It was really hard. And I realized that I’m not helping anybody by sticking around.” (Hallie declined to comment.) In early 2018, he moved to Los Angeles. The idea, he said, was to “completely disappear.”\n\nHunter said that, in divorce proceedings, he offered to give Kathleen “everything,” including a monthly payment of thirty-seven thousand dollars for alimony, tuition, and child-care costs for a decade. Hunter told me that he was living on approximately four thousand dollars a month; he was hardly poor, but it was an adjustment. On occasion, transactions on his credit cards were declined.\n\nOne of Kathleen’s motions contains a reference to “a large diamond” that had come into Hunter’s possession. The motion seems to imply that it was one of Hunter’s “personal indulgences.” When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars.\n\nHunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye’s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter’s hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. “I was, like, Oh, my God,” Hunter said. (In Kathleen’s court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: “What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn’t in office.” Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesn’t know what they did with it. “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,” he said.\n\nHunter began negotiating a deal for CEFC to invest forty million dollars in a liquefied-natural-gas project on Monkey Island, in Louisiana, which, he said, was projected to create thousands of jobs. “I was more proud of it than you can imagine,” he told me. In the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a “shady character at all,” and characterized the outcome as “bad luck.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJoe Biden is hardly the first politician to have faced scrutiny for the business dealings of a family member. In 1973, during the Watergate investigation, the Washington _Post_ reported that [Richard Nixon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-nixon) had the phone of his brother Donald tapped for at least a year, because he feared that Donald’s “various financial activities might bring embarrassment to the Nixon administration.” In the late seventies, the F.B.I. investigated President [Jimmy Carter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jimmy-carter)’s younger brother, Billy, after it emerged that he was on the payroll of the Libyan government. In an extensive report on the affair issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Biden was a member, Billy was quoted as saying that “he did not need anyone in Washington telling him how to conduct his private business.” Carter said that he had tried, unsuccessfully, to “discourage Billy from making any other trip to Libya” and “to keep him out of the newspapers for a few weeks.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d168899f2cdba00092a45b9]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nBiden’s approach was to deal with Hunter’s activities by largely ignoring them. This may have temporarily allowed Biden to truthfully inform reporters that his decisions were not affected by Hunter. But, as Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.”\n\nIt is clear that Hunter and Biden’s decades-old decision not to discuss business matters has exposed both father and son to attacks. (Biden declined to comment for this article.) In March of last year, Peter Schweizer, a conservative researcher and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart, published “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.” Schweizer is best known for “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Clinton Rich,” which was released in May, 2015\\. Research for that book was funded by the Government Accountability Institute, which Schweizer co-founded, in 2012, with Stephen Bannon. Under the law, the G.A.I. is a nonpartisan organization. But, as Joshua Green wrote, in “Devil’s Bargain,” his book about Bannon’s role in Trump’s rise, Bannon saw “Clinton Cash” as “the key to orchestrating Hillary Clinton’s downfall.” It was, Green writes, “the culmination of everything Bannon learned during his time in Goldman Sachs, Internet Gaming Entertainment, Hollywood, and Breitbart News.”\n\nAs Bannon and Schweizer had hoped, investigative journalists from the mainstream press followed up on Schweizer’s many examples of the Clintons’ purported conflicts of interest. In April, 2015, two weeks before Schweizer’s book came out, the _Times_ published a front-page article, by Jo Becker and Mike McIntire, that cited Schweizer’s research alongside Becker’s own reporting from 2008\\. The article singled out a Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra, who donated tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The story suggested that the donations of Giustra and others might have created conflicts of interest, at a time when the Obama Administration was negotiating to allow the Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to gain control of a swath of America’s untapped uranium deposits by purchasing the Canadian company Uranium One. The _Times_ was criticized for building on Schweizer’s work, and, two years later, Eileen Sullivan, in another _Times_ article, wrote, “There has been no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced the Uranium One deal.” Still, “Clinton Cash” did exactly what Bannon hoped it would do, Green writes, “sullying Clinton’s image in a way that she never fully recovered from.”\n\n“Secret Empires,” which details Hunter’s activities in China and Ukraine, focusses on what Schweizer calls “corruption by proxy,” which he defines as a “new corruption” that is “difficult to detect” and that, though often legal, makes “good money for a politician and his family and friends” and leaves “American politicians vulnerable to overseas financial pressure.” Schweizer often relies on innuendo to supplement his reporting. At one point, he describes “one of the few public sightings” of Hunter in Beijing, when Hunter, “dressed in a dark overcoat,” followed Biden into a shop to buy a Magnum ice cream. “Intentionally or not,” Schweizer writes, “Hunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had _guanxi_”—connections.\n\nSchweizer asserts that “Rosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.” In fact, the deal had been signed before the trip—according to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterward—and Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasn’t with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was “lucrative” for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn October, 2017, the special counsel [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on twelve counts, including committing conspiracy against the United States by failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine. (Manafort pleaded guilty to that charge in September, 2018.) Making a case that Hunter had his own Ukrainian scandal, Schweizer implies that Joe Biden had been consulted in advance about Hunter and Archer’s work with Burisma. On April 16, 2014, he notes, shortly before the announcement that Hunter and Archer had taken seats on the company’s board, Archer made a “private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice-President Biden.” Hunter, Archer, and Archer’s son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-President’s hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed.\n\nRudolph Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, has also aggressively promoted what he has called the “alleged Ukraine conspiracy” in interviews and on social media. Giuliani told me that, in the fall of 2018, he spoke to Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general. Shokin told him that Vice-President Biden had him fired in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma and the company’s payments to Hunter and Archer. Giuliani said that, in January, 2019, he met with Yurii Lutsenko, Ukraine’s current prosecutor general, in New York, and Lutsenko confirmed Shokin’s version of events.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, John Solomon, an opinion contributor to _The Hill,_ wrote about Shokin’s claim that he had been conducting a corruption probe into Burisma and Hunter when he was dismissed. A month later, the _Times_ reported that Hunter “was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The story, by Kenneth P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel, provoked some Democrats to express concern that the _Times_ was again lending credence to allegations made by Schweizer and other Trump allies. Giuliani retweeted the article, and Trump called for the Justice Department to investigate. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Obama, tweeted, “Zero lessons have been learned from 2016: 1\\. Mainstream outlet credulously accepts Trump conspiracy about opponent 2\\. Trump propaganda machine uses story to spread the conspiracy on social media and through digital ads 3\\. Voters believe it, ignoring subsequent fact checks.”\n\nThere is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokin’s removal in order to protect Hunter. According to Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, Shokin was removed because of concerns by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the U.S. government that he wasn’t pursuing corruption investigations. Contrary to the assertions that Shokin was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Zlochevsky, Hochstein said, “many of us in the U.S. government believed that Shokin was the one protecting Zlochevsky.” In May, Giuliani scheduled a visit to Ukraine, and told the _Times_ that he would look into Hunter’s involvement with Burisma, “because that information will be very, very helpful to my client,” but then abruptly cancelled the trip, amid reports that Ukraine’s President-elect was unwilling to meet with him. A week later, on May 16th, Lutsenko appeared to shift his position on Burisma, telling Bloomberg News that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, and that “a company can pay however much it wants to its board.” The reasons for his reversal were unclear, but Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, in Kiev, speculated that Lutsenko, in talking with Giuliani, had been trying to “pump his political muscle,” a strategy that had proved ineffective in the new political climate.\n\nThat month, Hunter declined Burisma’s offer to serve another term on the board, believing that the controversy had become a distraction. But he said that he was proud of his work there, and that he thought the criticism was misplaced. “I feel the decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me,” he told me. “Was it worth it? Was it worth the pain? No. It certainly wasn’t worth the grief.” He went on, “I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”\n\nAnd yet, to many voters, the controversy over Hunter’s business dealings will appear to have been avoidable, a product of Biden’s resistance to having difficult conversations, particularly those involving his family. Hunter said that, in his talks with his father, “I’m saying sorry to him, and he says, ‘I’m the one who’s sorry,’ and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, ‘Look, it’s going to go away.’ There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away. So can you survive the assault?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn early May, Hunter met a thirty-two-year-old South African woman named Melissa Cohen, a filmmaker who was working on a series of documentaries about indigenous tribes in southern Africa. A few days after their first date, Hunter had the word “shalom” tattooed in Hebrew letters on the inside of his left bicep, to match a tattoo that Cohen has in the same spot. On May 15th, less than a week after they met, he proposed. The next morning, she accepted, and he bought the simplest gold wedding bands he could find, then called a marriage service, which sent over an officiant.\n\nA month later, on the roof deck of Cohen’s apartment, off the Sunset Strip, Cohen sat on a bench next to Hunter, who was wearing jeans and a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan *“BE FUCKING NICE.”*{: .small} Hunter recalled that, after the ceremony, “I called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, ‘Thank you for giving my son the courage to love again.’ ” Hunter paused, his eyes filling with tears. “And he said to me, ‘Honey, I knew that when you found love again that I’d get you back.’ ” Cohen rubbed his shoulders. He went on, “And my reply was, I said, ‘Dad, I always had love. And the only thing that allowed me to see it was the fact that you never gave up on me, you always believed in me.’ ”\n\nHunter told me that, on a recent evening, he had seen reports on Twitter that Trump was calling for him to be investigated by the Justice Department. Then Hunter noticed a helicopter overhead. “I said, ‘I hope they’re taking pictures of us right now. I hope it’s a live feed to the President so he can see just how much I care about the tweets.’ ” He went on, “I told Melissa, ‘I don’t care. Fuck you, Mr. President. Here I am, living my life.’ ” ♦\n\nA previous version of this article misspelled Brian McGlinchey’s last name and mischaracterized the New York _Times_’ interaction with Peter Schweizer and its reporting on Uranium One.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"},{"id":"5c2e1cd1ee7fe02cbd1633a7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sons","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sons"},{"id":"5c2e1c7736cecf40192141c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidential Candidates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidential-candidates"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca722d4972cd5b832c6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drugs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drugs"},{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hunter Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hunter-biden"}],"sections":[{"id":"5944867342fa443beba19b29","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5a6100548bcd0613d5da686f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Entous joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering intelligence, national security, and foreign affairs.

June of 2018, Ajay Kumar, a thirty-two-year-old farmer with a thick beard and a soft voice, left Haryana, a state in northern India. He told me that political opponents had been intimidating him for being a loud and persistent activist and that they had eventually forced him to leave. His family pooled money, and he used it to fly to Ecuador, a country that he didn’t need a visa to enter. From there, he stole across the Colombian border, made his way through the rain forests of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Honduras, and crossed into Mexico. He lost clothes, money, and, at one point, his shoes. He worried that he would be killed by gangs, or that he would die of drowning or dehydration. “We never know how, what, when, where we will die,” he told me recently. Two months after he left India, Kumar reached the U.S.-Mexico border, near Otay Mesa, California, and turned himself in to Border Patrol.\n\n \n\nSouth Asian Americans Leading Together, a nonprofit organization, has noted an uptick in Indian asylum seekers entering the country. Kumar was one of nearly nine thousand Indians apprehended along the southern border of the U.S. in 2018—a remarkable rise from the year before, when roughly three thousand were apprehended. A decade ago, there were only ninety-nine. The increase has been caused by a mix of political and economic factors. Since Prime Minister [Narendra Modi](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/an-indian-political-theorist-on-the-triumph-of-narendra-modis-hindu-nationalism) and the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power, in 2014, there has been a rise in violence, threats, and intimidation against minorities and members of the political opposition in India. In the past few decades, the country’s economy has also undergone a rapid liberalization, and inequality has intensified. According to Oxfam, the richest one per cent of India’s population now owns more than fifty per cent of the country’s wealth. As a result, thousands have been fleeing the country; many fly to Central America, where they begin a treacherous journey north to the United States. Earlier this summer, a six-year-old Indian girl died of heatstroke near the Arizona-Mexico border. Over the past several months, the U.S. has been trying to stop Indian migrants before they even reach the border. Last week, Mexico deported more than three hundred  Indian migrants who were waiting to cross into the U.S., under a deal with the Trump Administration to avoid tariffs on Mexican exports. In 2016, two anonymous *ICE*{: .small} officials described to Buzzfeed the agency’s unofficial policy toward Indian asylum seekers: “Keep them out. If you catch them, detain them.”\n\n \n\nWhen Kumar reached California, he spent a few days in a packed cell, and then he and other asylum seekers were put on buses and planes—with chains around their hands, feet, and stomach, “as if we were some criminals,” Kumar recalled—and sent to New Mexico. Kumar ended up in the Otero County Processing Center, an *ICE*{: .small} facility managed by a private contractor, where he says his treatment worsened. The officers spoke to Kumar and other Indian asylum seekers in English and Spanish, and refused to provide translators (except when they filled out medical questionnaires), despite the fact that the migrants spoke only Punjabi and Hindi. Kumar and other Indian asylum seekers were vegetarian because of their religious beliefs, and the staff sometimes taunted them and made them wait until everyone else got food before they could eat. But what made Kumar most upset was that he and the other migrants were subjected to “animal-like treatment”—foul language, aggression, and punitive responses to minor violations of the rules. “When they cursed at the Indians and treated them badly, I couldn’t stand seeing it, so I would speak out against them,” Kumar told me. “If I said something, they would put me in the *SHU*{: .small}”—the Special Housing Unit, a euphemism for solitary confinement—“for fifteen days, ten days, by myself in a small room.” (*ICE*{: .small} did not respond to my request for comment.)\n\n \n\nWhile at Otero, Kumar was sent to the *SHU*{: .small} eight or nine times. Each time, it was for an alleged minor infraction, often for speaking back to officers. Once, he told me, a security officer photocopied asylum materials for others who had requested the service, but not for him; when he accused the officer of racism, he was sent to the *SHU*{: .small}. On a different occasion, he said, *ICE*{: .small} officers accused him of striking another migrant; he saw that there were cameras in the facilities, but, when he asked to see video footage of the incident, they refused and sent him to the *SHU*{: .small}. In 2017, representatives from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (O.I.G.) investigated Otero and suggested that the staff in the center were misusing solitary confinement. “Some detainees were locked down in their cells for violations of minor rules without required written notification of reasons for lock-down and appeal options,” the investigators wrote, in a report. “Documentation of daily medical visits and meal records for detainees being held in segregation was also missing or incomplete.”\n\n \n\nIn March of this year, Kumar learned that an immigration judge had rejected his application for asylum, finding the evidence of persecution he had presented not credible, and had ordered his deportation. Kumar filed an appeal. While he waited, he requested to be released on bond, something he had been asking for since he was apprehended, but *ICE*{: .small} refused. Though *ICE*{: .small} uses punitive measures against detainees, people in immigration detention are officially being held for an administrative violation rather than for a criminal offense, which means that, except in special circumstances, there is no legal limit on how long they can be held. “I understand the desperation that many detainees feel, where they feel there is no control over any aspect of their life,” Linda Corchado, Kumar’s lawyer, told me.\n\n \n\nIn July, Kumar went on a hunger strike to protest his indefinite detention and looming deportation. “I decided if I am going to die, I’ll die here,” he told me. When the officers at Otero saw that Kumar had stopped eating and drinking, they sent him to solitary. A few days later, he could hear the officers putting others in *SHU*{: .small} rooms near his. He couldn’t see or talk to them and only later learned that five other Indian men had also gone on hunger strike. He did not know what had sparked their protest, though the Otero staff considered him their ringleader, nonetheless. “I had one demand from the beginning,” he told me. “I just want my freedom. I didn’t ask for anything else.”\n\n \n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\n \n\nIn mid-July, Kumar and three other hunger strikers were transferred to the El Paso Service Processing Center’s medical unit, in Texas, where Kumar was at times isolated from the others. *ICE*{: .small} obtained a court authorization to force-feed them, a procedure that involves pushing a tube through a patient’s nose and down the esophagus. One of the migrants had just been treated for a nose infection, and, as *ICE*{: .small} doctors placed the tube in his nostril, he began spitting blood and lost consciousness. According to Corchado, who also represented this detainee, the doctor administering the tubes told him, “End your hunger strike and we’ll stop this.” He ended the strike that night.\n\n \n\nForce-feeding is painful and potentially harmful to patients, and organizations including the Red Cross, the American Medical Association, and the World Medical Association consider it medically unethical; in a press release from 2006, the W.M.A. called it “a form of inhuman and degrading treatment.” But as an increasing number of *ICE*{: .small} detainees have gone on hunger strike—there have been at least a thousand three hundred and ninety-six cases since 2015—the agency has often resorted to the practice. In January, a group of Indian asylum seekers dubbed the “El Paso Nine” banded together in a collective hunger strike. A court gave authorization for them to be force-fed, but the feeding was stopped after two or three weeks in the face of mounting pressure from politicians, activists, and lawyers. Seven of the strikers were eventually deported, and two were released to await rulings on their cases. But forty-nine members of Congress signed a letter to the Department of Homeland Security demanding an investigation into the use of force-feeding by *ICE*{: .small}. As a result, earlier this year, representatives from the O.I.G. visited the El Paso facility again, this time to observe the practice of force-feeding. The O.I.G. recently released its findings to Congress. It seemed to find a level of impunity in the facility’s operations. In the course of four years, there were a hundred and thirty-seven grievances filed against *ICE*{: .small} officers involving allegations of physical or verbal abuse, but only one officer was fired and four re-assigned. However, the O.I.G. concluded that force-feeding in El Paso was carried out “to ensure the detainees’ safety and the safety of the facility.”\n\n  \n\nKumar was taken off the feeding tube after nearly a month and then persisted in his strike. His weight dropped, as did his blood pressure and heart rate. He started getting severe abdominal pains. “I was literally seeing him die in front of me,” Corchado told me. Kumar’s lawyers argued that he had a First Amendment right to go on hunger strike, and that an alternative to force-feeding existed: *ICE*{: .small} could release him on bond and into the care of a community hospital. They also argued that the medical treatment Kumar was receiving in *ICE*{: .small} custody was putting him in danger; an independent doctor, who pored over more than four hundred pages of Kumar’s medical records from El Paso, found that *ICE*{: .small} doctors had hardly visited Kumar. The doctor concluded, in her testimony to the court, that it was “the worst medical care I have seen in my ten years of practice.”\n\n \n\nOn September 12th, the court allowed *ICE*{: .small} to resume force-feeding Kumar. The judge wrote in his opinion that he couldn’t order *ICE*{: .small} to release Kumar, but he scolded the government for not having given Kumar an independent doctor’s evaluation and for what the judge called its “penological” treatment of him. “An individual seeking asylum is not akin to a criminal prisoner,” he wrote. A week later, *ICE*{: .small} offered Kumar a deal, which he accepted: he would be released if he resumed eating and wore a monitoring device. Corchado speculates that, with the judge’s opinion and growing public scrutiny, Kumar had become a liability for *ICE*{: .small}.\n\n \n\nAt the end of his hunger strike, Kumar weighed a hundred and seven pounds. He left the El Paso facility on September 26th and is now staying with an immigration activist in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He is eating solid foods again, and gardening, and he recently enrolled in E.S.L. classes. But he can’t run like he used to, and he’s still regaining his vision after going partially blind from starvation. “I’m not fully recovered,” he told me, two weeks after his release. “There are some mental issues—I can’t remember everything. But I’m better than before.”\n\n \n\nIn September, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed to remand Kumar’s asylum case back to the immigration judge, concluding that the initial ruling, which judged Kumar’s testimony to be not credible, was “clearly erroneous.” Kumar’s case will be heard again, in December, by the same judge. His odds are not great—more than forty-one per cent of Indian asylum seekers were ordered to be deported from the United States last year, and the percentage is likely to be even higher this year. Still, he remains hopeful. When I asked him to reflect on how he had managed to last two months without food or water, he became thoughtful, noting that he had never considered the length of his strike before. He added, “I only thought, freedom or death—I’ll get one of the two.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum

She is otherwise known as an unaccompanied alien child, or U.A.C. She left her home in Central America, crossed the southern border, and was detained for a week—in Texas, she thinks—in a facility where breakfast was a cold bean burrito, lunch was a cup of microwavable noodle soup, and dinner was a cold bean burrito. She says that the detention facility was fine—no, nothing bad happened. Yes, it was only girls. Her main complaint is that she was not allowed to brush her teeth.\n\nFrom the detention center, she was taken to a shelter in the Pacific Northwest for such children. She remains in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (O.R.R.), waiting to hear that she has been cleared to travel on to her family members in this country. I meet her during her first seventy-two hours at the shelter, when she is brought to my clinic for an initial refugee-health screening. The shelter is fine, she says. The people are very nice.\n\nToday, I will order a chest X-ray and a series of blood tests. I will ask her a long list of intrusive questions, and I’ll send the answers to O.R.R. I’ll tell O.R.R., for example, when her last period was. I will tell them whether she has been physically or sexually abused, and, if so, in what country. I will tell them if she has frequent headaches and whether she wishes to commit suicide, homicide, both, or neither. I will send them the results of testing for H.I.V, tuberculosis, and pregnancy. \n\nBut I am not the government. I am not *ICE*{: .small}. I am a pediatrician. In these encounters, my colleagues and I try to make it clear that we wish these children no harm. At the same time, we must explain that our conversations are not entirely private. Every result will leave my office, leave my hands, and factor somehow—in ways I cannot know or predict—into this child’s uncertain future. Most of the cases of children seeking asylum will be denied, and the children will be deported. \n\nI can hear other children in the hallway outside, most of whom are visiting our clinic for their routine well-child checks. A new baby is being weighed, and his mother claps her hands happily and then whispers to the baby in Somali when the medical assistant hands him back to her. You can hear pride in her voice, delight that the baby is thriving.\n\nI begin to fill out the “family history” section of the form, and ask the girl if her parents are living. Her mother is alive and has no health conditions. Her father died. She is not sure how old he was. I have to ask how he died, and she looks at me flatly and says, “They killed him.”\n\nI am silenced, though I have heard this sentence drop from the mouths of children before. She looks at me strangely while I pause. I have to remind myself that I will not be forming a long-term relationship with this girl. I will be her pediatrician while she is in the shelter, and that is all. I ought not make her trudge through the details of her father’s murder. So I make a mark on the form and move on.\n\nNo, she has not had surgery. She has no allergies or health conditions. She takes no medicines. She has never been sexually active. She has never been raped or physically abused.\n\nBut when I begin my exam I find scars on her arm, three long parallel lines where the skin is pale and puckered. Burns, I think. Every pediatrician knows to look for patterns in wounds: straight lines or perfect circles, bruises with the slap-marks of fingers, things a child could not have done to herself. Someone has hurt this girl, on purpose.\n\nI ask her how it happened. I have asked this same question of dozens of children. The intent is to get their story without suggesting a cause.\n\n“Oh,” she says, as if she had forgotten it. “They did that to me.”\n\nWhen?\n\n“When I was nine. They kidnapped me.” She explained that “they” thought her family had money because her aunt was already in the United States. She doesn’t name “them”—these torturers of children, murderers of fathers. I am not the police and do not need to know who “they” are. There is nothing I could do with that knowledge if I had it. So I simply take up her language, using the “they” form of the verbs in Spanish.\n\n“How did this happen?” I ask. This is for documentation. I have been trained to document the sources of scars; if I document both scars that the patient says are from torture and scars which the patient says are not from torture, it supposedly lends veracity to their story in the mind of someone (I don’t know who) who will make a decision (I don’t know what) about her life.\n\nShe says she doesn’t know. They gave her a drug, she says, and it put her to sleep.\n\nI ask her if she wants to see a counsellor who specializes in trauma. This is also, technically, off-script. Here is how I’ve been trained to explain the concept of trauma to a kid: “When kids go through something very scary like that, fear and pain can hide in their body for a long time. It can come out in ways that surprise you, making you feel scared, or angry, or lonely. Some kids feel their heart beating very fast, and some have nightmares. Our counsellors help kids work through this, so the fear and pain can leave the body and you can feel more healthy.”\n\nPediatricians refer to experiences that cause children severe or chronic stress as Adverse Childhood Experiences (*ACE*{: .small}s). *ACE*{: .small}s include exposure to violence, neglect, and sexual abuse, among many others. A burgeoning body of research in child development shows that childhood stressors can compound to affect long-term health, including the risk of diabetes, heart disease, substance abuse, and suicide in adulthood. When *ACE*{: .small}s are severe or prolonged, they can even affect the physical structure of a kid’s brain. Trauma-focussed counselling is one of the ways we try to mitigate these effects.\n\nBut the girl declines counselling. It was a long time ago, she says. She was very upset at the time, but her mother helped her recover.\n\nI want to hear this girl talk about her own strength, and I want to learn how a child recovers emotionally from kidnapping and torture. So I stay off-script, asking, “How did she do that?”\n\n“We talked,” she says. She smiles, and tells me that her mother understands her very well.  I believe her.\n\nThe power of mothers and fathers—families—to protect children is remarkable. When loving, consistent adults, such as this girl’s mother, are present for a kid, experiencing trauma in childhood need not be a sentence to long-term suffering and ill health; early research suggests that strong families can mitigate the effects of trauma on a child’s body, brain, and development. For example, [a study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2749336) published in September, in *JAMA Pediatrics*, describes the health effects of positive childhood experiences, such as having a parent in the home whom you trust. Researchers found that such positive experiences could reduce rates of depression and poor mental health in adulthood, including people who also score high on *ACE*{: .small}s. Primary-care pediatricians are learning not only to screen for *ACE*{: .small}s but to equip families with the tools they need to help kids flourish despite trauma.\n\nThe harm done to children who are separated from their families, by border policies or *ICE*{: .small} raids or incarceration, is evil precisely because the absence of parents makes it difficult for children to recover from the trauma of the separation itself. It is a mean trick to play on a child: traumatize her by taking a parent away, then keep her from that parent—the exact person she needs in order to recover.\n\nThe girl is looking at me steadily, waiting for my next question. So I finish the mandatory questions and explain the next steps: blood test, chest X-ray, vaccines. I apologize for all the vaccines.\n\n“Will it hurt?” she asks, and, with that question, she finally sounds like a kid.\n\n“It will,” I say. “But we’ll do it fast, and then it will be over.”\n\nShe tells me she is scared of needles, and she fidgets in her seat.\n\nIt’s normal to be scared, but I know she is very strong, I tell her. I also know that I would not typically put a kid through so much in one visit. Typically, although I might interview a teen-ager on her own, I wouldn’t examine her without a parent in the room. But this child’s only living parent is thousands of miles away. This is the protocol; she is in the custody of O.R.R., and this clinic visit will get her one step closer to being reunited with family.\n\nAt least, that is how I explain it to myself. In these visits, my colleagues and I engage in what I have come to think of as small acts of humane resistance: we try to be patient and kind with the kids, to treat them as fully human and deeply valuable, even as violence in their home countries, conditions in our detention centers, and border policies align to insist that their lives are worthless.\n\nIs that enough? To smile at a kid, to try to make her comfortable? Of course, it is not enough. No act of resistance is sufficient for this horror. And my efforts to distinguish myself from the government—*I am not *ICE*{: .small}; I am not *ICE*{: .small}*—feel vain.\n\nIn fact, I am within and of this system, and the ways in which I benefit from it are not at all obscure. The state of Texas paid for my medical education. The federal government funds residency training—from whence we physicians get our specialties, our incomes, the medical knowledge that crowds our minds.\n\nI am also an ordinary American—a citizen of a nation that is incarcerating children and putting their health at risk. Some of those children have died preventable and unnecessary deaths while in our nation’s custody. This child has been sent by a loving mother who hopes that she might enjoy what so many—though certainly not all—ordinary Americans do: a chance to survive childhood, to finish school. She is a bright amalgam of hopes, flung across a hemisphere into this moment.\n\nBut, at this moment, she is also a teen-ager, and the prospect of getting shots has tipped her into misery. She looks like she wants to cry, and so, instead of leaving the room while my assistant prepares the vaccines, I stay.\n\nI ask her what she is hoping for. I will not report this answer to the government, but after such an invasive and unhelpful interview, I scratch for something to redeem the afternoon, something to help us both feel better.\n\n“Here?” she asks, glancing over at the scale by the sink, which is decorated with a giraffe.\n\n“I mean here in the United States.”\n\nAnd she gives the same answer that so many of my other teen-age-refugee and asylum-seeking patients give: she wants to go to school.\n\n“And what do you want to be when you grow up?” I ask the girl.\n\nShe smiles again. “An architect,” she says.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1dd87e716b454591af01","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Family Separations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"family-separations"},{"id":"5c2e1c7636cecf40192141be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Refugees","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"refugees"},{"id":"5c2e2e32397f5b30646d0a4c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Refugee Children","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"refugee-children"},{"id":"5c2e1c882396212cbb9fc9b0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration-and-customs-enforcement-ice"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c2bfcc72cd92d0546","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Doctors","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"doctors"}],"sections":[{"id":"5a8c99f952e589162b850cbc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dispatch","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dispatch"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5cf965fb91fa13c048b2b7d8","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Rachel Pearson","socialMedia":[],"title":"Rachel Pearson is a pediatrician and humanities scholar at U.T.

Nearly all of them had been deported from the United States in the previous six months, including the pastor, Mabel González. She had been [separated](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-uncounted-families-torn-apart-at-the-border-by-the-trump-administration) from two of her children in September of 2017, in El Paso, where she was detained for more than a year. Now she was calling the group to prayer with an exhortation: “You have to say, ‘I’m not going to let anything bad overtake me.’&nbsp;” The room was small and dimly lit, with pocked floors, bare walls, and a fold-out table littered with empty juice bottles; a small pink fan wheezed in the corner. Seated in a half circle, members of the group shared stories of their time in U.S. detention. “I’m still traumatized,” Luis Bonilla, a man in his early forties, said. He’d been transferred among detention centers in Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia, and, after falling gravely ill while in custody, he signed what’s called a voluntary-departure order, abandoning his asylum claim. “I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “And now I have to go back! It gives me the chills. It enrages me. But I can’t stay at home. We are living the crisis in Honduras in the flesh.”\n\nThose Hondurans came to mind last week, when the Department of Homeland Security announced the latest in a series of accords that it has been signing with nations in Central America. Known as safe-third-country agreements, they will force migrants travelling to the U.S. to apply for asylum in the first country they enter on their route. Then, if they reach American soil, the U.S. government, rather than allowing them to apply for asylum in this country, will be able to send them back to that first (i.e., third) country, on the grounds that they should have pursued their claims there. The latest signatory was Honduras, whose government, led by President Juan Orlando Hernández, is notorious for corruption and repression. He himself has been accused of bankrolling past political campaigns with drug money, and his brother is currently standing [trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/world/americas/el-chapo-honduras-drug-trial.html) in New York on drug-trafficking charges. (President Hernández has denied any involvement in drug crimes; his brother has pleaded not guilty.) Since 2013, when Hernández became President, tens of thousands of Hondurans have left the country, to escape gang violence, a cratered economy, and political mismanagement. This past year, roughly two hundred thousand Hondurans have been apprehended at the U.S. border. \n\nUnder the new agreements, which are set to go into effect sometime in the coming months, the U.S. will be sending asylum seekers to the same countries that most of the region’s migrants are already fleeing. In addition to Honduras, this is true of Guatemala and El Salvador, with which the U.S. signed analogous agreements in July and September, respectively. During the past year, ninety-two per cent of all immigrants apprehended at the southern border were families from these three countries; none of them has an asylum system capable of handling an influx of tens of thousands of people. In Guatemala, according to [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/guatemala-safe-refugees-and-asylum-seekers), there are twelve government officials working on the asylum process, and only three who conduct asylum interviews. Last year, the government approved just twenty asylum claims. \n\nThe implementation of the agreements still needs to be worked out, but the terms create an interlocking set of restrictions on the flow of migrants to the U.S. Hondurans and Salvadorans will have to apply for asylum in Guatemala. Asylum seekers from elsewhere in Latin America will be forced to stop in El Salvador or Honduras. For the time being, they are the southernmost countries to have signed safe-third-country agreements. This summer, the Department of Homeland Security tried to negotiate a deal with Panama—which officials describe as the “chokepoint of the isthmus”—but the government balked. If a deal with Mexico goes through, as the Administration hopes, Guatemalans will have to seek asylum there. \n\nWhen I sat down with the Honduran migrants, only the Guatemalan deal had been signed, and the U.S. government’s broader plans for the region were still an abstract prospect. The reason the Hondurans were in Tapachula was to apply for visas so that they could move through Mexico to the U.S. After being deported back to Honduras, they had travelled north immediately. Stopping in Guatemala wasn’t an option. They knew the country, having travelled through it multiple times; they had bribed border agents there and ducked local criminals. In addition, jobs were nonexistent there, which was why more people were leaving Guatemala than Honduras, and the Honduran gangs that many in the group were fleeing also had extensive operations in Guatemala. Mexico hadn’t been much better. Violence against migrants has raged for years, particularly in areas controlled by the cartels, and a Trump Administration policy called the [Migrant Protection Protocols](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-the-us-asylum-system-is-keeping-migrants-at-risk-in-mexico) has exacerbated the situation along Mexico’s northern border. A former bank teller in his early twenties, named Henry, who was seeking to make the trip north with his wife and toddler, told me, “I did some field work here, but they took advantage of me because I was a foreigner.” For fourteen hours’ labor, he was paid eighty pesos, roughly four U.S. dollars. The only person in the group who had found viable work, doing construction and carpentry, is now trying to leave Tapachula, because a local group has begun extorting him. \n\nThere are two currents now shaping U.S. immigration policy in the Trump Administration. One emanates from Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of D.H.S., who is the architect of the safe-third-country agreements. (His days in the job may be numbered, however. He recently told the Washington *Post*, “What I don’t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time.”) The other comes from the White House, where, the *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html) this week, the President has called for electrified fences, skin-piercing spikes, and alligator-filled moats to keep migrants from crossing the border, and his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, has been crafting the most punishing policies to come out of the executive branch in decades. In July, while D.H.S. officials were negotiating the terms of the agreement with Guatemala, the White House went ahead and issued  a regulation that would effectively end asylum altogether. The regulation states that, unless asylum seekers at the southern border have already tried to apply for asylum in another country, they will be turned away. (A federal judge immediately blocked it, but last month the Supreme Court [allowed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-immigration-attorney-at-the-aclu-on-fighting-trumps-asylum-ban) the policy to go into effect while it is being challenged in court.) The move was typical of the White House, in that it ignored the potential fallout in Central America. McAleenan’s strategy shares the same core logic of curtailing asylum at the U.S. border, but, he says, he has tried to engage with the larger issues. This summer, in Guatemala City, where he was meeting with local groups to sell the safe-third-country deal, he told reporters, “You can’t address migration flows at a single destination point. You’ve got to have a partnership between the source, transit, and destination countries. The history, globally, of irregular migration has proven that.” In the past several months, through a separate series of security accords signed with other countries in the region, he achieved significant results: the number of people apprehended at the border each month has dropped by two-thirds, mostly owing to enforcement initiatives undertaken with Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nHow should the U.S. be responding to migrants like those I met in Tapachula? By the limited terms of current U.S. asylum law, few of them have claims that would win in immigration court. And, since many of them have been deported before, the chance that they might gain lawful entry this time is unlikely. In defense of the safe-third-country agreements, the Department of Homeland Security argues that the asylum system is being flooded by claims that will be rejected anyway. “The bulk of these people are economic migrants,” a senior Administration official told me, and as such, under current U.S. law, they do not qualify for legal protection. At the same time, the government also views people fleeing gang or domestic violence, who make up the vast majority of asylum cases from Central America, as largely ineligible as well. Here the legal reasoning is that asylum seekers must belong to “particular social group” and be persecuted because of their identity or political beliefs. While immigration jurisprudence has expanded slightly over the years to broaden the understanding of what constitutes such a “social group,” the Trump Administration’s Department of Justice has worked relentlessly to reverse such gains. “Only ten to fifteen per cent of the Central Americans seeking asylum in the U.S. actually get it,” the official told me, and if the government does not try to curb the flow, authorities at the border will continue to be overwhelmed by more migrants than the system was ever equipped to handle. So, “the short-term goal” of the safe-third-country deals “is deterrence,” the official said, but added that “the long-term goal is to set the stage for investment and development in the region. There has to be a way for people to live in the hemisphere. It can’t just be the U.S. and Canada.” \n\nAccording to the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/acting-homeland-security-chief-frustrated-and-isolated--even-as-he-delivers-what-trump-wants-at-the-border/2019/10/01/b62e740c-e3ad-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html), “McAleenan sees the accords as an alternative to the president’s previous impulse to cut off the region entirely.” The deal with Guatemala was supposed to include benefits for Guatemalans, in the form of promises to “double or triple” the five thousand temporary agricultural visas currently issued by the U.S. each year. There’s also a proposal to build the country’s asylum capacity, taken from a plan drafted last year by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will allocate forty-seven million dollars designed to help the country build shelters, hire more staff to handle claims, and open more asylum offices. But whether these proposals are realistic and can be implemented anytime soon is an open question; Guatemala has not yet instituted any such plans. \n\nIn fact, although the senior official I spoke with stressed that the accords were a step toward “making regional governments more accountable and responsive” to the issue of migration, the effect so far seems to have been opportunism from the leaders of the countries involved. Earlier this summer, the  Constitutional Court in Guatemala had blocked the President, Jimmy Morales, from signing the agreement without the approval of the national Congress. Morales, who will leave office in January, was trying to finalize the deal because “he wanted to end his time as close as he could to the U.S.,” someone with knowledge of the negotiations told me. (Members of his family were tried on corruption charges, but were cleared in August; Morales himself faced investigation for alleged campaign-finance improprieties, which he denied.) After the Court checked Morales, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the country, and Morales signed the agreement in direct contravention of the Court’s order. A few weeks later, in August, Guatemala held the second round of its Presidential [elections](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-administrations-self-defeating-policy-toward-the-guatemalan-elections). The winner was Alejandro Giammattei, a right-wing  former national-prison director, who had publicly opposed the safe-third-country deal but has privately assured the U.S that he will allow it to proceed, according to someone with knowledge of his position. In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele was seemingly so eager to curry favor with the Trump Administration that he accepted the deal without bothering to push for significant concessions. There are currently two hundred thousand Salvadorans living in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status, which the Trump Administration has tried to cancel. According to another senior Administration official, Bukele signed the deal even though the U.S. refused, outright, to extend T.P.S. for these Salvadorans. \n\nThere is a crisis facing the U.S. asylum system, and it’s been decades in the making. But ending asylum as we know it creates a crisis all its own. González, the Honduran pastor, is now living two hours outside of Ciudad Juárez, in northern Mexico. Her mother, husband, and children are in the U.S.; a nephew who’d also been in Tapachula is joining her; and she’s hired a lawyer to review her asylum case. Gangsters in Honduras murdered six of her family members over the past two decades, including two of her brothers. She has no more family left in the country. “They’ve all been killed or driven out,” she said. Earlier this year, after the U.S. deported her, she stayed with the closest person she had there to a relative—the mother of another asylum seeker whom she had met in detention, in El Paso.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b81ab3335f580f222","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Honduras","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"honduras"},{"id":"5c2e1f9caef5062c9d94aba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guatemala","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guatemala"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a7e716b454591ae79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Salvador","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-salvador"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

The accused were Eric Smokes, who was nineteen, and his best friend, David Warren, who was sixteen. Smokes and Warren insisted that they were innocent, but prosecutors charged them with murder. After several other teen-agers testified against them at trial, a jury convicted them. Warren spent almost twenty-one years in prison; Smokes was in prison for nearly twenty-five years.\n\nIn 2017, Warren and Smokes filed a motion in State Supreme Court to vacate their convictions. The Manhattan D.A., Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., has fought to keep the men’s convictions intact, and this battle has played out in a Manhattan courtroom, in a hearing held over eleven months which included ten days of testimony. The judge in the case, Stephen Antignani, is expected to announce his decision on October 31st—but the D.A.’s office appears to have lost track of some of its own files from 1987, which contain a significant piece of evidence. \n\nMany of the same people who testified against Smokes and Warren in 1987 have returned to the witness stand to testify at the recent hearing. One is Kevin Burns, who was nineteen at the time of the crime. Two weeks later, the police arrested Burns for an unrelated robbery, and while in police custody, he announced that “he was a witness to the Homicide of the Frenchman in Manhattan on New Years’ Day,” as a detective later wrote in a memo. At the murder trial, in the summer of 1987, Burns testified that he had seen Smokes punch the victim.\n\nBut at the first date of the court hearing, last November, Burns, now fifty-two, recanted on the witness stand. “Everybody has something in their life they are ashamed of doing, and they get a chance to rectify the situation,” he said. “This is my lie that I get to rectify from thirty years ago.” Burns testified that he had not seen Smokes punch anyone that night. He said that he had not even been in Manhattan on New Year’s Eve. “I wasn’t there,” he said. “I lied about everything.” Burns explained that he had known Smokes when they were teen-agers, that he had once shot Smokes by mistake with a pellet gun while aiming for someone else, and that the two had not got along. “I hated him,” Burns said.\n\nAt the time of the murder trial, Burns was on Rikers Island, waiting to be sent upstate to serve a prison sentence. “Anything I said on the stand was a total fabrication because I felt I was in jeopardy with the D.A.,” he said. “I didn’t know it was a crime to lie under oath.” He recalled an exchange that he had before he took the witness stand at the trial with a man he called “the guy with the badge.” “He told me that if I testify against Smokes, he can make my life better,” Burns said. After Burns testified, he recalled, the man asked, “&nbsp;‘Do you smoke?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘We know you are going upstate, so you are going to need some cigarettes. We got Camels and we got Marlboros.’ He gave me a whole carton of Marlboros. He took it inside the prison and gave it to me.” \n\nAt the original murder trial, prosecutors had built their case in large part on the testimony of four young men who claimed that they had been at the crime scene and could identify the defendants. Two of those witnesses—Burns and one other—testified at the recent hearing that they had lied thirty-two years earlier. (The other two witnesses did not testify at the hearing.) Vance’s office has sought to undermine the credibility of the two witnesses who recanted, arguing that they were telling the truth in 1987 but are now lying. In a lengthy memo submitted to the court this summer, Vance’s office attacked Burns, writing that his “claims sound so much like a cheap novel because that is what they are—bad fiction.”\n\nThe memo, signed by Christine Keenan, the veteran prosecutor who has been defending Smokes and Warren’s convictions in court, disputed Burns’s claim that he had been given a carton of cigarettes after he testified at the murder trial. She pointed out that when the lead detective on the case, George Delgrosso, the lead prosecutor, Michael Goldstein, and another prosecutor testified at the hearing, they “all denied promising or providing Burns with a carton of cigarettes.” \n\nGoldstein, who left the D.A.’s office in 1990, was called to the witness stand one morning last January, and Keenan questioned him about the matter of the cigarettes. “Did you ever hear an investigator or Detective Delgrosso tell Mr. Burns that you would give him and allow him to smuggle a carton of cigarettes back into prison?” she asked. “I don’t remember hearing that at all,” Goldstein said. \n\nMore than a year elapsed between when Smokes and Warren filed their motion in court and the first date of the hearing. “This case has been thoroughly reinvestigated,” Keenan told the judge, last December. “We just came to the conclusion that they are not actually innocent.” It emerged, however, that she had not seen the police file of the murder investigation before the hearing began. She had asked an investigator to fetch it from the police precinct, she told the judge, and after being informed that it wasn’t there, she had gone looking for it herself. Last December, she reported that she had finally found the file “because I personally crawled through a disgusting basement in the police precinct.”\n\nKeenan appears not to have known about the existence of another file: a tattered legal envelope filled with Goldstein’s files that had been sent to the Municipal Archives. When I found it there recently, the envelope contained numerous manila folders with crime-scene photos, witness statements, and notes about the case that Goldstein had handwritten on legal pads. Buried inside a file marked “Witnesses,” there was also an expense report he had filled out for costs related to the trial. One expense, for $17.41, was for “cigarettes and soap for inmate.” The attached receipt, which was from a pharmacy near the courthouse, was dated July 8th—the same day that Burns testified. \n\nThe Municipal Archives are located less than five blocks from the D.A.’s office, but it appeared that nobody from the D.A.’s office had retrieved the file. Meanwhile, Smokes and Warren, who both reside in Brooklyn, have been trekking into Manhattan for each court date. When their hearing started, last fall, they were both working manual-labor jobs: Smokes in construction, and Warren removing asbestos in schools. They are now middle-aged—Smokes is fifty-two, Warren forty-nine—and earlier this year Smokes underwent knee-replacement surgery. Afterward, he tried to find a less gruelling job than construction and applied to drive for Uber, but he was rejected, he said, because of his conviction.\n\nWhen I called Goldstein this week to ask if he thought that Smokes and Warren might not be guilty of the crime they served time for, he declined to answer, “because the motion is presently pending before the court, and the judge has not yet made a decision.” When I mentioned Kevin Burns and the expense report, he said, “Giving someone cigarettes? I don’t think that’s something of great moment to give someone cigarettes.” When I contacted Vance’s spokesperson, Danny Frost, he gave a statement that he said is the D.A.’s policy on all such cases: “our office will thoroughly review any documents or information brought to our attention.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c882bfcc72cd92d0544","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c882bfcc72cd92d0544","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Criminal-Justice

Most people whose lives end on Rikers die of natural causes, but there is no doubt that some deaths there have been caused by the culture and conditions of Rikers itself. This tally of preventable deaths includes: Jason Echevarria, twenty-five, who swallowed a packet of soap in his cell, screamed in agony for hours, and died after guards refused to take him to the medical clinic; Carlos Mercado, forty-five, a diabetic in desperate need of insulin, who collapsed in a hallway his first day in jail; Ronald Spear, fifty-two, a kidney-dialysis patient, who died after being kicked in the head by a guard.\n\nEvery year, several thousand people across the country die while imprisoned. Local officials report the number of deaths to the Department of Justice, but very little attention is paid to the question of how many of these deaths could have been prevented. Several years ago, Homer Venters, a physician and the former chief medical officer for New York City’s Correctional Health Services, sought to answer this question. Between 2010 and 2016, there were a hundred and twelve deaths in New York City jails. Venters and his team found that ten to twenty per cent of those deaths each year were “caused by actions taken inside the walls” of a jail. He calls these “jail-attributable deaths,” and writes that some years the percentage of such deaths “rose to half or more.” \n\nReporters have virtually no access to the jails on Rikers Island, but, for many years, Venters had a rare vantage point from which to observe its inner workings. He started working on Rikers in 2008, overseeing health care for thousands of people imprisoned there. On an island known for abuse and violence, Venters became a legendary figure; he often spoke about human rights and was known for his persistent advocacy on behalf of inmates. He left the city’s jail-health service in 2017, and now he has written a crucially important book, “[Life and Death in Rikers Island](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Rikers-Island-Homer-Venters/dp/1421427354),” in which he examines one of the most overlooked aspects of mass incarceration: the health risks of being locked up.\n\nEight jails now operate on Rikers, each with its own medical clinics, where incarcerated people go if they feel sick or need follow-up care, often for diseases like diabetes or asthma. But part of what makes jails such health risks for the people confined there is the insidious way that the environment undermines the ability of medical staff to perform their jobs. In 2013, officials at Rikers stopped allowing incarcerated people to walk to clinics alone; now a guard had to escort them—and, suddenly, inmates were missing their appointments nearly half the time. Venters writes, “We would give security staff list after list of the ‘must see’ patients whom we feared might die without receiving care.” This strategy worked, but only temporarily. “We might make a brief improvement,” he writes, “and then a friendly deputy warden would be promoted, transferred, or fired, and we would fall back to half or fewer of our patients being produced.” Although the situation has improved, the problem persists.\n\nThe culture clash between guards and medical staff on Rikers was apparent even in the way that the two groups spoke about the people confined there: guards called them “inmates,” while medical workers called them “patients.” At times, medical staff found themselves caught in an ethical dilemma: Was their primary loyalty to their patients or to the system in which they work? This conundrum is known as “dual loyalty,” and Venters writes that, on Rikers, the “most dramatic and tortured aspect of dual loyalty” involves the role that medical staff play in sending people to solitary confinement. Jail managers who wanted to lock an individual in solitary first had to obtain “clearance” from a mental-health worker—assurance that the inmate would not harm himself if isolated for twenty-three hours a day. Venters is a fierce critic of the process. “Health clearance for solitary is not based on any reliable science and violates basic medical ethics because, of course, that patient is supposed to suffer,” he writes. “It’s punishment, after all.” \n\nRikers has long been notorious for its culture of brutality, and, soon after Venters started working there, he sought to determine exactly why so many inmates were being injured. The main cause of injuries was fights with other incarcerated people, but the secondary cause—accounting for about a quarter of injuries—was listed as “slip and falls,” according to official records. Venters and his team developed an injury-surveillance system, with drop-down menus where medical staff could document how and where the injuries had occurred. Soon a pattern of abuse by guards emerged—and the prevalence of slip and falls made more sense. If an incarcerated person had his nose broken by an officer’s fist, he was unlikely to tell the truth when brought to the medical clinic; fearing retaliation from guards, he might instead say that he had slipped in the shower.\n\nVenters began combing this electronic database each week, identifying patients whose records showed that they had “sustained serious injuries during an interaction with correctional officers,” or whose stories of how they got hurt did not match their injuries (“like a jaw fracture from falling on a toilet”). “Then, at about 5:00 pm on Fridays, I would take my list and go to the jails where these patients were being held,” he writes. At that hour, he knew that he’d be able to move around with more freedom and less scrutiny, and he always made a point of wearing his stethoscope. But, he writes, “Within a few weeks of starting these Friday night encounters, the inmates and DOC [Department of Correction] staff alike came to recognize that I was coming to these housing areas and intake pens for reasons that went beyond simple checkups.” He continues, “Correctional officers would stiffen and slow-walk my requests to see patients. In some instances, officers would outright refuse to produce patients for me to see.” \n\nSometimes, Venters would encounter a patient whose injuries were more serious than the medical staff had initially thought, and he would try to correct the record. But when he would send an e-mail to D.O.C. officials asking to upgrade an injury, he recalls that he would get back “a flood of responses” intended to derail his efforts. Venters recounts one visit from a D.O.C. investigator “with zero clinical training” who “tried to poke holes” in his diagnosis. “Her challenging of my clinical assessment that a patient had suffered a nasal fracture was maddening,” he writes. “But had I been one of our hundreds of physician assistants or physicians”—instead of a senior official—“the message would have been clear: this isn’t a path you want to go down.” \n\nTo conceal the extent of the abuse toward inmates, Venters discovered, guards would sometimes hide individuals with suspicious injuries in remote jail cells. Venters describes receiving a call one day from a doctor who reported that guards had just beaten a patient in a waiting area at a clinic and that “the patient had been dragged away without receiving care and had not been seen since.” Venters went searching for him. “After failing to find him in any of the normal hiding spots in this jail, I went to another facility where ‘problematic’ patients were often sent,” he writes. “I found him in a remote part&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and heard him sobbing before I saw him in his cell.”\n\nEven more haunting is a story Venters recounts about a night, in December, 2012, when officers attacked incarcerated people *inside* a clinic. The next morning, Venters found a doctor there beginning her work shift by wiping blood off of cabinet doors. The night before, guards had brought in two young men, restrained on gurneys, then “yelled at the medical staff to get in the back of the clinic, after which the beatings began,” Venters writes. “I got the stories of several staff, some of whom made it clear they would not repeat their observations to others out of fear for their own safety.” But Venters did find one employee who was willing to relay details of the beatings to his boss, Dr. Tom Farley, who was then the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health. Venters writes, “She said something to Dr. Farley that revealed the normalization of abuse in jails: ‘I’m new here and I didn’t know that when this happens, we’re supposed to go in the back and stay out of the way.’” \n\nThe *[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/nyregion/rikers-study-finds-prisoners-injured-by-employees.html)* investigated the incident, in 2014, and the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York mentioned it in a report that year about Rikers, but no criminal charges were filed against the officers. Meanwhile, the worker who spoke up endured retaliation. “She was verbally harassed by DOC staff and started to receive calls from currently incarcerated patients to her cell phone,” Venters writes. “Despite our best efforts to create a safe work environment by transferring her to alternate facilities, she left her job shortly thereafter.” Medical workers told Venters that after speaking up about other incidents, they, too, faced retaliation, including “slashed tires” and “dead flowers on their computers.” \n\nLate one night, during the same month that the clinic beatings occurred, Ronald Spear, a kidney-dialysis patient, at the North Infirmary Command repeatedly demanded to see a doctor. He was feeling ill and, around 5 *A.M.*{: .small}, he snuck out of his dorm to go to the medical office next door. A jail guard named Brian Coll stopped him. The doctor on duty said that he was busy and Spear would have to wait. Then Coll and Spear got into a scuffle. Two other guards pinned Spear to the floor, following the usual procedure. But the incident did not end there; while Spear was restrained, Coll repeatedly kicked him in the head. Spear died minutes later. When Venters arrived later that day, D.O.C. investigators and a homicide detective were present, and Spear’s body was still on the floor. \n\nVenters doesn’t write about Coll’s subsequent criminal prosecution, but, at Coll’s trial, in 2016, three medical staff took the witness stand. Their testimony revealed Rikers’ unofficial rule about medical workers averting their eyes when guards have a physical altercation. Despite the commotion in the hallway outside the medical offices—which one person said sounded like “bodies hitting the ground”—the nurse on duty did not investigate. “I opened the door and I immediately closed it,” she said. The doctor on duty testified that he did not open his office door or peer out the window. Instead, he remained seated at his desk, where, he said, he was trying “to finish my paperwork” before his overnight shift ended. Eventually, a captain knocked on the door and asked the doctor to evaluate Spear, who was lying face down, wrists cuffed behind his back. “He was right in front of the door,” the doctor testified. “He has no pulse.”\n\nThe usual response to preventable deaths that occur inside a jail is to pin the blame on a few rogue guards (or incompetent medical workers), but Venters argues that the truth is far more complicated. “Because jails are chaotic and concealed from outside view, we only become aware of them when very bad outcomes occur, such as deaths,” he writes. “As a result, our periodic glimpses into this area miss the systemic failings of the systems we’ve designed, and we make the repeated error of blaming individuals for outcomes that we’ve essentially predetermined.” \n\nAccording to Venters, these systemic failures include not only Rikers’ culture of brutality but also something more surprising: guards used “paper logbooks” to record when an inmate arrives and leaves a housing area, which meant that the medical staff did not always know where their patients were located. There were times when an incarcerated person would be “moved from one spot to another without any new information being entered into the security system,” Venters writes. As a result, “medical, mental health, pharmacy, and nursing staff” would be forced “to roam the halls of the jails every day physically looking for their patients.” Jail officials have begun trying to track inmates with wristbands, but the paper logbooks are still in use, and, in Venters’ view, this “archaic paper-based approach to information management&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;may be the single greatest contributor to abuse and neglect in the jails.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio has promised that Rikers Island will eventually be closed, and, in preparation, New York City has been working to reduce the number of people held in its jails. In January, de Blasio announced that the jail population “had dropped to less than eight thousand people for the first time in almost forty years.” Now the number of guards on the city’s payroll actually exceeds the number of incarcerated people. But Rikers’ culture of brutality persists, and many of its jails are falling apart. “The medical infirmary was literally the DOC bus garage before they decided to upgrade their bus fleet to another site and hand the space over to us for our sickest patients,” Venters writes. “I’ve often heard complaints about inmates who would file lawsuits about bits of the ceiling material falling down on them, but the scope of the problem became clear to me when we received a report that a rotting animal carcass had fallen into the patient area.” \n\nIn the end, Venters places the blame for the “slow-rolling disaster” of the city’s jails at the very top, with City Hall. New York City, “like many cities and counties,” he writes, “turned its back on jail conditions for years, and a culture of mismanagement and brutality took hold that has not been removed.” He makes few distinctions between de Blasio and his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. “Having led the health service across two mayoral administrations, one a centrist Republican and the other a progressive Democrat,” Venter writes, “I have seen remarkable consistency in how the incompetence of the correctional service was not only tolerated but also supported.” Now, with “Life and Death in Rikers Island,” Venters reveals the true human cost of these colossal management failures.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7a81ab3335f580f25d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rikers Island","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rikers-island"},{"id":"5c2e1f44b75f002c8941e6e3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jail","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jail"},{"id":"5c2e206b425c632c6cd708a5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Book","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"book"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7ee7fe02cbd163370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Health","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"health"}],"sections":[{"id":"5af46dde7505432fc35f6232","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Under Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"under-review"}]},"channel":"Books","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8ac6c4c222f03a82ea4","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jennifer Gonnerman has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015.

They left their apartment in the Ida B. Wells Homes, a housing project on the South Side of Chicago, to meet her partner, Ben Baker, outside the building. They found him talking with a police sergeant named Ronald Watts, a notorious figure in the project. Watts oversaw a team of police officers who were supposed to be rooting out the project’s drug trade, but he was in fact running his own “criminal enterprise,” as another officer later put it. Watts extorted money from drug dealers and other residents, and when they didn’t pay him he fabricated drug charges against them. That morning, Ben said, the sergeant had tried to shake him down. Ben told him, “Man, fuck you. Do your motherfucking job,” before walking away.\n\nClarissa and Ben, who were both in their early thirties, had been together since they were teen-agers. For seven years, they had lived with their sons in the Wells, as the project was known. Ben had grown up there and was used to dealing with hostile, sometimes corrupt officers, but Clarissa, whose father had been a private detective, expected better treatment from the police. In the months after Ben’s confrontation with Watts, whenever she saw a police officer talking to Ben she intervened, marching up to the officer and saying, “What’s going on?” One time, as Clarissa approached, an officer said to Ben, “Here comes your lawyer.”\n\nOn the afternoon of March 23, 2005, Clarissa saw from a window in their apartment that several officers had detained Ben, and she followed them to the police station. According to the police report, the officers had caught Ben with packets of heroin in one hand and packets of crack cocaine in his pocket. Prosecutors charged him with drug possession with intent to sell. Ben, who was unemployed and watched the boys after school, had a history of selling drugs, and he was three weeks away from finishing a two-year probation sentence for a drug case. If he was convicted of the new charges, he faced up to sixty years in prison. On April 2nd, he was released from jail pending trial. Clarissa, who worked as an administrator at a home-health-care agency, picked him up.\n\nBen said that Watts had framed him. Clarissa believed him, and so did his lawyer, Matthew Mahoney, who had represented him in a previous case, and had worked in the nineties as a prosecutor in the public-corruption unit at the Cook County state’s attorney’s office. In May, Mahoney accompanied Clarissa and Ben to the state’s attorney’s office, where they met with two police sergeants, an agent from the Chicago Police Department’s internal-affairs division, and a prosecutor named David Navarro. Clarissa and Ben assumed that the authorities would be surprised to hear about Watts’s conduct, but they held up one photo after another of Watts’s team. “It was, like, Do you know who this is? Do you know who this is?” Clarissa recalled. “They were already investigating.”\n\nThe state’s attorney’s office opened an investigation into Watts after Mahoney informed the office of Ben’s case. The police department was known for consistently failing to address officer misconduct. In the previous two years, although the department had received at least twenty-five complaints about Watts and his team—including allegations that they planted drugs on people—it allowed them to continue working in the Wells. Mahoney described the internal-affairs division as “notoriously, incredibly slow in doing anything—and they’re incredibly full of leaks.” As a prosecutor, he said, he never knew whether “they’re going to leak your investigation to the target.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5aff48c1a4522d60ea3428f6]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nThat summer and fall, Watts continued to harass Ben and Clarissa. In October, Clarissa visited the police department’s Office of Professional Standards twice to file complaints. According to police records, she reported that Watts “entered and searched her house on several dates without justification,” and “threatened to take her to jail.” (Watts, through an attorney, declined to be interviewed for this article.) Clarissa did not know it at the time, but the police department did not protect the identities of citizens who filed complaints. Instead, before interviewing officers, the department told them the name of the complainant.\n\nOne Sunday in December, Ben was at home, planning to watch the Bears play the Steelers, when Clarissa called, asking him to pick her up at her aunt’s house. Returning home, as they drove into the parking lot next to the Wells, Watts and one of his officers pulled up behind them. They demanded Ben’s keys, and started searching the car. Finally, Watts reached inside the driver’s-side door and shouted, “I got it!” Clarissa said she saw Watts take something out of his sleeve, and she and Ben both recalled what Watts said next: “Put the cuffs on him—and you can lock her ass up, too.”\n\nBoth Ben and Clarissa were charged with drug possession with intent to sell. Clarissa had never been arrested before, and set out to prove that she and Ben had been framed. That turned out to be far more difficult than she had expected. Ben was convicted and imprisoned, while Clarissa reluctantly pleaded guilty in exchange for a probation sentence. During the next ten years, she struggled to raise their sons alone, suffered from depression, and at times was unemployed. But she kept at it, and her and Ben’s efforts started a chain of events that, last fall, led the state’s attorney’s office to dismiss the convictions of fifteen men who had been arrested by Watts’s team. The director of the office’s Conviction Integrity Unit told reporters, “The police were not being truthful,” and “in good conscience we could not see these convictions stand.”\n\nJoshua Tepfer, an attorney at the University of Chicago Law School’s Exoneration Project, has represented Ben since 2015\\. He called the dismissal of the convictions “the first mass exoneration in Cook County history.” As cities across the country reckon with cases of police misconduct and corruption going back years, judges have begun to throw out large groups of convictions. In 2014, Philadelphia police officers were indicted on charges that included robbing and assaulting citizens, leading prosecutors to seek the dismissal of more than a thousand convictions. After Baltimore police officers were indicted on racketeering charges last year, judges threw out about three hundred convictions; more than a thousand other cases are under review. In Chicago, Tepfer believes that Watts and his officers wrongly arrested hundreds of people. He now represents sixty-three of them, and he is hopeful that there will be at least one more round of exonerations this year. “Clarissa is the lifeblood of this movement,” Tepfer said. “She started it ten years ago, and tried to report it so many ways, and tried so many times to save her family’s life.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe Ida B. Wells Homes were Chicago’s first housing project for African-Americans. Named after the South Side’s investigative journalist and anti-lynching crusader, the project opened in 1941, promising decent, affordable housing and a path to middle-class life to families that had left the South during the Great Migration. By the end of the first year, sixteen hundred families lived in row houses and walkups spread across nearly fifty acres, with a field house, a large park, and a community center.\n\nIn the next two decades, the Chicago Housing Authority doubled the population of the Wells, adding ten seven-story buildings, known as the Wells Extensions, and four fourteen-story buildings, called the Clarence Darrow Homes. At the same time, it put up more than twenty-five other projects, many of them high-rises in African-American neighborhoods. By 1970, some twelve thousand families were living in public housing on the South Side. In subsequent years, federal budget cuts and local mismanagement contributed to the projects’ decline, making them less desirable to working-class families. More poor families moved in, many of them led by single parents.\n\nBen’s mother raised him and two daughters in the Wells during the seventies and eighties. He met his father only a few times. When he was young, he and his friends played in tunnels beneath the buildings, which they entered by lifting grates on the street. “That was like our clubhouse,” he recalled. “We used to shoot at the rats with our slingshots.”\n\nLiving conditions there continued to worsen. In 1985, a bullet pierced the window of an apartment, hitting a thirteen-year-old boy in the head. Paramedics got trapped in a stalled elevator with the boy, and he later died at the hospital. A _Sun-Times_ reporter who visited the Wells the following year found garbage chutes clogged with trash, hallways with broken lights, and urine-soaked stairwells.\n\nDuring those years, crack use spread in the Wells, and Ben’s mother became an addict. He spent his first year of high school with an aunt in Milwaukee. When he returned to Chicago, he had trouble obtaining his transcript and never reënrolled in high school. Like many other teen-agers in the projects, he said, he had to fend for himself: “When they come looking for their mother, they find her in a smokehouse.” In 1989, when Ben was seventeen, he was arrested twice on drug charges and sentenced to probation.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cneembed: script/video/5afd9dfbdbc8587eba000010.js?autoplay=0]|||\n**Watch “The Backstory”:**\nJennifer Gonnerman on Chicago&#8217;s mass exoneration.\n|||\n+++\n\nClarissa grew up half a mile from the Wells, in very different circumstances. Her parents—Clarence, who worked at a detective agency run by a former police officer, and Florence, a stay-at-home mother—owned a three-story house with a winding staircase. They sent Clarissa, her sister, and her two brothers to Catholic school. Clarissa never visited the Wells. “My parents kept us from that world,” she said. “The only thing I heard about was shootings, poverty—nothing good.”\n\nClarissa, who was a shy and sheltered teen-ager, met Ben in 1990, when they enrolled in the same South Side night school. She had been attending a Catholic girls’ school on the West Side but left after her junior year. There were few African-American students, and, Clarissa said, “I think we had it harder.” Boys had thrown bottles at Clarissa as she waited for her mother to pick her up, and a student had used a racial epithet in her presence to describe Harold Washington, Chicago’s first black mayor.\n\nOne evening at night school, Clarissa arrived late to class and sat behind Ben. Later, he invited her to join him at his table in the cafeteria, and then offered her a ride home with some of his relatives, who were also students. They headed up State Street, through a four-mile stretch of high-rise housing projects, and stopped in front of Stateway Gardens. “I was nervous,” Clarissa recalled. “It was dark, and there were a lot of people outside.” When they stopped at her house, she invited everyone to come in. Ben said, “Then she goes into the kitchen with her sister, and she comes back with all these glasses, with all this crushed ice and 7 UPs, offering everyone drinks.”\n\nBen and Clarissa started dating. Ben had a playful, easygoing way about him, and, Clarissa recalled, “My mother right off liked him.” Her father was more standoffish, but, she said, “as time went on, he began to love him.” She gave birth to their first son, Ben, Jr., in 1991, a month before her twentieth birthday. Gerard followed in 1992, and Deon in 1993\\. (Ben also had two other children.) Clarissa and the boys lived with her parents, while Ben lived at his aunt’s apartment nearby.\n\nA month before Deon was born, Ben was arrested for shooting another young man, and charged with attempted murder. He spent the next four years in prison. If Clarissa’s parents were upset about the situation, they didn’t show it, she said, “I guess because we had the kids.” Several months before Ben was released, in 1997, Clarissa rented a three-bedroom apartment in the Wells Extensions for the family, for less than two hundred dollars a month. Her father offered to buy her a house elsewhere, but she refused. “I didn’t want to depend on my dad’s finances,” she said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nClarissa tried to improve the apartment—putting up wallpaper in the kitchen and sheer curtains in the living room—but it was hard to disguise the building’s state of neglect. When tenants left, the housing authority at times just boarded up the empty apartments. Three years before Clarissa and her sons moved in, two boys, aged ten and eleven, had dropped a five-year-old named Eric Morse from the window of an abandoned fourteenth-floor apartment in the Darrow Homes. For many, Eric’s murder confirmed that Chicago’s housing projects, with their squalor, drug markets, and frequent shootings, were beyond repair. Standing near the spot where the boy had died, Henry Cisneros, President Clinton’s Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, told a crowd of reporters and residents, “It’s the shame of Chicago and the shame of America that people have to live like this.” The next year, the housing authority began demolishing the Darrow Homes, and, shortly afterward, it developed a ten-year plan to remake the city’s public housing, which included demolishing the high-rises.\n\nClarissa planned to leave the Wells as soon as she’d saved enough money to afford a better place. She started working as a sales associate at Filene’s Basement, and Ben looked after the boys. Every evening, she came home and cooked a full dinner, like the ones her mother had made. “She was so proper, with a big old smile on her face,” Ben’s sister Gale Anderson said. “She’d go to work, come home, be the wife.” The apartment became a gathering place for Ben’s family and friends. “When I cooked, I cooked for everybody,” Clarissa said. “You can be on drugs, you can be hustling, you can just pass by—everyone is welcome.” She was proud of her short ribs, fried chicken, and pot roast. “I wasn’t eating ramen noodles or meat in a can,” she said. “I’m not saying it is wrong, but I’m not giving you something that I’m not going to eat.”\n\nAfter the Darrow Homes were demolished, more drug traffic gravitated to the Extensions. People involved in the drug trade stood outside the buildings, shouting the names of the drugs being sold: “Xbox!” “Knockout!” “Renegade!” Others waited inside, where they frisked buyers, to make sure they weren’t undercover cops. When Clarissa’s brother Bryan Glenn visited her building, he said, there were “drug addicts and drug dealers standing in the hall, screaming up to the next level that someone is coming.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5aff48c1ea55d1047a3d0cfa]||||||\n+++\n\nSergeant Ronald Watts—who, like nearly everyone in the Wells, was African-American—had spent part of his childhood in the Darrow Homes, and he knew how to exploit the lawlessness of the housing project. At five-eleven and two hundred and forty pounds, he was an intimidating presence. Shaun James, who lived in the Extensions, often took part in the project’s dice games and carried a wad of bills in his pocket. He recalled Watts’s shakedown tactics: “He used to take us in the hallway one by one. ‘Man, how much money you got on you?’ ” James would pull out his cash and hand it to Watts, who would count it, then ask, “How much is your freedom worth to you?” Sometimes Watts would even itemize the costs of an arrest, including the bond payment. “Now, here it is, I’m charging you three thousand dollars for your freedom. What are you going to do?” Ben recalled that one of Watts’s officers once told him, “It would be cheaper to pay us instead of paying a lawyer, paying a bond.” To make his point, Watts sometimes brandished a bag of drugs. James said, “You knew if you ain’t paying him you was going to jail.”\n\nIn 2001, the movie “Training Day,” about a corrupt Los Angeles police detective named Alonzo Harris, was released, and some Wells residents started calling Watts “Alonzo.” In the climactic scene, Harris, played by Denzel Washington, threatens a group of men, saying, “I’m putting cases on all you bitches!” James recalled a day when Watts found out that someone had filed a complaint against him with the Office of Professional Standards. “This man came down there snapping like he was just watching ‘Training Day’ and thinking about us,” James said. “ ‘Y’all want to call O.P.S. on me? I’ll put cases on all you bitches!’ ”\n\nMichael Newman, who grew up in the Wells, said that the only defense against Watts was to “hope he’s in a good mood and not putting any drugs on you.” Newman, who is now a manager at a homeless shelter in the Chicago suburbs, went on, “Everyone was not a gangbanger. Everyone was not selling drugs. But everyone who was over there would be treated as such.” As he saw it, the attitude of Watts and some of the other officers was: “Everyone is guilty over here. They live in the projects, the slums. Who cares about these people? Who is going to believe your word over mine?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nNo one knows how many men Watts and his officers framed, in part because so many of them pleaded guilty. Watts’s officers at times planted such large quantities of drugs on Wells residents that they were charged with a Class X felony, the highest-level felony after first-degree murder. If the defendant went to trial and lost, he faced up to thirty years in prison. Phillip Thomas, who sold candy from a cart in the Wells, recalled that when he told his public defender that Watts’s officers had planted drugs on him, “she made it quite clear that she didn’t believe me and that my best bet was to plead guilty.” Ignoring her advice, he represented himself at trial. He lost, and was sentenced to six years. Shaun James told his public defender a similar story, and, he said, “She’s looking at me like I’m crazy. She said, ‘Ain’t no judge is ever going to believe that.’ ” James and his co-defendant, Taurus Smith, both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to two years’ probation.\n\nClarissa and Ben decided to fight the cases against them: Ben’s, from when he was arrested alone, and Ben and Clarissa’s, from when they were arrested together. They assumed that, because the state’s attorney’s office was aware of Watts’s corruption, it would eventually drop the charges against them. David Navarro, the prosecutor who met with Clarissa and Ben in the spring of 2005, told me that he believed them, and spent months investigating their claims about Watts, but he couldn’t prove the allegations. “It’s very difficult to prove a case when your only witness is the guy who has a pending case against him, and that guy has a criminal background,” he said.\n\nIn April, 2006, a Cook County prosecutor announced in court that she was ready to go to trial in Ben’s case. Around that time, Clarissa and Ben married, at City Hall. “He had been asking,” Clarissa said. “I wanted him to know I was going to be there.”\n\nOn May 23, 2006, Ben’s trial began, in a cavernous room at the Cook County courthouse, on the city’s West Side. Clarissa watched from the front row; Ben sat beside Mahoney. In Mahoney’s opening statement, he said bluntly, “Sergeant Watts likes cash, and by that I mean he takes bribes.” Ben took the witness stand and explained that, on the afternoon of his arrest, he had been coming down the stairs of his building when he passed two men selling drugs on a landing. A police officer appeared and ordered all three of them to put their hands on the wall.\n\n“Did you have any narcotics on you?” Mahoney asked.\n\n“No,” Ben said.\n\nA prosecutor called Watts and the three officers who had arrested Ben. One officer, Douglas Nichols, testified that Ben “was holding a clear plastic bag containing numerous smaller ziplock baggies containing white powder.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5aff48c1cd03646f0a9faab4]||||||\n+++\n\nAnother, Robert Gonzalez, seemed less certain, and the judge, MichaelP. Toomin, asked him for clarification: “You said that you didn’t see anything in Mr. Baker’s hand when you detained him, is that right?”\n\n“I didn’t have a view of what was in his hand until he came toward me,” Gonzalez said. But, after another officer detained Ben, Gonzalez said, “I caught a glimpse of the narcotics.”\n\n“Where was it?” Toomin asked.\n\n“In his hand, I don’t recall.”\n\nWhen Watts took the witness stand, Mahoney said, “Have you ever asked Mr. Baker to give you any money for any reason at any time?”\n\n“No,” Watts said.\n\nThe trial took less than two days, spread over two weeks. On June 9th, Toomin declared Ben guilty. Ben’s defense, he said, was “based solely on his testimony, his self-serving testimony,” and was “actually contradicted by credible evidence presented by a number of police officers.” Toomin later explained in court that he knew the state’s attorney’s office had investigated Watts, but noted that “nothing happened. It bore no fruition at all.” (Toomin declined to comment on the case.)\n\nAt Ben’s sentencing, Mahoney asked for “mercy”; Toomin gave Ben eighteen years. Afterward, Clarissa wrote to the judge, begging him to reconsider. She worked full time, she said, “while Ben is taking our boys to school and picking them up and helping them with their homework. Here are examples of how two African-American parents are active and involved in our kids’ productive lives.” Toomin reduced the sentence to fourteen years.\n\nBen was taken to Stateville Correctional Center, thirty miles southwest of Chicago. Three months later, on September 18, 2006, he was brought back to Toomin’s courtroom, to stand trial with Clarissa on their joint case. A prosecutor offered them a last-minute deal: if they both pleaded guilty, Clarissa would receive one year of probation, and Ben would get an additional four years in prison.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5aff48c15afd52751d284cf3]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nStanding before the judge, they quickly conferred. Clarissa wanted to take the case to trial—“In my mind I was, like, No, we’re going to fight, because I’m _innocent,_” she said—but Ben told her that they should take the plea deal. If they went to trial and were convicted, Clarissa would spend at least four years in prison. Who would take care of their boys? In tears, she pleaded guilty.\n\nJudge Toomin told them that he thought there was insufficient evidence “that these are renegade police officers,” but he assured them that if their accusations eventually proved true he would take action. “I would have no hesitation but to vacate all of the guilty findings, judgments, sentences, including the fourteen years you’re doing now.” At the end of the proceeding, Mahoney told the judge, “Ms. Glenn would like to hug Mr. Baker.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nClarissa was now the mother of three adolescent boys, with a full-time job and a husband in prison. Before Ben’s trial, they had found a house on the South Side, and she had obtained a Section 8 voucher to help pay the rent. But, with Clarissa’s felony conviction, she was no longer eligible for Section 8\\. She felt that in some ways her life was even more stressful than Ben’s. “I’m worried about him in there, I’m worried about us out here in the world. I’m worried about bills, I’m worried about income, I’m worried about food, I’m worried about safety—so I’m twice as worried,” she said. She tried to hide her feelings from their sons. But Ben, Jr., who is now twenty-six, told me, “We saw it—how much pain she was in.”\n\n“Every part of her was dying on the inside,” Clarissa’s brother Bryan recalled. “The person you love—that you wrapped yourself up in, that you made a huge bet on—is now in jail. You’re being ridiculed—family is ostracizing you. Not necessarily us, but other extended family. Now all of your business is out in the open. For a person like her, that is huge.” Clarissa told me, “I was mad and angry and had a lot of hate in me. And you’re not supposed to hate anyone, but these officers changed my entire being.”\n\nIn 2008, Ben was transferred to Pinckneyville Correctional Center, three hundred miles from Chicago, where he shared a cell and slept on the bottom bunk. He kept two photos of Clarissa in his Bible, and he stuck photos of his children in the mattress above him. “So when I go to sleep and wake up, they’re the first thing I see,” he said. Because Ben hadn’t known his father, he tried, with his own sons “to be there for them as much as I could,” he said. Now he missed Ben, Jr.,’s football games, and Gerard’s basketball games, and the day Deon won a cooking competition. Clarissa often visited Ben, but she could afford to bring the boys only twice a year.\n\nMeanwhile, the F.B.I., which had occasionally heard about Watts’s conduct, received new information in 2007 and undertook an investigation. A federal prosecutor named Thomas Shakeshaft began working with the Bureau to develop a case against Watts. “These cases take a long time to do, especially when you’re trying to nail a Chicago cop,” Shakeshaft said. The Watts case was particularly difficult, because the most likely informants were involved in the drug trade, a fact that a defense attorney could use to undermine their credibility at trial. “So you’ve got to have a bunch of coöperators and a bunch of deals,” Shakeshaft said.\n\nBy 2008, Clarissa had concluded that the only way to bring Ben home was to help law enforcement catch Watts taking a bribe. She contacted the Office of Professional Standards, she said, and was referred to the F.B.I., where she offered to help recruit informants. Shannon Spalding, a police officer who was working on the F.B.I. investigation, recalled, “Clarissa walked in these people. My partner and I would wire them up and send them out on missions.”\n\nOn several occasions, Clarissa said she saw an F.B.I. agent named Patrick Smith give marked money to an informant to pass on to Watts. Clarissa worked with Smith for about a year, she said, “and then all of a sudden it just fell to the wayside.” Spalding said that she was told by the F.B.I. that Smith had not been “following protocol,” and that the evidence he helped gather was “tainted.” Another agent took over the investigation, but Clarissa had no further contact with the Bureau. (The F.B.I. declined to answer any questions about the investigation. Smith did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAt the time that Clarissa stopped hearing from Smith, around 2009, the Chicago Housing Authority was still in the midst of its effort to demolish its largest housing projects, including all the buildings at the Wells. Residents were promised rental vouchers to help them relocate, but thousands of people—many of them afflicted with severe drug addictions and mental illness—remained in the abandoned buildings. Finally, in the fall of 2011, the last of the Wells came down. There was no plan for the squatters, who likely moved into homeless shelters, relatives’ homes, or onto the streets.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5aff48c14602d47019ff46b7]||||||\n+++\n\nA few months later, on the evening of February 13, 2012, Ben was lying on his bunk in Pinckneyville when someone shouted down the cellblock, telling him to turn on the TV. “Hey, Ben! They got Watts!”\n\nBen tuned in to the news and saw Watts running down the sidewalk, trying to evade television cameras. That morning, the F.B.I. had arrested him and one of his officers, Kallatt Mohammed, for stealing fifty-two hundred dollars from an F.B.I. informant posing as a drug courier. Watts and Mohammed had been charged in federal court with theft of government funds.\n\nBen stared at the television, taking in the news. His roommate was hollering, “You told me, man! You told me!” Ben wondered why Watts and Mohammed were the only ones arrested: “I’m, like, ‘Damn. Just them two?’ ”\n\nClarissa learned about the arrests late that night when she was watching the news, and thought that she would soon be notified of Ben’s release. But though the arrests were front-page news in Chicago, there does not appear to have been any reporting about the people who had been wrongly convicted, or an audit to find out how many were still in prison, or a push to reinvestigate their cases.\n\nClarissa wrote again to Judge Toomin, this time reminding him that he had promised to vacate their convictions if Watts were ever proved to be corrupt. “The reason I am bothering you is because I felt you are a fair judge and I trusted you,” she wrote. Toomin replied that “the Code of Judicial Canons preclude me from providing you any guidance in this matter.” Clarissa hired an attorney, who filed a petition to overturn Ben’s conviction, citing the arrests of Watts and Mohammed. But the state’s attorney’s office argued against reopening the case, and the petition was dismissed.\n\nClarissa attended a few of Watts’s court dates at the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago. If Watts and Mohammed were convicted, she thought, surely Ben would be released. In August, 2012, Mohammed pleaded guilty to theft of government funds. The following summer, Watts did, too. At Watts’s sentencing, federal prosecutors made clear that his criminal behavior far exceeded the crime for which he had been convicted. They asked the judge to sentence him to three years. She gave him twenty-two months.\n\nBen had been in prison for more than seven years. Clarissa couldn’t afford another attorney, so Ben persuaded a fellow-inmate, a jailhouse lawyer, to help him write a petition for a new trial, which Ben filed in January, 2014\\. A judge assigned his case to the state appellate defender’s office, and a lawyer there eventually referred it to the Exoneration Project. That November, attorneys there sued the F.B.I. to get its records on Watts, but while they waited to receive them there was no movement on his case.\n\nClarissa was overwhelmed by her family’s predicament. “Imagine your son sitting on the floor, holding a pillow, crying, saying he wants his dad,” she said. “They were young men growing up. So, a lot of things I feel they probably wanted to talk about or say, they didn’t say to me.” One day, when Deon was walking home from high school, someone pulled a gun on him and stole his money and cell phone. Soon afterward, Clarissa called Deon’s number from her office and got the usual monosyllabic answers: Did he make it home? Yeah. Did he have any homework? Yeah. Later, she discovered that she had been talking to the robber. If Ben had been home, she knew, he would have been able to tell the boys which streets were safe to walk on. “I was sheltered,” she said. “I can’t protect them like that.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5aff48c1a4522d60ea3428f8]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nIn late 2014, Clarissa was laid off from the home-health-care agency where she had worked for a decade. She looked for a new job, but she had a felony record; no matter how well the first interview went, she was not called back. Deon dropped out of college and moved home to help. “It was a spiral going down—mentally, financially, emotionally,” Clarissa said. “It was really, really tough.” Some days, she didn’t get out of bed. “I thought about suicide,” she said. “But then I was thinking, I didn’t want our boys to find me. If Ben wasn’t out, who was going to be there for them?”\n\nClarissa could barely afford Ben’s calls from prison, and when they spoke on the phone, she recounted, “He’s saying, ‘Don’t worry.’ Don’t worry! Don’t worry about what? Me not working? Your son getting stuck up coming home from school? It’s not that I’m getting angry. But I’m _angry_. I’m angry at him. Because how can you tell me not to worry?” She said, “I had tried everything, everything, to get him out.” Finally, after eight years, she gave up. That winter, she filed for divorce.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne day in September, 2015, Joshua Tepfer, of the Exoneration Project, who also worked at a civil-rights law firm, Loevy & Loevy, was handling a case for a colleague at the Cook County courthouse. It was a “nothing court date,” as Tepfer put it—he simply had to appear before the judge and set the next court date for the defendant, Ben Baker. While he was in the courtroom, he started reading Ben’s file. The moment he left the courthouse, he called the colleague. “Can I just make sure I understand this?” he asked. “So, he testified that he was framed, and then this cop was basically locked up for doing the same thing?” She told him that that was correct. “This is a great case,” he said. “Can I work on it?”\n\nTepfer knew that, to get Ben’s conviction thrown out, he would have to prove that Watts’s corruption was far more extensive than had been shown in court. He studied the F.B.I. records on Watts, and tracked down Shannon Spalding, the police officer who had worked on the investigation. After Watts was arrested, Spalding and her colleague Daniel Echeverria had filed a whistle-blower lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department. As Jamie Kalven reported, in a lengthy exposé in the Intercept, their supervisors labelled Spalding and Echeverria “rats” and forced them to spend weeks in an empty room at the training academy. (In 2016, the city agreed to pay them a settlement of two million dollars.)\n\nWhen Tepfer first tried to enlist Spalding in his efforts to free Ben, she had reservations, in part because her lawyers had advised her not to get involved. Spalding told me, “He was pitching Ben as a reformed person. I told Josh, ‘You do realize Ben Baker is a drug dealer?’ ” But in the end Spalding decided to help. “It doesn’t matter what you do,” she said. “You have to be found guilty of the crime _you_ commit. He shouldn’t be in prison.”\n\nOn December 15, 2015, Tepfer filed a thirty-two-page petition with the court, telling the “seemingly outlandish story of police corruption” that had led to Ben Baker spending nearly a decade in prison. Two days later, the Chicago _Tribune_ ran a front-page story about Ben’s case, saying that it “casts a spotlight on the police code of silence.” The following month, the state’s attorney’s office dropped the charges against Ben, and, at a brief hearing on January 14th, LeRoy K. Martin, Jr., the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Cook County circuit court, threw out his conviction. Afterward, the chief of criminal prosecutions in the state’s attorney’s office told a reporter, of Watts: “Now it’s a fact that he’s a corrupt and dirty police officer.”\n\nThat evening, Ben’s sister Gale picked him up at the Robinson Correctional Center, on the Indiana border, and drove straight back to their mother’s house, just outside Chicago. “Everybody was there waiting,” Gale said. “It was the most exciting day in the world.” The next day, Clarissa heard that Ben had visited Ben, Jr., and Deon at work. She was sitting at home, still unemployed, trying to decide, “Should I call him, or shouldn’t I call him?” They had not spoken in more than a year. Before she could make up her mind, she heard a knock on the door. “Can I get a hug?” Ben said. Clarissa recalled, “When he gave me that one hug, I didn’t want him to let go.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn March, 2016, a judge vacated Ben’s and Clarissa’s convictions from their arrest together. During the next two years, dozens of men who had lived or spent time in the Wells called Tepfer with stories about how Watts and his officers had framed them, too. Tepfer invited many of them to the Exoneration Project, in a converted loft building in Chicago’s gentrified West Loop. Shaun James, the dice player, came, and so did Phillip Thomas, the candy seller at the Wells, bringing a hundred pages of legal documents that he’d kept from his case, a decade earlier. Sean Starr, an attorney who helped Tepfer interview the men, told me, “A lot of them said that, to some degree, this ruined their life.”\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer named Kim Foxx was running an insurgent campaign for state’s attorney, promising “to bring back integrity to our criminal-justice system.” Foxx, who is forty-six, the same age as Clarissa, grew up in Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago’s most infamous housing project. When she was in high school, she told me, she toured the Cook County Jail with her classmates as part of a “scared straight” program. “It was horrible,” she said—overcrowded, with people sleeping on mattresses on the floor. She attended college and law school at Southern Illinois University, and later worked in the state’s attorney’s office.\n\nFoxx is personable, polished, and almost regal: she is nearly six feet tall, and when we met, in February, she was wearing three-inch black heels. She seemed to have little chance of defeating the incumbent, Anita Alvarez, until November, 2015, when city officials released footage of a police officer fatally shooting a teen-ager named Laquan McDonald. The shooting had occurred a year earlier, but Alvarez did not charge the officer with first-degree murder until the day the footage was released. Young activists launched an anti-Alvarez campaign, called “Bye, Anita.” Foxx said, “Sometimes it takes really jarring incidents to shock the consciousness of people about what elected officials should be doing.” She trounced Alvarez in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election. In December, 2016, Foxx was sworn in, the first African-American woman to serve as Cook County’s top prosecutor.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5aff48c1fd96b760b45cd3db]||||||\n+++\n\nThe following September, Tepfer filed a petition with the court to vacate the convictions of Thomas, James, and thirteen other men. He included statements that the men had made following their arrests: trial transcripts in which they insisted they had been framed, motions filed by their attorneys making the same argument, complaints filed with the police department. Wrongful-conviction cases often drag on for years, but eight weeks after Tepfer filed the petition he received a call from Foxx’s office. Starr heard him shout into the receiver, “Are you serious?” Starr recalled, “I could hear in his voice that something incredibly monumental had just happened.”\n\nFoxx and her prosecutors asked Judge Martin to throw out the fifteen men’s convictions. The next morning, the men stood together before the judge as he did just that. One of them, a man named Leonard Gipson, who had pleaded guilty to drug charges and spent two years in jail, had three convictions overturned. He told reporters, “I’m just happy for me and my friends that someone gave us the opportunity to look at our cases and understand what Watts was really doing to us.” Foxx told me, “Any time I’m asked to sign off on the vacating of a conviction, there is that moment of thinking about what it means for the individual in that case. And then there is the pit in my stomach that is always, How many more are there? How many people are sitting in a cell? How many people are sitting at home with a conviction and can’t get a job based on a case that shouldn’t have been there?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn a Monday evening this past January, I visited Ben and Clarissa at their house on the South Side. They sat on a leather sofa in the living room, where a framed photo of them from around 2002 hung on the wall. After Clarissa’s felony record was erased, she had found work as a receptionist in a dentist’s office. When we met, Ben had just started the first job he’d ever held, as a machinist at a packaging company. We spoke for a few hours about their life in the Wells, their arrests, and their efforts to expose Watts. An hour or so into our conversation, Ben turned to Clarissa. “Are you all right? Why are you crying?”\n\n“Because it’s just living it, and knowing what I went through,” she said. “It was _not_ good.”\n\nWhen Ben was in prison, Clarissa said, she and the boys “didn’t really talk about it in the house.”\n\n“There wasn’t nothing to talk about,” Ben said. “I wasn’t there. They didn’t understand why I wasn’t there. So what was there to talk about?”\n\nSo far, Foxx’s office has thrown out thirty-two convictions of people who were arrested by Watts and his officers. But Watts and Mohammed were involved in about five hundred felony convictions between 2004 and 2012, and Tepfer believes that Foxx should overturn all of them, as well as the rest of the convictions tied to Watts’s team. “We can’t trust a single thing that happened in any of these cases,” he said. Foxx is more cautious. “We want to make sure we’re doing our due diligence,” she said. Last fall, the Chicago police superintendent placed on desk duty a sergeant and fourteen officers who worked with Watts. All of them remain on the police force.\n\nThe expanding scope of the Watts scandal continued to amaze Clarissa. “I just wanted to get Ben out,” she told me when I met with her and Ben. “I didn’t know it was going to get so huge.” Whenever there was a court date for the other “Watts victims,” as Tepfer calls them, she showed up to watch the proceedings. For her, the court dates provided a kind of release. “When I started coming to court, it felt like a vest came off,” she said. “It’s like a layer being constantly peeled off. Like you can breathe. You can breathe more and more.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThis spring, on the morning of April 10th, Tepfer was on his way home from a conference at Villanova University, outside Philadelphia, called Mass Exoneration and Ethics. As his flight landed in Chicago, he looked at his phone and saw he had several messages from Clarissa. She had been driving home from the gym when she saw unfamiliar cars parked outside her house.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5aff48c257c31b66bfbd9ff2]||||||\n+++\n\nShe kept driving, met Tepfer, and they went together to the house, where they found law-enforcement officers putting handcuffs on Gerard. A federal agent said that he also had an arrest warrant for Ben Baker. Tepfer called Ben at work and told him to come home, and they drove together to the federal courthouse downtown. Officers put Ben in shackles and took him to jail. He had been home a little more than two years.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Ben with four counts of “distributing a controlled substance”: selling heroin and fentanyl to a D.E.A. informant. According to the criminal complaint, the four alleged sales, each worth about four or five hundred dollars, had occurred during the day at Ben and Clarissa’s house, thirteen months after Ben got out of prison, before he found a job. In a separate federal criminal case filed that day, Ben’s friend Jamar Lewis, who had been part of the mass exoneration, was charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin. Gerard was charged in another heroin and fentanyl case, brought by the state’s attorney’s office. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTwo days later, Clarissa, Ben, Jr., and Deon went to the federal courthouse, with Ben’s mother, three of his aunts, a cousin, a niece, and a year-old grandniece, for a bail hearing. In a carpeted hallway outside the courtroom, the family held hands and bowed their heads, as one of Ben’s aunts led them in a prayer: “Lord, Ben needs you right now. Right now . . .”\n\nThey filed silently into the courtroom. Clarissa sat in the second row, wearing a white puffer vest. A door swung open, and everyone turned to watch Ben, in an orange jail uniform and leg irons, make his way to the front of the courtroom.\n\nBen’s new lawyer, Molly Armour, told the judge that Ben was on a “forward trajectory.” The president of the packaging company had sent a letter to the court, saying that Ben had been an “exemplary employee from the start,” who had “never been late to work even once.” He added, “I am truly hoping that he can return to work as soon as possible.” But to have any chance at release Ben needed someone to agree to supervise him.\n\n“Can I talk to the third-party custodian?” the judge, Mary M. Rowland, asked.\n\nClarissa walked to a wooden lectern.\n\n“How long have you known Mr. Baker?”\n\n“Twenty-seven years,” she said.\n\nThe judge asked, “Do you understand what it means to be a third-party custodian? In some sense, you are the eyes and ears of the court.” If Ben was released and broke any of the court’s rules—if he stayed out past curfew, or if he smoked marijuana—she would have to report him.\n\nThe judge continued, “What are your children doing?”\n\nClarissa was so nervous that she forgot the name of the sandwich shop where Ben, Jr., and Deon worked. “In a restaurant downtown,” she finally said. Just then, her grandniece ran to the front of the courtroom. Clarissa reached down and lifted her up. Once the judge finished with her questions, Clarissa returned to her seat, carrying the toddler.\n\nThe judge turned to Ben. “I’m very troubled that you get out in 2016 and a year later there are allegations you’ve engaged in this conduct,” she said. But, she added, “I’m very impressed by the letter from your employer.” She continued, “You’ve got a great job, and you’re doing a great job.” As it became clear that she was planning to release Ben, Clarissa’s shoulders relaxed and she exhaled. Deon, seated behind her, patted her back. It was a small victory. Ben faces up to thirty years on each count. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dec41c92e2c9b85dba3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mass Exonerations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mass-exonerations"},{"id":"5c2e1dec36cecf401921435c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Clarissa Glenn","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"clarissa-glenn"},{"id":"5c2e1cd3397f5b30646d066a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Police","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"police"},{"id":"5c2e1dec2396212cbb9fcaef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ben Baker","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ben-baker"},{"id":"5c2e1dec7e716b454591af10","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sergeant Ronald Watts","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sergeant-ronald-watts"},{"id":"5c2e1c8041e4c73c088d776d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chicago, Illinois","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chicago-illinois"},{"id":"5c2e1decb75f002c8941e5f9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Exoneration Project","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"exoneration-project"},{"id":"5c2e1dec81ab3335f580f2d3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Misconduct","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"misconduct"},{"id":"5c2e1dec7e716b454591af0f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Housing Projects","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"housing-projects"},{"id":"5c2e1cb44a08312cd3aa6c8a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wrongful Convictions","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wrongful-convictions"}],"sections":[{"id":"5910ee3a6c4c222f03a85a07","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from Chicago","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-chicago"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8ac6c4c222f03a82ea4","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jennifer Gonnerman has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015.

It was during the U.N. General Assembly, and a large Ukrainian delegation was in town. Parnas, who was born in Ukraine and grew up in Brooklyn, lives in Florida and runs an energy business with a Wall Street address. He was staying at the Trump International Hotel & Tower, just off of Columbus Circle, which has been his favorite hotel “from the first day it opened,” he told me. Parnas, a longtime fan of [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s real-estate businesses, was an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign for President. Now, after working on behalf of Trump’s lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani), to investigate Joe Biden and [his son Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), in Ukraine, Parnas and Fruman are at the center of the investigation that could result in the President’s impeachment.\n\nTwo days after the Speaker of the House, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), announced that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against Trump, potentially charging him with seeking to enlist the help of the Ukrainian government to damage Biden’s campaign, Parnas sat down with me at a table for two at Bouchon Bakery, near his hotel, and reminisced about his work as Giuliani’s fixer in Ukraine and elsewhere, where he collected dirt on the Bidens and the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie Yovanovitch. At our meeting, Parnas was accompanied by a bodyguard, who watched from a distance. “You can’t be too careful,” he said. He ordered a coffee and handed me a thick business card for Global Energy Producers, on which he is listed as the company’s C.E.O. and co-founder. (The Web site for the company now reads, “Looks Like You’re Lost.”) \n\nParnas had sat in on many of Giuliani’s phone calls and meetings involving Ukraine, he said, including one between Giuliani and an envoy of Volodymyr Zelensky, the new Ukrainian President, which took place in Madrid. Giuliani told me that, at this meeting, he received assurances that Zelensky’s administration would pursue several investigations sought by Trump, including one into the Bidens. Parnas was clearly proud of his work for Giuliani and seemed unfazed by his proximity to the impeachment inquiry. “I’m a businessman who obviously is close to the mayor, is close to the President,” he said. “I love the President. I love the Administration. I fully support him and honestly think he is going to go down as probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Presidents ever. What he’s doing is outstanding.” \n\nParnas was born in February, 1972, in the port city of Odessa, in southwestern Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. He was three when his family moved to the United States. “I came here as a legal immigrant, through a legal process,” he said. His family settled in Detroit, where they lived for about a year, before relocating to Brooklyn. When Parnas was sixteen, he worked at Kings Highway Realty, selling Trump Organization co-ops. “That was my first time knowing who Trump was, but, growing up in that area, you knew who Trump was, because his name was all over the place,” he said. \n\nIn 1995, when Parnas was twenty-three, he moved from Brooklyn to Florida. On visits to New York, he stayed at Trump properties. Parnas said that, until Trump announced his run for the Presidency, on June 16, 2015, he didn’t consider himself a Republican or a Democrat. “I was really never heavy into politics, never really contributed,” he said. Then, in June, 2015, Parnas’s teen-age son, Aaron, called his father. “Dad, I think one of your friends is running for President,” he joked. Aaron told me that, after Trump announced his candidacy, he called the Trump campaign to get passes to go with his father to a Trump rally in Florida. \n\nParnas soon became a regular at Trump’s rallies and other gatherings. “I started donating. We started to help raise money,” he said. Gradually, Parnas said that he got to know other Trump donors, including Tommy Hicks, Jr., a private-equity investor in Texas who is close to Donald Trump, Jr. (Hicks has since become the co-chair of the Republican National Committee.)“We became one big family,” Parnas said. “You got to understand, he didn’t have a real campaign, a traditional campaign. It was make-it-up, you know. Like him or not, you understand what it is. It was more, like, you know, we’d bump into each other constantly because it was all the same people, there were not that many of us.” Parnas told me that he “bumped into” Trump “plenty of times” at events in New York over the years, but that they didn’t get to know each other until the 2016 campaign. (Trump recently distanced himself from Parnas and Fruman, saying, “I don’t know those gentlemen. Now, it’s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody.”)\n\nOn Election Night, Parnas, along with other donors, including the Blackwater founder Erik Prince, were invited to attend a gathering with Trump and his family. “We were all there,” he recalled. “I will never forget that.” His go-to hotel in Manhattan, Trump International Hotel & Tower, was fully booked, so he stayed at the Intercontinental, where Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, and his family were watching the results come in. “We came home laughing and celebrating at three or four in the morning,” Parnas said. “The whole Democratic Party was at the hotel. It was quiet, pitch black.”\n\nParnas said that he grew closer to Giuliani after the election. “We were good friends, he’s also my counsel,” he said. “We were looking to do business together.” When Giuliani wanted to gather information in Ukraine to counter the findings of the special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, Parnas volunteered to help. “Because of my Ukrainian background and my contacts there, I became like Rudy’s assistant, his investigator,” he said. “I don’t do anything on my own. I don’t lobby people. I go get information. I set up a meeting. I make sure that the call went right. I make sure the translation is done right.” Parnas echoed the claims of Trump and Giuliani that the Democrats had worked with Ukrainians to dig up dirt on Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, ahead of the 2016 vote, seeming to imply that what he and Giuliani were doing now was little different. \n\nIn late 2018, Parnas said, he helped to connect Giuliani with the former Ukrainian prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was fired in 2016, by President Petro Poroshenko, after Biden and other U.S. and European officials complained that Shokin was lax in pursuing corruption. Biden, in particular, had threatened to withhold a billion dollars in loans that the Ukrainian government desperately needed. In a Skype call with Giuliani, Shokin falsely claimed that he was fired because he wanted to investigate Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, was on the board. Ukrainian and American officials said that Shokin, contrary to what he told Giuliani, did not actively investigate Burisma while he was prosecutor-general, and that the dormant cases in Ukraine that targeted Burisma—questioning how it obtained its exploration licenses and whether it paid all of its taxes—had nothing to do with Hunter’s role on the board. But Parnas said that he accepted Shokin’s claim that Biden had him fired to protect Hunter. In Parnas’s view, “Shokin basically stepped down, and allowed himself to get fired, to save the country.”\n\nParnas said that Giuliani wanted Shokin to travel to New York for a follow-up conversation. At Giuliani’s direction, Parnas spoke to Shokin about setting up his visit. “I said, ‘Listen, it’s going to be unofficial,’&nbsp;” he recalled. Shokin, who has a daughter living in California, told Parnas that he would seek a visa to visit her and would then meet Giuliani. Parnas said that Shokin was denied a visa. (Shokin did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAccording to Parnas, Giuliani helped him and Fruman get high-level meetings in Kiev, including by writing a letter of introduction to a minister in Zelensky’s government. Parnas and Fruman used the meetings to collect information that they hoped would be of interest to Trump, and to pitch energy deals for themselves. “We became a hot commodity. Past, present—everybody came with a story to tell,” Parnas recalled. “It’s like a movie, you’re hearing all these stories. You’re, like, are you kidding me?” Ukrainian officials told me that they were surprised by the indiscretion of Parnas and Fruman. A senior Ukrainian official said, of the two men, “They were looking to sell gas to Ukraine. They were looking for partners. Then, in the course of discussions, they were very open, I would say surprisingly open, about their plans to discredit Biden and to replace the Ambassador.”\n\nParnas told me that some of the Ukrainian officials and businessmen whom he met were distrustful of Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who started her posting in Kiev during President Obama’s second term. Parnas said he heard that she had been “badmouthing” Trump, saying that he would soon be impeached and that Ukrainian officials shouldn’t listen to him. Parnas said that he shared this information with the former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions and with Giuliani, who lobbied the State Department and Trump to remove the Ambassador. “I had a meeting with Pete Sessions that had nothing to do with that. It was about our gas company,” Parnas said. “In the meeting, Pete asked me, ‘Do you know anything about Yovanovitch?’ I told him what I heard. Unbeknownst to me, Pete was already looking into it, and when I left he opted to write a letter to [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo that day.” (After Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Sessions said in a statement that he would “vigorously defend myself against any allegations of wrongdoing.”) \n\nThe Trump Administration abruptly recalled Yovanovitch in May. Last week, in remarks to the three committees involved in the impeachment inquiry, Yovanovitch rebutted the rumors spread by Parnas and Fruman, saying that she served in her role “on a strictly nonpartisan basis.” She added, “Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen.”\n\nParnas, like many of the President’s most dedicated supporters, rejects the U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump. “It’s total bullshit,” he said. He described the Mueller investigation and the impeachment inquiry as “a modernized coup,” adding, “Before, you would use armies, guns. Now they use newspapers, television, the Internet, and media to be able to manipulate the crowd to such a point where whatever they say becomes the truth.” He ended our nearly ninety-minute meeting on a wistful note, saying that he looked forward to returning home to Florida and spending more time with his wife and son. “He’s the real story,” Parnas said, of Aaron. “My son graduated college at sixteen. He’s graduating law school at twenty. He’s about to be a lawyer. He’s doing some fascinating things. He wants to be President one day.”\n\nThe [federal indictment of Parnas and Fruman](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/rudy-giulianis-two-indicted-associates-could-have-a-lot-to-say) alleges that the two and other defendants engaged in “a scheme to funnel foreign money to candidates for federal and State office so that the defendants could buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates’ governments.” Since Parnas was arrested at Dulles with a one-way ticket to Vienna, it has emerged that he had been working as a translator with American lawyers representing Dmytro Firtash, one of Ukraine’s wealthiest businessmen, who has been battling extradition to the U.S. to face trial for bribery charges. Firtash has lived in Vienna for five years, but Parnas’s lawyer, John Dowd, told me that Parnas was not boarding a flight to Vienna to see Firtash when he was arrested. Dowd said that Parnas bought a one-way ticket because a round-trip fare, at the last moment, would have cost him nearly twenty thousand dollars.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d4a2bc86f2c9a244a83","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rudy

Some candidates’ memoirs tell stories of humble beginnings and of obstacles overcome; some describe searches for identity; some earnestly set out detailed policy agendas. Nearly all are relentlessly bland. In 2017, [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), a longtime senator from Delaware, [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama)’s Vice-President for eight years, and now a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, published an unusually raw memoir about the death, two years earlier, of his forty-six-year-old son, Beau, describing how it had threatened to undo him but ultimately brought his family closer. Beau, his father writes, was “Joe Biden 2.0,” a war veteran, a prosecutor, and a promising politician who “had all the best of me, but with the bugs and flaws engineered out.”\n\nIn the early months of the 2020 race, Joe Biden holds a lead over his many Democratic Party rivals, but he is hardly invulnerable. He is seventy-six and sometimes shows it. He often stumbles when defending his five-decade public history. Some voters will not easily overlook his support for the Iraq War, his treatment of Anita Hill and loose management of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, his handsy, close-talking behavior with women, or his descriptions of his “civil” working relationships with segregationist lawmakers. Even his admirers concede that he is prone to senatorial bloviation. What often seems to redeem him with voters, as a former senior White House aide put it recently, is “how he’s responded to tragedy and what he’s learned from it.”\n\nYet the family story that Biden tells in “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose” largely glosses over a central character in Biden’s life. Biden writes, “I was pretty sure Beau could run for President some day, and, with his brother’s help, he could win.” Hunter Biden, who is forty-nine, is described as a supportive son and sibling. In speeches, Biden rarely talks about Hunter. But news outlets on the right and mainstream media organizations, including the _Times_, have homed in on him, reprising old controversies over Hunter’s work for a bank, for a lobbying firm, and for a hedge fund, and scrutinizing his business dealings in China and Ukraine.\n\nThere is little question that Hunter’s proximity to power shaped the arc of his career, and that, as the former aide told me, “Hunter is super rich terrain.” But [Donald J. Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) and some of his allies, in their eagerness to undermine Biden’s candidacy, and possibly to deflect attention from their own ethical lapses, have gone to extreme lengths, promoting, without evidence, the dubious narrative that Biden used the office of the Vice-President to advance and protect his son’s interests.\n\nAt the same time, the gossip pages have seized on Hunter’s tumultuous private life. He has struggled for decades with alcohol addiction and drug abuse; he went through an acrimonious divorce from his first wife, Kathleen Buhle Biden; and he had a subsequent relationship with Beau’s widow, Hallie. He was recently sued for child support by an Arkansas woman, Lunden Alexis Roberts, who claims that he is the father of her child. (Hunter has denied having sexual relations with Roberts.)\n\nOn May 17th, the day before Hunter planned to appear at one of his father’s rallies, at Eakins Oval, in Philadelphia, [Breitbart News](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/who-is-steve-bannon-without-breitbart) published a story based on a Prescott, Arizona, police report from 2016 that named Hunter as the suspect in a possible narcotics offense.\n\nOnstage at the rally, Jill Biden introduced her husband. “The Biden family is ready,” she said. “We will do this as we always have—as a family.” Seated in white chairs to the side of the stage were Ashley Biden, Hunter’s half sister; Ashley’s husband, Howard Krein; Beau’s children, Natalie and Robert Hunter; Hunter’s three daughters, Maisy, Finnegan, and Naomi; and Naomi’s boyfriend, Peter. The last seat in the row, with a piece of paper on it that said “Reserved,” remained empty.\n\nIn one of my early conversations with Hunter, he told me about his sadness at having missed his father’s event. “Beau and I have been there since we were carried in baskets during his first campaign,” he said. “We went everywhere with him. At every single major event and every small event that had to do with his political career, I was there. I’ve never missed a rally for my dad. The notion that I’m not standing next to him in Philadelphia, next to the Rocky statue, it’s heartbreaking for me. It’s killing me and it’s killing him. Dad says, ‘Be here.’ Mom says, ‘Be here.’ But at what cost?”\n\nHunter speaks in the warm, circuitous style of his father. Through weeks of conversations, he became increasingly open about his setbacks, aware that many of the stories that he told me would otherwise emerge, likely in a distorted form, in Breitbart or on “Hannity.” He wanted to protect his father from a trickle of disclosures, and to share a personal narrative that he sees no reason to hide. “Look, everybody faces pain,” he said. “Everybody has trauma. There’s addiction in every family. I was in that darkness. I was in that tunnel—it’s a never-ending tunnel. You don’t get rid of it. You figure out how to deal with it.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter Biden was born in 1970, a year and a day after Beau and a year and nine months before their sister, Naomi. His father was twenty-seven, and won his first election, to the New Castle County Council, in November of that year. Two years later, in an immense leap of ambition, he decided to run for the U.S. Senate.\n\nBiden pledged that, in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest, he would never own a stock or a bond. Whatever money he had, he spent on property. His father, Joseph Biden, Sr., managed a Chevrolet dealership in Wilmington, and Joe grew up in a house with his parents, his three siblings, his aunt Gertie, and two uncles. He tried to re-create this arrangement for his own family. He liked historic houses, and bought a center-hall Colonial, built in 1723, on a four-acre lot in the village of North Star, about thirty minutes west of Wilmington. “The large houses were a way for all of us, including aunts and uncles, to have something special,” Hunter said.\n\nJoe Biden depended on his family to help staff his campaigns. His sister, Valerie, who taught at the Quaker day school Wilmington Friends, served as his campaign manager. His brother Jimmy oversaw fund-raising; Frankie, the youngest, helped organize volunteers. When the children were babies, Biden’s wife, Neilia, carried them to community meetings. In November, 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate.\n\nThat December, while Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office, Neilia took the children to Wilmington, to go Christmas-tree shopping. At an intersection, the family car collided with a truck. Neilia and Naomi were killed almost instantly. Beau sustained numerous broken bones, and Hunter suffered a severe head injury. Hunter has frequently said that his first memory is of waking up in a hospital bed next to Beau, who turned to him and said, “I love you, I love you, I love you.” On January 5, 1973, Biden was sworn in as a senator in his sons’ hospital room.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a0a795e00084262e1]||||||\n+++\n\nValerie and Jimmy devoted themselves to the boys’ recovery while Biden took up his role in the Senate. In 1975, he sold the North Star property, and the family moved into a house in Wilmington that had once been owned by members of the du Pont family. Biden, on returning from Washington, often put on a hazmat suit and went into the basement to scrape asbestos off the pipes. He, Hunter, and Beau planted trees and painted the house. Hunter told me that his father would dangle him upside down from the third-floor windows so that he could reach the eaves with a brush. So many people came and went that Tommy Lewis, an old friend of Biden’s who became one of his Senate aides, nicknamed the house the Station. Hunter recalled, “No door was ever locked. The pool was everyone’s pool.” He and Beau were “communal property,” he said. “Everyone had a hand in raising us.” In 1977, Joe Biden married Jill Jacobs, a high-school teacher. (Hunter calls Jill “Mom” and refers to Neilia as “Mommy.”)\n\nBiden frequently took the boys to Washington with him when Congress was in session. Roger Harrison, who worked in Biden’s office for seven years, recalled that one of them often sat on Biden’s lap during staff meetings. If he was busy on the Senate floor, another senator would take Hunter and Beau to his office to hang out. Sometimes, to entertain themselves, the boys would wander over to the Senate gym and sit in a corner of the steam room, eavesdropping on lawmakers.\n\nBeau and Hunter were fiercely close. They attended Archmere Academy, the Catholic high school that was their father’s alma mater. Friends called Beau, a stickler for rules, the Sheriff. Hunter told me, “If we wanted to jump off a cliff into a watering hole, I would say, ‘I’m ready, let’s go,’ and Beau would say, ‘Wait, wait, wait, before we do it, make sure there aren’t any rocks down there.’ ” Brian McGlinchey, a friend of Hunter’s who attended Archmere with the brothers, said, “Beau tended to lead with his head. Hunter often led with his heart.” At Archmere, Beau, with the help of Hunter, who distributed flyers, was elected student-body president. It was clear to family and friends that Beau would follow his father into politics. “Dad knew that is what Beau wanted,” Hunter said.\n\nBiden sold off some of the land at the Station to help pay for Beau to go to the University of Pennsylvania, in 1987\\. That year, Hunter and Beau encouraged their father to run for President, and they were crushed when he withdrew from the race over allegations of plagiarism. (He was accused of copying large portions of a law-review article as a student, and of mimicking a speech given by the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.) Soon afterward, when Biden took his sons to a football game at the University of Pennsylvania, a group of hecklers started a chant about the plagiarism scandal. Hunter jumped to his feet, throwing punches, and his father and Beau had to pull him back.\n\nHunter enrolled at Georgetown University in 1988\\. He and Beau took out student loans to cover their university costs. Hunter worked odd jobs—parking cars at events and unloading sixty-pound boxes of frozen beef—to help pay for his room and board. Ted Dziak, a chaplain-in-residence in Hunter’s freshman dorm, told me, “Hunter was always out there, doing something to gain a little bit of money.”\n\nIn July, 1992, after graduating with a B.A. in history, Hunter began a year as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon. During that time, he met Kathleen Buhle, the daughter of a Chicago schoolteacher and a ticket salesman for the White Sox. Three months after they started dating, Kathleen got pregnant, and the two were married in July, 1993.\n\nBeau attended Syracuse Law School, and began thinking about government service. Hunter imagined a more artistic career for himself. He admired Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff; his favorite novel at the time was Charles Bukowski’s début, “Post Office.” On a whim, he applied to, and was accepted into, the creative-writing program at Syracuse University, where Carver and Wolff had taught. He considered getting a joint M.F.A.-law degree at Syracuse, but, with a baby on the way, he decided to go straight to law school. He was rejected from Yale, his first choice, and enrolled at Georgetown Law. In December, 1993, his daughter Naomi was born.\n\nAfter a year at Georgetown, Hunter transferred to Yale Law, where he completed his degree, in 1996\\. Then he returned to Wilmington with Kathleen and Naomi. Joe Biden was running for reëlection in the Senate, and he appointed Hunter as his deputy campaign manager. Hunter rented an apartment close to his father’s campaign headquarters, and also got a job as a lawyer with MBNA America, a banking holding company based in Delaware, which was one of the largest donors to his father’s campaigns. At the age of twenty-six, Hunter, who was earning more than a hundred thousand dollars and had received a signing bonus, was making nearly as much money as his father. In January, 1998, the conservative reporter and columnist Byron York wrote, in _The American Spectator_, “Certainly lots of children of influential parents end up in very good jobs. But the Biden case is troubling. After all, this is a senator who for years has sermonized against what he says is the corrupting influence of money in politics.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter shared his father’s love of old houses. In 1997, he bought a dilapidated estate in Wilmington, the original structure of which dated to before the Revolutionary War. The previous owner, Anna Sasso, recalled, “They seemed like the perfect family. They were teen-agers, practically. They were so enthusiastic.” That year, Beau started working as a federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s office in Philadelphia, and moved in with his brother’s family, taking over the third floor. Hunter was responsible for the mortgage and most of the expenses. In September, 1998, Hunter and Kathleen had their second daughter, Finnegan. On weekends, the house was a gathering place for friends, including a local woman named Hallie Olivere, whose parents owned a dry-cleaning business. Beau and Hallie married in 2002.\n\nHunter, by then an executive vice-president at MBNA, found the corporate culture stifling. “If you forgot to wear your MBNA lapel pin, someone would stop you in the halls,” he recalled. In 1998, he contacted William Oldaker, a Washington lawyer who had worked on his father’s Presidential campaign in 1987, for advice about how to get a job in the Clinton Administration. Oldaker called William Daley, the Commerce Secretary, who had also worked on Biden’s campaign. Daley, the son of the five-term mayor of Chicago, told me that, because of their shared experience growing up in political families, he empathized with Hunter, and asked his staff to evaluate him for a position as a policy director specializing in the burgeoning Internet economy. Hunter got the job, then sold the Delaware house for roughly twice what he’d paid for it and moved his family to a rental home in the Tenleytown neighborhood of Washington. Hunter and Kathleen sent Naomi and Finnegan—and later Maisy, who was born in 2000—to Sidwell Friends, one of Washington’s most exclusive and expensive schools. Hunter’s salary barely covered the rent, the school fees, and his family’s living expenses. “I’ve pretty much always lived paycheck to paycheck,” Hunter told me. “I never considered it struggling, but it has always been a high-wire act.”\n\nIn late 2000, near the end of President Clinton’s second term, Hunter again consulted Oldaker, who was starting a lobbying business, the National Group. Oldaker asked the co-founder of the firm, Vincent Versage, to teach Hunter the basics of earmarking—the practice of persuading lawmakers to insert language into legislation which directs taxpayer funds to projects that benefit the lobbyist’s clients. In 2001, Robert Skomorucha, an old Biden family friend who worked in the government-and-community-relations department at St. Joseph’s University, proposed that Hunter solicit earmarks for one of the university’s student-volunteer programs, at an underprivileged high school in Philadelphia. Timothy Lannon, the university’s president, who offered Hunter the contract, described Hunter to me as “like his dad: great personally, very engaging, very curious about things and hardworking,” adding that he had “a very strong last name that really paid off in terms of our lobbying efforts.”\n\nVersage told me that the National Group had a strict rule: “Hunter didn’t do anything that involved his dad, didn’t do anything that involved any help from his dad.” Oldaker advised Hunter to restrict his clients to mostly Jesuit universities. “He wasn’t doing McDonnell Douglas or something,” Oldaker told me. Still, Hunter’s name appeared regularly in newspaper stories decrying the cozy relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. An informal arrangement was established: Biden wouldn’t ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn’t tell his father about them. “It wasn’t like we all sat down and agreed on it,” Hunter told me. “It came naturally.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOldaker’s office was across the street from the Bombay Club, an Indian restaurant that was popular with policymakers, lobbyists, diplomats, and journalists. The lounge there became an after-hours gathering place for Hunter, Versage, and a dozen of their colleagues. Irfan Ozarslan, the former general manager, said that he greeted Hunter at the door “at least three or four times a week.” The bartender at the time, Norman, told me that he would have a cigarette waiting for Hunter at his seat.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d4]||||||\n+++\n\nJoe Biden grew up around relatives with alcohol problems, and at a young age he decided to abstain. Hunter—who spoke frankly to me about his struggles with addiction—started drinking socially as a teen-ager. When he was a student at Georgetown, in the early nineties, he took up smoking Marlboro Red cigarettes, and occasionally used cocaine. Once, hoping to buy cocaine, he was sold a piece of crack, but he wasn’t sure how to take the drug. “I didn’t have a stem,” Hunter said. “I didn’t have a pipe.” Improvising, he stuffed the crack into a cigarette and smoked it. “It didn’t have much of an effect,” he said.\n\nIn 2001, Hunter, Kathleen, and their children moved back to Wilmington to be closer to the rest of the Biden family, and Hunter commuted to Washington on Amtrak, as his father did. Sometimes he missed the last train and stayed in a rental room at the Army and Navy Club. “When I found myself making the decision to have another drink or get on a train, I knew I had a problem,” he said. In 2003, Kathleen and the girls returned to Washington. Hunter recalled that Kathleen told him to get sober, starting by not drinking for thirty days. “And I wouldn’t drink for thirty days, but, on day thirty-one, I’d be right back to it,” he said. That September, on a business trip, he looked up rehabilitation centers, and soon admitted himself to Crossroads Centre Antigua for a month. The day after his return, Beau accompanied him to his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, in Dupont Circle.\n\nBy the mid-two-thousands, a growing number of lawmakers were criticizing earmarking as a waste of taxpayer money and a boon to special interests. Hunter was concerned about his future as a lobbyist, and his financial worries increased in 2006, when he bought a $1.6-million house in an affluent neighborhood. Without the savings for a down payment, he took out a mortgage for a hundred and ten per cent of the purchase price.\n\nIn 2006, Hunter and his uncle Jimmy Biden, along with another partner, entered into a twenty-one-million-dollar deal to buy Paradigm, a hedge-fund group that claimed to manage $1.5 billion in assets. Hunter said that the deal sounded “super attractive,” but that it fell apart after he and Jimmy learned that the company was worth less than they thought, and that the lawyer they were working with was a convicted felon awaiting sentencing. Hunter and Jimmy, who together went on to buy a stake in the company, estimated that they lost at least $1.3 million on the initial venture, which Hunter described as “a tragicomedy.” To help repay a law firm that had put up the money to initiate the transaction, Hunter obtained a million-dollar note against his house from Washington First Bank, which was co-founded by Oldaker. On January 5, 2007, two days before Biden announced his decision to run for President, Hunter and Jimmy were sued by their former partner in New York. The suit was settled but resulted in a flurry of headlines.\n\nIn the lead-up to the January, 2008, Iowa Democratic Presidential caucuses, Hunter drove from Washington to Des Moines to campaign with his father. “I’m like his security blanket,” Hunter said. “I don’t tell the staff what to do. I’m not there giving directions or orders. I shake everybody’s hands. And then I tell him to close his eyes on the bus. I can say things to him that nobody else can.” Biden did poorly in Iowa, and soon dropped out of the race. On August 23, 2008, Obama, the Democratic nominee, publicly introduced Biden as his running mate. He praised Beau, who had recently become Delaware’s attorney general and was getting ready to deploy to Iraq with his National Guard unit.\n\nHunter had heard that, during the primaries, some of Obama’s advisers had criticized him to reporters for his earmarking work. Hunter said that he wasn’t told by members of the Obama campaign to end his lobbying activities, but that he knew “the writing was on the wall.” Hunter told his lobbying clients that he would no longer represent them, and resigned from an unpaid seat on the board of Amtrak, a role for which, Hunter said, the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid had tapped him. “I wanted my father to have a clean slate,” Hunter told me. “I didn’t want to limit him in any way.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn September, 2008, Hunter launched a boutique consulting firm, Seneca Global Advisors, named for the largest of the Finger Lakes, in New York State, where his mother had grown up. In pitch meetings with prospective clients, Hunter said that he could help small and mid-sized companies expand into markets in the U.S. and other countries. In June, 2009, five months after Joe Biden became Vice-President, Hunter co-founded a second company, Rosemont Seneca Partners, with Christopher Heinz, Senator [John Kerry](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/john-kerry)’s stepson and an heir to the food-company fortune, and Devon Archer, a former Abercrombie & Fitch model who started his finance career at Citibank in Asia and who had been friends with Heinz at Yale. (Heinz and Archer already had a private-equity fund called Rosemont Capital.) Heinz believed that Hunter would share his aversion to entering into business deals that could attract public scrutiny, but over time Hunter and Archer seized opportunities that did not include Heinz, who was less inclined to take risks.\n\nIn 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital—and, potentially, capital from other countries—in companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners, and, in November, they signed contracts related to the deal. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House.\n\nIn December, 2013, Vice-President Biden flew to Beijing to meet with President [Xi Jinping](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/xi-jinping). Biden often asked one of his grandchildren to accompany him on his international trips, and he invited Finnegan to come on this one. Hunter told his father that he wanted to join them. According to a Beijing-based BHR representative, Hunter, shortly after arriving in Beijing, on December 4th, helped arrange for Li to shake hands with his father in the lobby of the American delegation’s hotel. Afterward, Hunter and Li had what both parties described as a social meeting. Hunter told me that he didn’t understand why anyone would have been concerned about this. “How do I go to Beijing, halfway around the world, and not see them for a cup of coffee?” he said.\n\nHunter’s meeting with Li and his relationship with BHR attracted little attention at the time, but some of Biden’s advisers were worried that Hunter, by meeting with a business associate during his father’s visit, would expose the Vice-President to criticism. The former senior White House aide told me that Hunter’s behavior invited questions about whether he “was leveraging access for his benefit, which just wasn’t done in that White House. Optics really mattered, and that seemed to be cutting it pretty close, even if nothing nefarious was going on.” When I asked members of Biden’s staff whether they discussed their concerns with the Vice-President, several of them said that they had been too intimidated to do so. “Everyone who works for him has been screamed at,” a former adviser told me. Others said that they were wary of hurting his feelings. One business associate told me that Biden, during difficult conversations about his family, “got deeply melancholy, which, to me, is more painful than if someone yelled and screamed at me. It’s like you’ve hurt him terribly. That was always my fear, that I would be really touching a very fragile part of him.”\n\nFor another venture, Archer travelled to Kiev to pitch investors on a real-estate fund he managed, Rosemont Realty. There, he met Mykola Zlochevsky, the co-founder of Burisma, one of Ukraine’s largest natural-gas producers. Zlochevsky had served as ecology minister under the pro-Russian government of [Viktor Yanukovych](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-trump-russia-investigation-and-the-mafia-state). After public protests in 2013 and early 2014, the Ukrainian parliament had voted to remove Yanukovych and called for his arrest. Under the new Ukrainian government, authorities in Kiev, with the encouragement of the Obama Administration, launched an investigation into whether Zlochevsky had used his cabinet position to grant exploration licenses that benefitted Burisma. (The status of the inquiry is unclear, but no proof of criminal activity has been publicly disclosed. Zlochevsky could not be reached for comment, and Burisma did not respond to queries.) In a related investigation, which was ultimately closed owing to a lack of evidence, British authorities temporarily froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky.\n\nIn early 2014, Zlochevsky sought to assemble a high-profile international board to oversee Burisma, telling prospective members that he wanted the company to adopt Western standards of transparency. Among the board members he recruited was a former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who had a reputation as a dedicated reformer. In early 2014, at Zlochevsky’s suggestion, Kwaśniewski met with Archer in Warsaw and encouraged him to join Burisma’s board, arguing that the company was critical to Ukraine’s independence from Russia. Archer agreed.\n\nWhen Archer told Hunter that the board needed advice on how to improve the company’s corporate governance, Hunter recommended the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was “of counsel.” The firm brought in the investigative agency Nardello & Co. to assess Burisma’s history of corruption. Hunter joined Archer on the Burisma board in April, 2014\\. Three months later, in a draft report to Boies Schiller, Nardello said that it was “unable to identify any information to date regarding any current government investigation into Zlochevsky or Burisma,” but cited unnamed sources saying that Zlochevsky could be “vulnerable to investigation for financial crimes” and for “perceived abuse of power.”\n\nVice-President Biden was playing a central role in overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine, and took the lead in calling on Kiev to fight rampant corruption. On May 13, 2014, after Hunter’s role on the Burisma board was reported in the news, Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson, said that the State Department was not concerned about perceived conflicts of interest, because Hunter was a “private citizen.” Hunter told Burisma’s management and other board members that he would not be involved in any matters that were connected to the U.S. government or to his father. Kwaśniewski told me, “We never discussed how the Vice-President can help us. Frankly speaking, we didn’t need such help.”\n\nSeveral former officials in the Obama Administration and at the State Department insisted that Hunter’s role at Burisma had no effect on his father’s policies in Ukraine, but said that, nevertheless, Hunter should not have taken the board seat. As the former senior White House aide put it, there was a perception that “Hunter was on the loose, potentially undermining his father’s message.” The same aide said that Hunter should have recognized that at least some of his foreign business partners were motivated to work with him because they wanted “to be able to say that they are affiliated with Biden.” A former business associate said, “The _appearance_ of a conflict of interest is good enough, at this level of politics, to keep you from doing things like that.”\n\nIn December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: “Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’ ”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nHunter was not always at ease as the son of the Vice-President. He asked that the Secret Service stop deploying agents to accompany him, a request that was eventually granted. He also became offended when he felt that his father wasn’t treated respectfully enough by Obama and his advisers. In 2012, Biden, responding to a question about same-sex marriage on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” said that he was “absolutely comfortable” with all couples having the “exact same rights.” Obama had yet to publicly take a similar stance, and Biden’s statement upset some White House officials. Hunter thought that Obama and his advisers should have acknowledged his father’s good political instincts.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a4a87a600089f0d46]||||||\n+++\n\nHunter said that he limited his social interactions with Biden’s White House colleagues, because he didn’t want to be in a situation “where I’m playing golf with the President or one of his aides and look at my phone and see another headline that reads ‘*President Makes Joke About Biden*{: .small}.’ ” Kathleen felt differently about the White House. Their daughter Maisy was in the same class at Sidwell Friends as Sasha, the Obamas’ younger daughter. The two girls became close, and Kathleen and Michelle Obama became friends, attending SoulCycle and Solidcore exercise classes together almost every day. Some evenings, they went out to dinner or had drinks at the White House. Kathleen went on vacations with Michelle, mutual friends, and their daughters.\n\nHunter saw himself as a provider for the Biden family; he even helped to pay off Beau’s law-school debts. But he often wished that, like his father and his brother, he could contribute more to society. Through his business, he got to know an Australian-American former military-intelligence officer named Greg Keeley, who regaled him with stories about his career in the Royal Australian Navy. After moving to the United States, at forty, Keeley had obtained an age waiver to join the U.S. Navy as a reservist. While on reserve duty at a U.S. military base in southern Afghanistan on September 11, 2011, he and members of his unit watched Vice-President Biden deliver a speech at the Pentagon about the attacks of 9/11\\. After the speech, Keeley sent an e-mail to Hunter to tell him that members of his unit thought the Vice-President’s message was “spot on.” Hunter passed the note on to his father, who wrote Keeley an e-mail. “Keep your heads down,” it said. “You are the finest group of warriors in all of history.”\n\nKeeley helped convince Hunter that it wasn’t too late for him to join the Navy Reserves. He told me, “My message to him was: If you feel the call to serve, which I encouraged, it doesn’t really matter what your rank is and what’s on your shoulder board—it is that you’re serving your country. Hunter took that message to heart and acted upon it.” With a letter of recommendation from Keeley, Hunter applied for an age waiver, which the Navy granted. The service has a zero-tolerance drug-and-alcohol-abuse policy, and states that all recruits will be asked “questions about prior drug and alcohol use.” Hunter disclosed that he had “used drugs in the past,” but said that he was now sober, and the Navy granted him a second waiver.\n\nHunter had suffered his first relapse, after seven years of sobriety, in November, 2010, when he drank three Bloody Marys on a flight home from a business trip to Madrid. He continued to drink in secret for several months, then confided in Beau and returned to Crossroads Centre. He had another relapse in early 2013, after he suffered from a bout of shingles, for which he was prescribed painkillers. When the prescription ran out, he resumed drinking.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, he was assigned to a Reserve unit at Naval Station Norfolk. He had hoped to work in naval intelligence, but was given a job in a public-affairs unit. In a small, private ceremony at the White House, Hunter was sworn in by his father. Later that month, the night before Hunter’s first weekend of Reserve duty, he stopped at a bar a few blocks from the White House. Outside, Hunter said, he bummed a cigarette from two men who told him that they were from South Africa. He felt “amped up” as he was driving down to Norfolk, and then “incredibly exhausted.” He told me that he called Beau and said, “I don’t know what’s going on.” Beau drove from Delaware to meet Hunter at a hotel near the naval station. “He got me shipshape and drove me into the base,” he said. On his first day, Hunter had a urine sample taken for testing.\n\nA few months later, Hunter received a letter saying that his urinalysis had detected cocaine in his system. Under Navy rules, a positive drug test typically triggers a discharge. Hunter wrote a letter to the Navy Reserve, saying that he didn’t know how the drug had got into his system and suggesting that the cigarettes he’d smoked outside the bar might have been laced with cocaine. Hunter called Beau, who contacted Tom Gallagher, a former Navy lawyer who had worked with Beau at the U.S. Attorney’s office in Philadelphia. Gallagher agreed to represent Hunter pro bono, but it became clear that, given Hunter’s history with drugs, an appeals panel was unlikely to believe the story that he had ingested cocaine involuntarily, and that appealing the decision would require closed-door hearings and the testimony of witnesses, increasing the likelihood of leaks to the press. Hunter decided not to appeal. Navy records show that Hunter’s discharge took effect on February 18, 2014.\n\nHunter did not tell anyone except his father and his brother about the reason for his discharge, and he tried to get his drinking under control. In July, 2014, he went to a clinic in Tijuana that provided a treatment using ibogaine, a psychoactive alkaloid derived from the roots of a West African shrub, which is illegal in America. Hunter then drove to Flagstaff, Arizona, where he met with Thom Knoles, a practitioner of Vedic meditation, who said that he advised Hunter to meditate twice a day, to help keep “his cravings for alcohol at bay.” Knoles said that Hunter struck him as “just a good man.” He was “nearly clean,” Knoles said. “But, to be honest, there is such a thing as a dry drunk. I could see that he was in a very delicate position.” Knoles said that Hunter told him about how much he relied on Beau for support and confessed that “his relationship with his other great, deep partner in life, his wife, had been brutalized by him through his loss of control.”\n\nThat fall, Hunter went to Big Sur, California, to attend a twelve-step yoga retreat at the Esalen Institute. Toward the end of his week there, a reporter from the _Wall Street Journal_ contacted the Vice-President’s office, seeking comment on Hunter’s discharge from the Navy. At San Francisco International Airport, Hunter was waiting for his flight home when he saw the story on the front page of the _Journal_. “I was heartbroken,” he said.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Hunter, Beau, and their families took a vacation together on Lake Michigan. During the trip, Beau became disoriented and was rushed to the hospital. He’d had a health scare in May, 2010, when—six months after he returned from Iraq—he suffered a stroke. He had appeared to recover quickly, and continued to work as Delaware’s attorney general, but he struggled to remember certain words, and sometimes talked about hearing music playing when there was none.\n\nSoon after Beau’s admittance to the hospital, doctors identified a mass in his brain. It was glioblastoma multiforme, a type of brain tumor. Patients who receive similar diagnoses tend to live no longer than two years. As Beau received radiation treatment, his motor and speech skills started to decline. In the spring of 2015, he underwent an experimental procedure in which an engineered virus was injected directly into the tumor, but it was unsuccessful. In late May, doctors removed Beau’s tracheostomy tube, telling the family that he would likely die within a few hours. Beau kept breathing on his own for almost a day and a half before he died, surrounded by his family.\n\nOn June 6, 2015, thousands of people paid their respects at a service at St. Anthony of Padua Church, in Wilmington. The next day, President Obama, Ashley Biden, and Hunter, who was fearful of public speaking, delivered eulogies. On the drive back to Washington, Hunter—moved by the outpouring of support for him and his family at the funeral—told Kathleen that he was thinking about running for public office. She pointed out that he had only recently been discharged from the Navy after testing positive for cocaine. They rode the rest of the way home in silence. (Kathleen declined to comment for this article.)\n\nIn couples therapy, Hunter and Kathleen had reached an agreement: if Hunter started drinking again, he would have to move out of the house. A day after their twenty-second anniversary, Hunter left a therapy session, drank a bottle of vodka, and moved out. Later that month, Zlochevsky, the Burisma co-founder, invited him to Norway on a fishing trip. Hunter brought along Maisy and Beau’s nine-year-old son, Robert. Hunter said that, every night, he and his colleagues on the trip drank a single shot of liquor before going to bed. Kathleen found out and was angry. Hunter began to confide in Hallie, whom he was growing closer to.\n\nHunter said that, in July, 2015, “I tried to show Kathleen: I want back in.” He enrolled as an outpatient in the Charles O’Brien Center for Addiction Treatment, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was prescribed two drugs, one to lessen his cravings and another to make him feel nauseated if he drank. He then enrolled in an inpatient program for executives at Caron Treatment Centers, where he used the pseudonym Hunter Smith. On returning to Washington, he began a program that required him to carry a Breathalyzer with a built-in camera.\n\nThat summer, Ashley Madison, a dating service for married people—which used the slogan “Life is short. Have an affair”—disclosed that hackers had breached its user data. In late August, Breitbart reported that it had found a “Robert Biden” profile among the leaked files. Hunter denied that the account belonged to him, but Kathleen was deeply embarrassed by the story. Two months later, Hunter and Kathleen agreed to formally separate. On October 21, 2015, Joe Biden appeared in the White House Rose Garden, flanked by Jill and Obama, and announced that he would not run for President in 2016, talking about the time that it had taken the family to recover from Beau’s death.\n\nUntil mid-December, Hunter practiced yoga daily. A teacher from his yoga studio told me, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a person try as hard to heal as he did.” When Hunter stopped coming to class, the teacher went to his apartment, near Logan Circle, and knocked on the door. Hunter told me that he pretended not to be at home. For weeks, he said, he left the apartment only to buy bottles of Smirnoff vodka at Logan Circle Liquor. Several times a day, his father called him, and Hunter assured him that he was O.K. Eventually, Biden showed up unannounced at the apartment. Hunter said that his father told him, “I need you. What do we have to do?”\n\nIn February, 2016, Hunter went back to the Esalen Institute, and then spent a week skiing by himself at Lake Tahoe. When he returned to Washington, he enrolled in yet another addiction-treatment program, run by the Kolmac Outpatient Recovery Center. On his way to Kolmac, he passed several homeless people, including a middle-aged woman who went by the name Bicycles, because of the bike she took with her everywhere. Later, whenever Hunter saw Bicycles near his apartment, he would give her a twenty-dollar bill to buy him a pack of Marlboro Reds and tell her to keep the change. One rainy night, Hunter said, he offered Bicycles his spare bedroom, and she stayed for several months.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 2016, Hunter was consulting for five or six major clients. Once or twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that took place in Europe. He said that, in June, 2016, while in Monte Carlo for a meeting, he went to a hotel night club and used cocaine that a stranger offered him in the bathroom. He told his counsellors at Kolmac about his relapse but refused to take a drug test, out of concern that the results could be used against him and published in the press. When Kolmac’s staff insisted that he take the test, he decided to leave the program.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/5d16889a372ce200087ed4d2]||||||\n+++\n\nIn August, Hunter and Hallie went to the Hamptons with Hallie’s children. They texted constantly after getting back, and Hunter started to spend most nights in Delaware, at Hallie’s house, watching television until very late. “We were sharing a very specific grief,” Hunter recalled. “I started to think of Hallie as the only person in my life who understood my loss.”\n\nThat fall, Hunter made plans to go to the Grace Grove Lifestyle Center, in Sedona, Arizona. During a layover at Los Angeles International Airport, before his connecting flight to Phoenix, he went to a nearby hotel bar and realized that he had left his wallet on the plane. It had belonged to Beau and still contained his attorney-general identification badge, and also Hunter’s driver’s license, without which he couldn’t board his flight. Using a credit card he had in his pocket, Hunter checked into a hotel in Marina del Rey, where he waited for the airline to return the wallet.\n\nInstead of going to Grace Grove, Hunter stayed in Los Angeles for about a week. He said that he “needed a way to forget,” and that, soon after his arrival in L.A., he asked a homeless man in Pershing Square where he could buy crack. Hunter said that the man took him to a nearby homeless encampment, where, in a narrow passageway between tents, someone put a gun to his head before realizing that he was a buyer. He returned to buy more crack a few times that week.\n\nOne night, outside a club on Hollywood Boulevard, Hunter and another man got into an argument, and a group of bouncers intervened. A friend of one of the bouncers, a Samoan man who went by the nickname Baby Down, felt sorry for Hunter and took him to Mel’s Drive-In to get some food, and to his hotel to pick up his belongings. Early on the morning of October 26th, Baby Down dropped Hunter off at the Hertz rental office at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nHunter said that, at that point, he had not slept for several days. Driving east on Interstate 10, just beyond Palm Springs, he lost control of his car, which jumped the median and skidded to a stop on the shoulder of the westbound side. He called Hertz, which came to collect the damaged car and gave him a second rental. Later, on a sharp bend on a mountainous road, Hunter recalled, a large barn owl flew over the hood of the car and then seemed to follow him, dropping in front of the headlights. He said that he has no idea whether the owl was real or a hallucination. On the night of October 28th, Hunter dropped the car off at a Hertz office in Prescott, Arizona, and Grace Grove sent a van to pick him up.\n\nZachary Romfo, who worked at the Hertz office in Prescott, told me that he found a crack pipe in the car and, on one of the consoles, a line of white-powder residue. Beau Biden’s attorney-general badge was on the dashboard. Hertz called the Prescott police department, and officers there filed a “narcotics offense” report, listing the items seized from the car, including a plastic baggie containing a “white powdery substance,” a Secret Service business card, credit cards, and Hunter’s driver’s license. Later, according to a police report, Secret Service agents informed Prescott police that Hunter was “secure/well.” Subsequent test results indicated that the glass pipe contained cocaine residue, but investigators didn’t find any fingerprints on it. Public prosecutors in the county and the city declined to bring a case against Hunter, citing a lack of evidence that the pipe had been used by him. Jon Paladini, Prescott’s city attorney, told me that he was not aware of any requests by officials in Washington to drop the investigation into Hunter. “It’s a very Republican area,” he said. “I don’t think political favors, necessarily, would even work, had they been requested.”\n\nAfter a week at Grace Grove, Hunter checked into a resort spa called Mii Amo, and called Hallie, who flew to meet him. During her stay, Hunter said, they decided to become a couple. When they returned to Delaware, they tried, unsuccessfully, to keep their relationship secret.\n\nOn December 9, 2016, Kathleen filed for divorce, and on February 23, 2017, she filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court seeking to freeze Hunter’s assets, alleging that he “created financial concerns for the family by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs, and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills.” The motion was leaked to the New York _Post_, along with the revelation that Hunter and Hallie were dating.\n\nKathleen told friends that she felt ostracized by the Biden family. Hunter denied hiring prostitutes, and said that he hadn’t been to a strip club in years. But, he said, the evening the story was published, “I went directly to a strip club. I said, ‘Fuck them.’ ”\n\nThe first that Biden heard of the relationship was when the _Post_ asked his office for comment. Hunter issued a statement saying that he and Hallie were “incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time.” Hunter told me he appealed to his father to make a statement, too: “I said, ‘Dad, Dad, you have to.’ He said, ‘Hunter, I don’t know if I should. But I’ll do whatever you want me to do.’ I said, ‘Dad, if people find out, but they think you’re not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong. The kids have to know, Dad, that there’s nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you.’ ” A former Biden aide confirmed that Biden agreed to issue a statement because of concerns about Hunter’s well-being. Biden told the _Post_, “We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. . . . They have mine and Jill’s full and complete support and we are happy for them.” The _Post_ ran the statement under the headline *“Beau Biden’s Widow Having Affair with His Married Brother.”*{: .small}\n\nIn August, Hunter rented a house in Annapolis, Maryland, where he, Hallie, and her two children hoped to have some privacy, but, several months later, they split up. “All we got was shit from everybody, all the time,” Hunter said. “It was really hard. And I realized that I’m not helping anybody by sticking around.” (Hallie declined to comment.) In early 2018, he moved to Los Angeles. The idea, he said, was to “completely disappear.”\n\nHunter said that, in divorce proceedings, he offered to give Kathleen “everything,” including a monthly payment of thirty-seven thousand dollars for alimony, tuition, and child-care costs for a decade. Hunter told me that he was living on approximately four thousand dollars a month; he was hardly poor, but it was an adjustment. On occasion, transactions on his credit cards were declined.\n\nOne of Kathleen’s motions contains a reference to “a large diamond” that had come into Hunter’s possession. The motion seems to imply that it was one of Hunter’s “personal indulgences.” When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been given the diamond by the Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming, who was trying to make connections in Washington among prominent Democrats and Republicans, and whom he had met in the middle of the divorce. Hunter told me that two associates accompanied him to his first meeting with Ye, in Miami, and that they surprised him by giving Ye a magnum of rare vintage Scotch worth thousands of dollars.\n\nHunter was on the board of the World Food Program USA, a nonprofit that generates support for the U.N. World Food Programme, and he had hoped that Ye would make a large aid donation. At dinner that night, they discussed the donation, and then the conversation turned to business opportunities. Hunter offered to use his contacts to help identify investment opportunities for Ye’s company, CEFC China Energy, in liquefied-natural-gas projects in the United States. After the dinner, Ye sent a 2.8-carat diamond to Hunter’s hotel room with a card thanking him for their meeting. “I was, like, Oh, my God,” Hunter said. (In Kathleen’s court motion, the diamond is estimated to be worth eighty thousand dollars. Hunter said he believes the value is closer to ten thousand.) When I asked him if he thought the diamond was intended as a bribe, he said no: “What would they be bribing me for? My dad wasn’t in office.” Hunter said that he gave the diamond to his associates, and doesn’t know what they did with it. “I knew it wasn’t a good idea to take it. I just felt like it was weird,” he said.\n\nHunter began negotiating a deal for CEFC to invest forty million dollars in a liquefied-natural-gas project on Monkey Island, in Louisiana, which, he said, was projected to create thousands of jobs. “I was more proud of it than you can imagine,” he told me. In the summer of 2017, Ye talked with Hunter about his concern that U.S. law-enforcement agencies were investigating one of his associates, Patrick Ho. Hunter, who sometimes works as a private lawyer, agreed to represent Ho, and tried to figure out whether Ho was in legal jeopardy in the U.S. That November, just after Ye and Hunter agreed on the Monkey Island deal, U.S. authorities detained Ho at the airport. He was later sentenced to three years in prison for his role in a multiyear, multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top government officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC. In February, 2018, Ye was detained by Chinese authorities, reportedly as part of an anti-corruption investigation, and the deal with Hunter fell through. Hunter said that he did not consider Ye to be a “shady character at all,” and characterized the outcome as “bad luck.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nJoe Biden is hardly the first politician to have faced scrutiny for the business dealings of a family member. In 1973, during the Watergate investigation, the Washington _Post_ reported that [Richard Nixon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/richard-nixon) had the phone of his brother Donald tapped for at least a year, because he feared that Donald’s “various financial activities might bring embarrassment to the Nixon administration.” In the late seventies, the F.B.I. investigated President [Jimmy Carter](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jimmy-carter)’s younger brother, Billy, after it emerged that he was on the payroll of the Libyan government. In an extensive report on the affair issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Biden was a member, Billy was quoted as saying that “he did not need anyone in Washington telling him how to conduct his private business.” Carter said that he had tried, unsuccessfully, to “discourage Billy from making any other trip to Libya” and “to keep him out of the newspapers for a few weeks.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5d168899f2cdba00092a45b9]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nBiden’s approach was to deal with Hunter’s activities by largely ignoring them. This may have temporarily allowed Biden to truthfully inform reporters that his decisions were not affected by Hunter. But, as Robert Weissman, the president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said, “It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Hunter’s foreign employers and partners were seeking to leverage Hunter’s relationship with Joe, either by seeking improper influence or to project access to him.”\n\nIt is clear that Hunter and Biden’s decades-old decision not to discuss business matters has exposed both father and son to attacks. (Biden declined to comment for this article.) In March of last year, Peter Schweizer, a conservative researcher and a senior editor-at-large at Breitbart, published “Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends.” Schweizer is best known for “Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Clinton Rich,” which was released in May, 2015\\. Research for that book was funded by the Government Accountability Institute, which Schweizer co-founded, in 2012, with Stephen Bannon. Under the law, the G.A.I. is a nonpartisan organization. But, as Joshua Green wrote, in “Devil’s Bargain,” his book about Bannon’s role in Trump’s rise, Bannon saw “Clinton Cash” as “the key to orchestrating Hillary Clinton’s downfall.” It was, Green writes, “the culmination of everything Bannon learned during his time in Goldman Sachs, Internet Gaming Entertainment, Hollywood, and Breitbart News.”\n\nAs Bannon and Schweizer had hoped, investigative journalists from the mainstream press followed up on Schweizer’s many examples of the Clintons’ purported conflicts of interest. In April, 2015, two weeks before Schweizer’s book came out, the _Times_ published a front-page article, by Jo Becker and Mike McIntire, that cited Schweizer’s research alongside Becker’s own reporting from 2008\\. The article singled out a Canadian mining magnate, Frank Giustra, who donated tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. The story suggested that the donations of Giustra and others might have created conflicts of interest, at a time when the Obama Administration was negotiating to allow the Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to gain control of a swath of America’s untapped uranium deposits by purchasing the Canadian company Uranium One. The _Times_ was criticized for building on Schweizer’s work, and, two years later, Eileen Sullivan, in another _Times_ article, wrote, “There has been no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation influenced the Uranium One deal.” Still, “Clinton Cash” did exactly what Bannon hoped it would do, Green writes, “sullying Clinton’s image in a way that she never fully recovered from.”\n\n“Secret Empires,” which details Hunter’s activities in China and Ukraine, focusses on what Schweizer calls “corruption by proxy,” which he defines as a “new corruption” that is “difficult to detect” and that, though often legal, makes “good money for a politician and his family and friends” and leaves “American politicians vulnerable to overseas financial pressure.” Schweizer often relies on innuendo to supplement his reporting. At one point, he describes “one of the few public sightings” of Hunter in Beijing, when Hunter, “dressed in a dark overcoat,” followed Biden into a shop to buy a Magnum ice cream. “Intentionally or not,” Schweizer writes, “Hunter Biden was showing the Chinese that he had _guanxi_”—connections.\n\nSchweizer asserts that “Rosemont Seneca Partners had been negotiating an exclusive deal with Chinese officials, which they signed approximately ten days after Hunter visited China with his father.” In fact, the deal had been signed before the trip—according to the BHR representative, it was a business license that came through shortly afterward—and Hunter was not a signatory. Hunter and Archer said that they never met with any Chinese officials about the fund. And the deal wasn’t with Rosemont Seneca Partners but with a new holding company, established solely by Archer; Christopher Heinz was not part of the BHR transaction. Schweizer also asserts that the Chinese fund was “lucrative” for Hunter, but Hunter and his business partners told me that he has yet to receive a payment from the company.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn October, 2017, the special counsel [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), investigating Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential election, indicted Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, on twelve counts, including committing conspiracy against the United States by failing to register as a foreign agent of Ukraine. (Manafort pleaded guilty to that charge in September, 2018.) Making a case that Hunter had his own Ukrainian scandal, Schweizer implies that Joe Biden had been consulted in advance about Hunter and Archer’s work with Burisma. On April 16, 2014, he notes, shortly before the announcement that Hunter and Archer had taken seats on the company’s board, Archer made a “private visit to the White House for a meeting with Vice-President Biden.” Hunter, Archer, and Archer’s son Lukas, who is now twelve, told me that the visit was arranged by Hunter for Lukas, who was working on a model of the White House for a grade-school assignment. Afterward, Lukas posted a picture on Instagram of himself shaking the Vice-President’s hand. Hunter and Archer said that Burisma was never discussed.\n\nRudolph Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, has also aggressively promoted what he has called the “alleged Ukraine conspiracy” in interviews and on social media. Giuliani told me that, in the fall of 2018, he spoke to Viktor Shokin, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general. Shokin told him that Vice-President Biden had him fired in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma and the company’s payments to Hunter and Archer. Giuliani said that, in January, 2019, he met with Yurii Lutsenko, Ukraine’s current prosecutor general, in New York, and Lutsenko confirmed Shokin’s version of events.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, John Solomon, an opinion contributor to _The Hill,_ wrote about Shokin’s claim that he had been conducting a corruption probe into Burisma and Hunter when he was dismissed. A month later, the _Times_ reported that Hunter “was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.” The story, by Kenneth P. Vogel and Iuliia Mendel, provoked some Democrats to express concern that the _Times_ was again lending credence to allegations made by Schweizer and other Trump allies. Giuliani retweeted the article, and Trump called for the Justice Department to investigate. Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Obama, tweeted, “Zero lessons have been learned from 2016: 1\\. Mainstream outlet credulously accepts Trump conspiracy about opponent 2\\. Trump propaganda machine uses story to spread the conspiracy on social media and through digital ads 3\\. Voters believe it, ignoring subsequent fact checks.”\n\nThere is no credible evidence that Biden sought Shokin’s removal in order to protect Hunter. According to Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, Shokin was removed because of concerns by the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, and the U.S. government that he wasn’t pursuing corruption investigations. Contrary to the assertions that Shokin was fired because he was investigating Burisma and Zlochevsky, Hochstein said, “many of us in the U.S. government believed that Shokin was the one protecting Zlochevsky.” In May, Giuliani scheduled a visit to Ukraine, and told the _Times_ that he would look into Hunter’s involvement with Burisma, “because that information will be very, very helpful to my client,” but then abruptly cancelled the trip, amid reports that Ukraine’s President-elect was unwilling to meet with him. A week later, on May 16th, Lutsenko appeared to shift his position on Burisma, telling Bloomberg News that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son, and that “a company can pay however much it wants to its board.” The reasons for his reversal were unclear, but Daria Kaleniuk, the head of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, in Kiev, speculated that Lutsenko, in talking with Giuliani, had been trying to “pump his political muscle,” a strategy that had proved ineffective in the new political climate.\n\nThat month, Hunter declined Burisma’s offer to serve another term on the board, believing that the controversy had become a distraction. But he said that he was proud of his work there, and that he thought the criticism was misplaced. “I feel the decisions that I made were the right decisions for my family and for me,” he told me. “Was it worth it? Was it worth the pain? No. It certainly wasn’t worth the grief.” He went on, “I would never have been able to predict that Donald Trump would have picked me out as the tip of the spear against the one person they believe can beat them.”\n\nAnd yet, to many voters, the controversy over Hunter’s business dealings will appear to have been avoidable, a product of Biden’s resistance to having difficult conversations, particularly those involving his family. Hunter said that, in his talks with his father, “I’m saying sorry to him, and he says, ‘I’m the one who’s sorry,’ and we have an ongoing debate about who should be more sorry. And we both realize that the only true antidote to any of this is winning. He says, ‘Look, it’s going to go away.’ There is truly a higher purpose here, and this will go away. So can you survive the assault?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn early May, Hunter met a thirty-two-year-old South African woman named Melissa Cohen, a filmmaker who was working on a series of documentaries about indigenous tribes in southern Africa. A few days after their first date, Hunter had the word “shalom” tattooed in Hebrew letters on the inside of his left bicep, to match a tattoo that Cohen has in the same spot. On May 15th, less than a week after they met, he proposed. The next morning, she accepted, and he bought the simplest gold wedding bands he could find, then called a marriage service, which sent over an officiant.\n\nA month later, on the roof deck of Cohen’s apartment, off the Sunset Strip, Cohen sat on a bench next to Hunter, who was wearing jeans and a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan *“BE FUCKING NICE.”*{: .small} Hunter recalled that, after the ceremony, “I called my dad and said that we just got married. He was on speaker, and he said to her, ‘Thank you for giving my son the courage to love again.’ ” Hunter paused, his eyes filling with tears. “And he said to me, ‘Honey, I knew that when you found love again that I’d get you back.’ ” Cohen rubbed his shoulders. He went on, “And my reply was, I said, ‘Dad, I always had love. And the only thing that allowed me to see it was the fact that you never gave up on me, you always believed in me.’ ”\n\nHunter told me that, on a recent evening, he had seen reports on Twitter that Trump was calling for him to be investigated by the Justice Department. Then Hunter noticed a helicopter overhead. “I said, ‘I hope they’re taking pictures of us right now. I hope it’s a live feed to the President so he can see just how much I care about the tweets.’ ” He went on, “I told Melissa, ‘I don’t care. Fuck you, Mr. President. Here I am, living my life.’ ” ♦\n\nA previous version of this article misspelled Brian McGlinchey’s last name and mischaracterized the New York _Times_’ interaction with Peter Schweizer and its reporting on Uranium One.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d8f397f5b30646d0724","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Joe Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"joe-biden"},{"id":"5c2e1cd1ee7fe02cbd1633a7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sons","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sons"},{"id":"5c2e1c7736cecf40192141c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Presidential Candidates","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"presidential-candidates"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1ca722d4972cd5b832c6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drugs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drugs"},{"id":"5d13aed2771fd7000873bdf8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hunter Biden","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hunter-biden"}],"sections":[{"id":"5944867342fa443beba19b29","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5a6100548bcd0613d5da686f","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Adam Entous joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2018, covering intelligence, national security, and foreign affairs.

The more you delve into the story, the more it reads like something Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen cobbled together after a guys’ getaway to Kiev. To make the selection a bit easier, let’s make it a multiple-choice question:\n\n> (a) Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, whom the *Wall Street Journal* politely describes as “Florida businessmen who are U.S. citizens born in former Soviet republics,” were both carrying one-way tickets out of the country when federal agents [arrested them](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rudy-giulianis-relationship-arrested-men-subject-criminal-investigation/story?id=66212654) at Dulles International Airport, on Wednesday night, and charged them with breaking campaign-finance laws by disguising donations from foreign entities.\n\n> (b) Parnas, a forty-seven-year-old native of Ukraine who arrived in the United States in 1976, owns a company called Fraud Guarantee. Evidently, it’s some sort of fraud-prevention advisory service. According to [the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-associates.html), this company paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for “business and legal advice.”\n\n> (c) According to [Buzzfeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikesallah/rudy-giuliani-ukraine-trump-parnas-fruman), Parnas has in the past “worked for three stockbrokerages that were later expelled by regulators for fraud and other violations—though he was never individually charged—and racked up nine court judgments for failing to pay loans and other debts.”\n\n> (d) Parnas once tried to produce a movie called “Anatomy of an Assassin.” It didn’t go well. “Mr. Parnas is a con man, he is a crook,” Dianne Pues, a New Jersey woman who invested in the project, [told](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article235626327.html) the Miami *Herald*. “He conned us from day one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He financially ruined us.”\n\n> (e) As he travelled around doing whatever he did, Parnas didn’t stint on expenses. “There were bills running to hundreds of dollars at exclusive restaurants such as Novikov in London and BLT Prime in Washington,” Buzzfeed [reported](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikesallah/ukraine-spending-trump-parnas-fruman). “During one of his many trips to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, there was a $657 charge at Tootsie, the popular strip club in the heart of the city.”\n\n> (f) Fruman, a fifty-three-year-old native of Belarus, apparently runs an import-export business that ships goods to and from Ukraine. He also reportedly owned, or owns, a beach club in the Black Sea city of Odessa, which has long been a stronghold of organized crime. The name of the club: Mafia Rave.\n\n> (g) In the spring of last year, after the dynamic duo donated three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars to America First Action, a super *PAC*{:.small} that supports Donald Trump, they were invited to the White House, where they had dinner with the President and got [their pictures](https://twitter.com/propublica/status/1182357387279323139) taken with him. “Thank you President Trump !!! Making America great !!!!!! incredible dinner and even better conversation,” Parnas posted on his Facebook account.\n\n> (h) On Thursday, Trump said, “I don’t know those gentlemen.”\n\nAs I said, it’s a tough choice. On human-interest grounds, I’m choosing Option D, but the grip-and-grin picture of Parnas and Trump at the White House is also priceless—as is a picture of him having coffee with Giuliani at the Trump International Hotel in Washington last month. And let’s not forget the shot of Fruman and Parnas having breakfast in Beverly Hills last year with Donald Trump, Jr., and Tommy Hicks, Jr., a friend of Trump, Jr., who was then running America First Action.\n\nBut humor and Schadenfreude aside, this is a deadly serious matter. While there is still a good deal of murk surrounding the activities of Fruman and Parnas, we do know that they were two very busy and well-connected fellows. In addition to doing some of Giuliani’s bidding in Ukraine, as he sought to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter, Parnas got hired by a law firm run by two other Trump supporters and frequent Fox News guests, Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing. According to the [*Wall Street Journal*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-foreign-born-men-who-helped-giuliani-on-ukraine-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges-11570714188), the law firm “hired Mr. Parnas in July to serve as an interpreter related to their representation of Dmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch, who was detained in Vienna, in 2014, on corruption charges filed in the U.S.”\n\nMeanwhile, Parnas and Fruman were also representing, and acting at the behest of, at least two Eastern European parties who haven’t yet been identified. The [indictment](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/U.S.v.LevParnasetalIndictment.pdf?mod=article_inline) says that their political donations, some of which were routed through shell companies to hide their identities, “were made for the purpose of gaining influence with politicians so as to advance their own personal financial interests and the political interests of Ukrainian government officials, including at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working.” \n\nWho was this Ukrainian official, and what did he or she want? That’s one of the things we don’t know yet, but the indictment says that Parnas met with a U.S. congressman, widely believed to be the former Texas Republican congressman Pete Sessions, and sought his “assistance in causing the U.S. Government to remove or recall the then-U.S. ambassador to Ukraine”—Marie Yovanovitch—and these “efforts to remove the Ambassador were conducted, at least in part, at the request of one or more Ukrainian government officials.” \n\nWe also know that the other Eastern European who was employing Parnas and Fruman is Russian. The indictment says that some of the donations that Fruman, Parnas, and two other individuals made in 2018 were really funded by a certain “Foreign National-1,” with a view to obtaining licenses for a recreational-marijuana business in certain U.S. states, including Nevada. One of the other conspirators is quoted in the indictment, and he says Foreign National-1’s identity was kept hidden because of “his Russian roots and current political paranoia about it.”\n\nWhat does all this add up to? Although Parnas and Fruman hardly appear to fit the bill of men of international intrigue, they clearly played significant roles in the Giuliani-inspired effort to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens, get rid of Yovanovitch, and help Donald Trump get reëlected. That means they are potentially important witnesses in the Presidential-impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe House Democrats who are investigating Trump will most certainly want to hear what Parnas and Fruman have to say. (At least one House committee has already served a subpoena on them.) And, according to ABC News, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the campaign-finance case against Parnas and Fruman, is also investigating their business relationship with Giuliani. That’s not good news for Rudy or Trump.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Virginia ordered the pair to be held in detention until they [secure](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-inquiry-10-10-2019/h_10c49544ade8af0943742f340e377f13) a bail bond of a million dollars each. Right now, they are being represented by John Dowd, a former lawyer for Trump, which would suggest they aren’t about to turn on their former associates and spill.

Bush Administration, despite the fact that she had championed some of the Trump Administration’s harshest immigration policies, including family separation. McAleenan, who had served in the Obama Administration, was widely regarded as a Democrat. He publicly opposed Trump’s decision, earlier that spring, to [cut aid to Central America](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-cycle-of-self-sabotage-at-the-us-border), and was taking over the Department at a moment when more than a hundred thousand migrants were being apprehended at the border in a single month. On Friday, after six months in the post, McAleenan resigned, becoming one of the shortest-serving secretaries in the department’s history. And yet, according to three people with knowledge of McAleenan’s thinking, the Secretary had somehow managed to leave the Trump Administration mostly on his own terms. The reasoning behind the decision, one of them told me, “was sixty per cent because he had achieved the mission objectives, and forty per cent because he had to avoid being branded as Trump’s border cop.”\n\nMcAleenan’s primary goal was reducing immigration to the U.S., which aligned him with the White House. But, unlike Trump or his chief adviser, Stephen Miller, McAleenan was never an anti-immigration ideologue. He is a technocrat and an institutionalist who had spent much of his career at Customs and Border Protection, a D.H.S. sub-agency. In his view, mass migration was a humanitarian crisis which threatened to overtake both D.H.S. resources and the asylum system writ large. It was a problem, he once told me, that partisan Washington was unable to address. At the same time, according to another department official close to him, McAleenan saw Trump’s election as proof that an unsolved immigration crisis could carry dangerous political consequences. \n\nIn terms of immigration numbers, though, McAleenan succeeded where his predecessors failed. He was the fourth person to lead the department in the Trump era but the first with extensive experience on immigration policy. “I wouldn’t make a move or decision in the immigration space without consulting Kevin first,” Jeh Johnson, who headed D.H.S. under President Obama, told me. Each of McAleenan’s predecessors, under sustained pressure from the White House, adopted drastic immigration measures, but immigration at the southern border continued to rise steadily. By the start of 2019, it reached its highest levels in more than a decade. McAleenan responded with a controversial slate of policies that enlisted governments in Central America and Mexico to ramp up their own immigration enforcement. By September, the number of immigrants apprehended at the southern border had declined by sixty-three per cent.\n\nTrump never exactly soured on McAleenan, but he undercut him. For one thing, the President did not formally nominate McAleenan for Senate confirmation, which eroded his standing within the Administration. D.H.S. consists of twenty-two agencies, with an annual budget of fifty billion dollars and some two hundred and forty thousand employees, spanning the Secret Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (*FEMA*{: .small}), the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (*ICE*{: .small}). Its portfolio includes briefs related to domestic terrorism, cybersecurity, and disaster relief. “We always had to work extremely hard to make sure the department didn’t get turned into a political tool,” one former D.H.S. official [told](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-became-one-of-president-trumps-fiercest-loyalists) me last year. “We tried to run it like other departments that were above the fray, but it’ll always be a challenge because of the immigration issue.” Among many current and former D.H.S. officials, however, there was rising concern that the President’s obsessive focus on immigration enforcement was dragging the department even further into the realm of domestic politics. At one point earlier this summer, Trump bumped into McAleenan in Washington just before the secretary was due to give a speech on cybersecurity. “Why aren’t you at the border?” Trump asked him, according to someone present at the time. \n\nIn June, Trump named two partisan appointees to key posts within D.H.S.—Ken Cuccinelli, the former Virginia attorney general, to lead Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, to head C.B.P.—both of whom routinely sidestepped McAleenan, their direct boss, in press conferences and appearances on Fox News. This summer, while McAleenan was negotiating an emergency funding bill on the Hill—in part, by trying to convince restive Democrats that D.H.S. would use appropriations for humanitarian, not enforcement, efforts—Cuccinelli and Morgan publicly championed a nationwide *ICE*{: .small} operation that the President had announced, to the agency’s surprise, on Twitter. McAleenan had opposed the operation, which targeted immigrant families, but Cuccinelli and Morgan rallied to the cause. “What I don’t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time,” McAleenan later told the Washington *Post*. “That’s uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.” \n\nBut if McAleenan passed as a moderate steward of D.H.S. in the context of Trump’s Washington—a policy wonk and diplomat, who was data-driven and cautious—by almost any other standard, his tenure was marked by aggressive measures that have wreaked havoc on the lives of migrants. During the past six months, McAleenan has presided over two elaborate new policies designed to enlist foreign governments in the effort to take pressure off of the U.S. asylum system. The first, called the [Migrant Protection Protocols](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-the-us-asylum-system-is-keeping-migrants-at-risk-in-mexico) (M.P.P.), came into existence while McAleenan was the head of C.B.P. It has since forced some fifty thousand Central American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their legal claims move through the backlogged U.S. immigration courts. Initially, the program was designed to handle the influx of Central Americans, but late this spring, under McAleenan’s leadership, D.H.S. broadened M.P.P. to include asylum seekers from any Spanish-speaking country in Latin America. McAleenan has defended M.P.P. as a necessary stopgap to allow asylum seekers access to U.S. immigration courts, while keeping them off American soil. In practice, however, hundreds of asylum seekers have been brutalized while stranded in notoriously dangerous Mexican border cities, and thousands of others, out of fear for their safety, have abandoned their asylum claims altogether. \n\nOver the summer, I spoke to a twenty-two-year-old Guatemalan named Deysi, whose asylum claim was promising even by the strictest legal definitions of the term. A lesbian who’d been raped and assaulted repeatedly in her home town, in southern Guatemala, she travelled to El Paso to seek relief at a port of entry, and was eventually returned to Juárez, under M.P.P., on the same day that McAleenan took over at D.H.S. She slept in a park because the city’s shelters were full. “I knew I had a court date,” she said in a subsequent affidavit. “But I had no paper with the date, the time, and what I need to do to get to court.” By the end of May, she’d missed her court appearance and run out of money. At that point, she tried crossing the border between points of entry and was arrested by Border Patrol agents. Since she’d missed her previous court hearing, she now had an order of removal. When we spoke, Deysi was back in Guatemala, desperate to leave but too scared to set out again for the U.S. \n\nThe other defining feature of McAleenan’s tenure has been a series of accords known as safe-third-country agreements, which, since July, D.H.S. has [signed with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/does-asylum-have-a-future-at-the-southern-border). Each of these deals will bar migrants from applying for asylum in the U.S. if they have first passed through one of these three Central American countries. Currently, more than ninety per cent of migrants apprehended at the U.S. border are fleeing these countries. They are far from “safe” for migrants, and none of them has a fully functioning asylum system.\n\nThe agreements are designed to send a message to the region’s asylum seekers that if they travel north, the U.S. will no longer be their ultimate destination, a senior D.H.S. official told me. It’s an unconventional version of a familiar argument: deterring migrants from travelling to the U.S. has been the through line of U.S. border policy for decades, linking Republican and Democratic Administrations. McAleenan, for his part, has insisted that there are other upsides to the agreements. They will open the door to tens of millions of dollars in aid to build up asylum infrastructure in Central America; in exchange for regional coöperation, the U.S. will increase the number of temporary work visas available to migrants as well. But ending asylum at the southern border requires rejecting the legitimacy of thousands of future claims. “Every person I’ve ever met at C.B.P. fundamentally believes that ninety-nine per cent of asylum claims are what a smuggler convinced people to say,” one Administration official told me, referring to the Secretary’s background. “McAleenan is comfortable with effectively ending asylum because he thinks a lot of these claims are fraudulent.” \n\nMcAleenan has defended the implementation of M.P.P., and the continued “[metering](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-long-wait-for-tijuanas-migrants-to-process-their-own-asylum-claims)” of asylum seekers at official ports of entry, by pointing out that no one else has yet managed to offer a holistic solution to the Central American exodus while preserving the key tenets of U.S. asylum law. But his initiatives have come with an irreparable human cost. “Again and again, under his leadership, the Department of Homeland Security has evaded U.S. asylum laws and policies designed to protect men, women, and children from persecution and comply with this country’s treaty commitments,” Eleanor Acer, of Human Rights First, told me. “Instead of a system that assesses whether people meet the requirements of U.S. refugee protection, the U.S. now has a system designed to evade U.S. refugee law, block as many as possible from asylum in our country, and terrify others into abandoning their requests for protection.”\n\nOne of McAleenan’s few regrets was his initial support for the zero-tolerance policy that gave rise to family separation. He co-wrote the memo recommending the policy to Nielsen, in the spring of 2018. He described his original rationale, in an interview he gave to the Washington *Post*. “How can we let these smugglers victimize these desperate families,” he said. “How can we let this flow continue to grow.” Family separation was supposed to have a deterrent effect. It [didn’t work](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/will-anyone-in-the-trump-administration-ever-be-held-accountable-for-the-zero-tolerance-policy), and instead tortured thousands of families in the process. “When you see the impact in the six-week period on two thousand and five hundred or so families and understand the emotional pain for those children, it’s not worth it,” McAleenan would later say. “It’s the one part of this whole thing that I couldn’t ever be part of again.” \n\nFor now, it seems likely that either Cuccinelli or Morgan will replace McAleenan. Both of them have been auditioning for the job for months. With either of them at the helm, D.H.S. runs the risk of becoming an overt arm of the Trump reëlection campaign, which is a genuinely frightening prospect. Going into 2020, the Trump Administration faces a messaging dilemma when it comes to immigration policy: the President has campaigned on the idea that the U.S. border is being overrun, but since the Administration has effectively [ended asylum](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-immigration-attorney-at-the-aclu-on-fighting-trumps-asylum-ban) there isn’t an obvious case to fuel the sense of emergency. Neither Cuccinelli nor Morgan has any grasp of policy, but they’re in their element as the President’s spokesmen—threatening mass roundups, boasting about enforcement operations, and unquestioningly parroting falsehoods from the White House. That is what Trump clearly wants, even more than the results he was able to get with McAleenan. We’ll never know all the outlandish policies McAleenan probably had to avert, redirect, or quietly defuse during his tenure at D.H.S. Now, without him there, we’re about to find out.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Immigration","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"immigration"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"News Desk","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Nearly all of them had been deported from the United States in the previous six months, including the pastor, Mabel González. She had been [separated](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-uncounted-families-torn-apart-at-the-border-by-the-trump-administration) from two of her children in September of 2017, in El Paso, where she was detained for more than a year. Now she was calling the group to prayer with an exhortation: “You have to say, ‘I’m not going to let anything bad overtake me.’&nbsp;” The room was small and dimly lit, with pocked floors, bare walls, and a fold-out table littered with empty juice bottles; a small pink fan wheezed in the corner. Seated in a half circle, members of the group shared stories of their time in U.S. detention. “I’m still traumatized,” Luis Bonilla, a man in his early forties, said. He’d been transferred among detention centers in Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, and Georgia, and, after falling gravely ill while in custody, he signed what’s called a voluntary-departure order, abandoning his asylum claim. “I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “And now I have to go back! It gives me the chills. It enrages me. But I can’t stay at home. We are living the crisis in Honduras in the flesh.”\n\nThose Hondurans came to mind last week, when the Department of Homeland Security announced the latest in a series of accords that it has been signing with nations in Central America. Known as safe-third-country agreements, they will force migrants travelling to the U.S. to apply for asylum in the first country they enter on their route. Then, if they reach American soil, the U.S. government, rather than allowing them to apply for asylum in this country, will be able to send them back to that first (i.e., third) country, on the grounds that they should have pursued their claims there. The latest signatory was Honduras, whose government, led by President Juan Orlando Hernández, is notorious for corruption and repression. He himself has been accused of bankrolling past political campaigns with drug money, and his brother is currently standing [trial](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/world/americas/el-chapo-honduras-drug-trial.html) in New York on drug-trafficking charges. (President Hernández has denied any involvement in drug crimes; his brother has pleaded not guilty.) Since 2013, when Hernández became President, tens of thousands of Hondurans have left the country, to escape gang violence, a cratered economy, and political mismanagement. This past year, roughly two hundred thousand Hondurans have been apprehended at the U.S. border. \n\nUnder the new agreements, which are set to go into effect sometime in the coming months, the U.S. will be sending asylum seekers to the same countries that most of the region’s migrants are already fleeing. In addition to Honduras, this is true of Guatemala and El Salvador, with which the U.S. signed analogous agreements in July and September, respectively. During the past year, ninety-two per cent of all immigrants apprehended at the southern border were families from these three countries; none of them has an asylum system capable of handling an influx of tens of thousands of people. In Guatemala, according to [Human Rights First](https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/guatemala-safe-refugees-and-asylum-seekers), there are twelve government officials working on the asylum process, and only three who conduct asylum interviews. Last year, the government approved just twenty asylum claims. \n\nThe implementation of the agreements still needs to be worked out, but the terms create an interlocking set of restrictions on the flow of migrants to the U.S. Hondurans and Salvadorans will have to apply for asylum in Guatemala. Asylum seekers from elsewhere in Latin America will be forced to stop in El Salvador or Honduras. For the time being, they are the southernmost countries to have signed safe-third-country agreements. This summer, the Department of Homeland Security tried to negotiate a deal with Panama—which officials describe as the “chokepoint of the isthmus”—but the government balked. If a deal with Mexico goes through, as the Administration hopes, Guatemalans will have to seek asylum there. \n\nWhen I sat down with the Honduran migrants, only the Guatemalan deal had been signed, and the U.S. government’s broader plans for the region were still an abstract prospect. The reason the Hondurans were in Tapachula was to apply for visas so that they could move through Mexico to the U.S. After being deported back to Honduras, they had travelled north immediately. Stopping in Guatemala wasn’t an option. They knew the country, having travelled through it multiple times; they had bribed border agents there and ducked local criminals. In addition, jobs were nonexistent there, which was why more people were leaving Guatemala than Honduras, and the Honduran gangs that many in the group were fleeing also had extensive operations in Guatemala. Mexico hadn’t been much better. Violence against migrants has raged for years, particularly in areas controlled by the cartels, and a Trump Administration policy called the [Migrant Protection Protocols](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-the-us-asylum-system-is-keeping-migrants-at-risk-in-mexico) has exacerbated the situation along Mexico’s northern border. A former bank teller in his early twenties, named Henry, who was seeking to make the trip north with his wife and toddler, told me, “I did some field work here, but they took advantage of me because I was a foreigner.” For fourteen hours’ labor, he was paid eighty pesos, roughly four U.S. dollars. The only person in the group who had found viable work, doing construction and carpentry, is now trying to leave Tapachula, because a local group has begun extorting him. \n\nThere are two currents now shaping U.S. immigration policy in the Trump Administration. One emanates from Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of D.H.S., who is the architect of the safe-third-country agreements. (His days in the job may be numbered, however. He recently told the Washington *Post*, “What I don’t have control over is the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarized time.”) The other comes from the White House, where, the *Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/us/politics/trump-border-wars.html) this week, the President has called for electrified fences, skin-piercing spikes, and alligator-filled moats to keep migrants from crossing the border, and his senior adviser, Stephen Miller, has been crafting the most punishing policies to come out of the executive branch in decades. In July, while D.H.S. officials were negotiating the terms of the agreement with Guatemala, the White House went ahead and issued  a regulation that would effectively end asylum altogether. The regulation states that, unless asylum seekers at the southern border have already tried to apply for asylum in another country, they will be turned away. (A federal judge immediately blocked it, but last month the Supreme Court [allowed](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-immigration-attorney-at-the-aclu-on-fighting-trumps-asylum-ban) the policy to go into effect while it is being challenged in court.) The move was typical of the White House, in that it ignored the potential fallout in Central America. McAleenan’s strategy shares the same core logic of curtailing asylum at the U.S. border, but, he says, he has tried to engage with the larger issues. This summer, in Guatemala City, where he was meeting with local groups to sell the safe-third-country deal, he told reporters, “You can’t address migration flows at a single destination point. You’ve got to have a partnership between the source, transit, and destination countries. The history, globally, of irregular migration has proven that.” In the past several months, through a separate series of security accords signed with other countries in the region, he achieved significant results: the number of people apprehended at the border each month has dropped by two-thirds, mostly owing to enforcement initiatives undertaken with Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nHow should the U.S. be responding to migrants like those I met in Tapachula? By the limited terms of current U.S. asylum law, few of them have claims that would win in immigration court. And, since many of them have been deported before, the chance that they might gain lawful entry this time is unlikely. In defense of the safe-third-country agreements, the Department of Homeland Security argues that the asylum system is being flooded by claims that will be rejected anyway. “The bulk of these people are economic migrants,” a senior Administration official told me, and as such, under current U.S. law, they do not qualify for legal protection. At the same time, the government also views people fleeing gang or domestic violence, who make up the vast majority of asylum cases from Central America, as largely ineligible as well. Here the legal reasoning is that asylum seekers must belong to “particular social group” and be persecuted because of their identity or political beliefs. While immigration jurisprudence has expanded slightly over the years to broaden the understanding of what constitutes such a “social group,” the Trump Administration’s Department of Justice has worked relentlessly to reverse such gains. “Only ten to fifteen per cent of the Central Americans seeking asylum in the U.S. actually get it,” the official told me, and if the government does not try to curb the flow, authorities at the border will continue to be overwhelmed by more migrants than the system was ever equipped to handle. So, “the short-term goal” of the safe-third-country deals “is deterrence,” the official said, but added that “the long-term goal is to set the stage for investment and development in the region. There has to be a way for people to live in the hemisphere. It can’t just be the U.S. and Canada.” \n\nAccording to the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/acting-homeland-security-chief-frustrated-and-isolated--even-as-he-delivers-what-trump-wants-at-the-border/2019/10/01/b62e740c-e3ad-11e9-b403-f738899982d2_story.html), “McAleenan sees the accords as an alternative to the president’s previous impulse to cut off the region entirely.” The deal with Guatemala was supposed to include benefits for Guatemalans, in the form of promises to “double or triple” the five thousand temporary agricultural visas currently issued by the U.S. each year. There’s also a proposal to build the country’s asylum capacity, taken from a plan drafted last year by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. It will allocate forty-seven million dollars designed to help the country build shelters, hire more staff to handle claims, and open more asylum offices. But whether these proposals are realistic and can be implemented anytime soon is an open question; Guatemala has not yet instituted any such plans. \n\nIn fact, although the senior official I spoke with stressed that the accords were a step toward “making regional governments more accountable and responsive” to the issue of migration, the effect so far seems to have been opportunism from the leaders of the countries involved. Earlier this summer, the  Constitutional Court in Guatemala had blocked the President, Jimmy Morales, from signing the agreement without the approval of the national Congress. Morales, who will leave office in January, was trying to finalize the deal because “he wanted to end his time as close as he could to the U.S.,” someone with knowledge of the negotiations told me. (Members of his family were tried on corruption charges, but were cleared in August; Morales himself faced investigation for alleged campaign-finance improprieties, which he denied.) After the Court checked Morales, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on the country, and Morales signed the agreement in direct contravention of the Court’s order. A few weeks later, in August, Guatemala held the second round of its Presidential [elections](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-trump-administrations-self-defeating-policy-toward-the-guatemalan-elections). The winner was Alejandro Giammattei, a right-wing  former national-prison director, who had publicly opposed the safe-third-country deal but has privately assured the U.S that he will allow it to proceed, according to someone with knowledge of his position. In El Salvador, President Nayib Bukele was seemingly so eager to curry favor with the Trump Administration that he accepted the deal without bothering to push for significant concessions. There are currently two hundred thousand Salvadorans living in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status, which the Trump Administration has tried to cancel. According to another senior Administration official, Bukele signed the deal even though the U.S. refused, outright, to extend T.P.S. for these Salvadorans. \n\nThere is a crisis facing the U.S. asylum system, and it’s been decades in the making. But ending asylum as we know it creates a crisis all its own. González, the Honduran pastor, is now living two hours outside of Ciudad Juárez, in northern Mexico. Her mother, husband, and children are in the U.S.; a nephew who’d also been in Tapachula is joining her; and she’s hired a lawyer to review her asylum case. Gangsters in Honduras murdered six of her family members over the past two decades, including two of her brothers. She has no more family left in the country. “They’ve all been killed or driven out,” she said. Earlier this year, after the U.S. deported her, she stayed with the closest person she had there to a relative—the mother of another asylum seeker whom she had met in detention, in El Paso.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d4b81ab3335f580f222","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Honduras","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"honduras"},{"id":"5c2e1f9caef5062c9d94aba0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Guatemala","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"guatemala"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a7e716b454591ae79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Salvador","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-salvador"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

For weeks, the government denied them food and kept them from seeing doctors or family members. The circumstances, one of the girls later told the [*Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/us/flores-migrant-children-detention.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmiriam-jordan&action=click&contentCollection=undefined&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection), were “too painful to remember, to discuss.” A team of lawyers who went on to represent them and two other girls sued the government, in a case that dragged on for more than a decade, well after the initial plaintiffs were released. By 1997, two Presidential Administrations later, the government decided to settle. Doris Meissner, who was then the head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said, “If there are real issues surrounding the detention of minors, and the government is being held responsible for poor conditions, why are we litigating in favor of what we are doing wrong?”  \n\nFor the past twenty-two years, the terms of this legal settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, have been a central tenet of U.S. immigration policy. When dealing with children, the most vulnerable immigrants to enter federal custody, the government must provide certain, baseline protections, including access to food and medical care; it must also promise to detain them for the shortest possible amount of time, in the “least restrictive” settings. \n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a sweeping new set of regulations to gut the Flores Agreement. “It is a wholesale attack on kids in custody,” Jennifer Podkul, the policy director of Kids in Need of Defense (*KIND*{: .small}), told me. The Administration’s immediate target is an outgrowth of the agreement, shored up by a judge a few years ago, which prevents children from being held in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security for more than twenty days. The agreement applies not just to children who came to the U.S. alone but also to those who crossed the border with their parents. This has meant, in effect, that thousands of asylum-seeking families have been released from detention while their cases have moved through the immigration courts. Now, according to Kevin McAleenan, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, the government will detain families together for as long as it takes to resolve their immigration claims. For tens of thousands of families, that could easily amount to months in custody—an especially alarming prospect considering that another critical component of Flores, a requirement that the government keep children in licensed facilities overseen by independent monitors, would also fall away under the Administration’s plan. \n\nIn his announcement on Wednesday, McAleenan claimed that “all children in U.S. government custody” would be “treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.” But his reassurances sound especially hollow at the present moment. In the past year and a half, seven children have died in immigration custody, and there have been widespread complaints about the conditions in which children are being held. Earlier this summer, at a Border Patrol facility in [Clint](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/inside-a-texas-building-where-the-government-is-holding-immigrant-children), Texas, two hundred and fifty infants, children, and teen-agers spent weeks without adequate food and water, and were denied soap and toothbrushes; despite lice and flu outbreaks, authorities skimped on providing medical care. “The Flores monitors are the reason we knew about what was happening at Clint,” Podkul said. \n\nOn Monday, a lawyer known as a “special master,” who was appointed last year to investigate potential violations of Flores in facilities run by D.H.S. and the Department of Health and Human Services, filed a report with further details. In Customs and Border Protection facilities, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, “allegations of severe overcrowding and excessive length of custody, lack of appropriate food for minors, inability of detainees to sleep, ambient temperatures outside a reasonably comfortable range, and lack of access to medical treatment remain unresolved,” the special master wrote. At H.H.S. shelters across the country, the average time that children spent in government custody, between January of 2018 and May of 2019, was sixty-seven days. Nearly three thousand children who turned eighteen while in detention were transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement because they “aged out” and were no longer treated as minors.   \n\nThe Trump Administration has, from the start, attacked Flores as a “loophole” that immigrant families have continually sought to exploit; closing it was part of a broader mission to deter other families from coming to the U.S. to seek asylum in the first place. In August, 2017, a group of Administration officials [met](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-trump-administration-got-comfortable-separating-immigrant-kids-from-their-parents) at D.H.S. headquarters, in Washington, to devise a series of policies to restrict the number of asylum seekers entering the country. Among the proposals was separating families at the border and a move to end the Flores agreement. Attendees were also tasked with writing ten separate memos with blueprints for how the Administration could implement each policy goal. “I recall being stumped about what we could do by decree or executive action to get around Flores,” one former official, who was present at the meeting, told me. “It was one of the memos that floundered,” the former official added, because of its “questionable legality.” \n\nThe White House decided to work around Flores instead. When the Trump Administration began separating families at the border, in the summer of 2017, part of its rationalization was that, by criminally charging parents for entering the country illegally, the government could detain the adults, and their children would be treated as unaccompanied minors and transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. The government could thus hold the parents indefinitely and penalize the entire family, as the children were kept in conditions that were notionally consistent with the terms of Flores. By late June, 2018, amid a national outcry, Trump promised to stop separating families at the border. But, in the same breath, he announced that the Administration would hold families together instead. Almost immediately, a federal judge in California named Dolly Gee, who is in charge of supervising the government’s compliance with Flores, blocked the Administration. There was a clear precedent for her decision, which the Trump Administration willfully ignored: in 2015, when President Obama responded to a sudden spike in Central American families seeking asylum by trying to detain families in *ICE*{: .small} facilities, Gee blocked him, too. \n\nIn September, 2018, the Trump Administration released a two-hundred-page document outlining proposed regulations that would end Flores altogether. Immigration advocates immediately appealed to Gee, in California, who took the challenge under advisement but withheld final judgment until after the Administration’s regulations were entered in the federal register, which is slated for Friday. “The President is telling [D.H.S.] they must terminate the settlement,” Peter Schey, one of the lead attorneys in the initial Flores class-action suit, [told the Washington *Post* at the time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-to-circumvent-court-limits-on-detention-of-child-migrants/2018/09/06/181d376c-b1bd-11e8-a810-4d6b627c3d5d_story.html). “They tried it in court, and now they’re trying it through regulations. But they’re in a bind, because the only way the regulations will be valid is if they’re consistent with the settlement, and if they’re consistent with the settlement then they won’t achieve the changes the President has demanded.” Now the Flores plaintiffs will have a week to amend their suit. Jennifer Nagda, an attorney at the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, told me, “We’ll have to do a line-by-line comparison between the new regulations and the proposed version from last September to decide how to direct our energy in the next seven days.”\n\nThe broader consequences of the Administration’s rollback could extend well beyond detention conditions. When minors travel to the U.S. alone, for instance, they’re categorized as unaccompanied, a designation that affords them additional rights such as the ability to apply for asylum through an asylum officer, as opposed to a judge in the more adversarial setting of an immigration court. “This isn’t just about being detained,” Podkul said. “It’s about the next two to three years an immigrant child spends going through the judicial system.” Earlier this summer, an official at H.H.S.—who at the time suspected that the President’s senior adviser, Stephen Miller, was behind an unprecedented push to reclassify unaccompanied children—told me, “The expectation is that the Administration will change the policy regarding the definition of an unaccompanied child.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A child arriving at the border alone will not be declared unaccompanied if they have a parent ‘available’ in the U.S. to care for them. That means the child will be subject to expedited removal.” The idea, the official added, was to skirt Congress by instituting the change in the form of a regulation, while creating yet another pretext for assailing lawmakers for their failure to take some radical action of their own. And that is exactly what has happened: the regulations announced this week will further whittle away the legal rights of immigrant children. “The change will end up in court immediately,” the official had told me. But the Administration wanted to send a message anyway.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c934a08312cd3aa6c5d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Department of Homeland Security","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"department-of-homeland-security"},{"id":"5c2e1c9cb75f002c8941e4a9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.
