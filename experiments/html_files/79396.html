<p align="center" class="small">The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath Trail</p>
<p align="left">The Towpath Trail was constructed in the flood plain between the canal and the Cuyahoga River.  Heavy rain can cause flooding or lead to erosion on the trail, which can make more expensive repairs necessary.  If you would like to check for trail closings, you can find links to each section here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150510124156/http://www.ohioanderiecanalway.com/Main/Pages/9.aspx" target="_blank">Canalway Alerts</a>.</p>
<p align="left">The Towpath Trail and surrounding parks are extremely popular.  The section in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park alone sees over 2 million visitors each year.</p>
<p align="left">To help those travelers, the park systems have the Towpath Trail patrolled by park rangers and volunteers.  These bike patrols ride the Towpath Trail to offer assistance with emergencies and information to visitors.</p>

<h2 align="left">The History</h2>
<p align="left">The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal and Towpath Trail is an important piece of Ohio history, and helped make Ohio the great state it is today!</p>
<p align="left">The canal and trail was originally 309 miles long and constructed in 7 years—from 1825 from 1832.  The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal was one of the longest canals ever built.  It was hand dug by Irish and German immigrants, who were paid $0.30 per day.</p>
<p align="left">The Towpath Trail that we use today, which follows the old canal, originally served as a path for the horses and mules pulling the canal boats.  Because of this, most canal boats did not move very fast.  In fact, to help prevent damage to the canal, the state even imposed a speed limit of 4 MPH—that's the average speed most adults run.</p>
<p align="left">The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal was a massive undertaking, and originally built to create a link between Lake Erie and the Ohio River so that farmers could get their goods to markets as far away as New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>
