<p><strong>July 31, 1991: START I signed</strong> - Presidents George H.W. Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev sign the “Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms" (START I), which calls for the United States and the Soviet Union to reduce their strategic nuclear forces over seven years to 1,600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles and 6,000 “accountable” warheads, of which no more than 4,900 may be on ballistic missiles.</p>

<p><strong>May 23, 1992: START protocol signed</strong> - The United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine sign the START Protocol at a ceremony in Portugal. Under the protocol, all five countries become parties to START, and the three non-Russian former Soviet republics agree to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as non-nuclear-weapon states “<em>in the shortest possible time</em>.” In addition to the protocol, in letters to President Bush, the heads of the three republics pledge to eliminate all the strategic weapons on their territories within the seven-year START reduction period.</p>
<p><strong>January 3, 1993: START II signed</strong> - Presidents Bush and Boris Yeltsin meet in Moscow and sign the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russia Federation on the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Arms (START II).

<p><strong>December 5, 1994: START I instruments of ratification</strong> - The five parties to the START I Treaty -- the United States, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine -- exchange instruments of ratification for START I at the Budapest Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe summit.

They agree that START III negotiations will include a limit of 2,000-2,500 deployed strategic nuclear warheads for each side by December 31, 2007, measures relating to the transparency of strategic nuclear warhead inventories and to the destruction of strategic warheads, extension of the current START agreements to unlimited duration, and the deactivation by the end of 2003 of all strategic nuclear delivery vehicles to be eliminated under START II.</p>
<p><strong>April 14, 2000: Duma ratifies START II</strong> - The Russian Duma (lower house of parliament) ratifies START II.</p>

<p><strong>March 6, 2009: Clinton-Lavrov meeting</strong> - Secretary of State Hilary Clinton presents Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov with a symbolic reset button, stating “<em>I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama, Vice President Biden and I have been saying. We want to reset our relationship, and so we will do it together</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>April 1, 2009: Obama-Medvedev meeting</strong> - Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev meet in London and issue a Joint Statement in which they agree “<em>to pursue new and verifiable reductions in our strategic offensive arsenals in a step-by-step process, beginning by replacing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new, legally-binding treaty.

<p><strong>April 5, 2009: Obama Prague speech</strong> - President Obama delivers a major speech on nuclear weapons in Prague, in which he states: “<em>To reduce our warheads and stockpiles, we will negotiate a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Russians this year….that is legally binding and sufficiently bold.
