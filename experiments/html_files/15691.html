He had bought the building three years earlier on the advice of his father, an accountant who considered distressed real estate a smart long-term bet. This piece of real estate seemed to test the proposition. It was a bedraggled three-story clapboard house that years of neighborhood demolition and neglect had stranded at the edge of several mostly vacant blocks, which together formed an urban badlands reaching all the way to the dunes. This was the South Inlet, a once thriving part of town and now more or less a desolate slum at the northeastern end of Absecon Island, the landmass that is home to Atlantic City and three other municipalities. People from âoffshore,â as locals like to call the mainland, tend to think of the islandâs Inlet end as north, because itâs upcoast, but locals call it east. Atlantic City has a Bermuda Triangle effect; it can confound a compass.</p><p>Three blocks west of Haukeâs place, an immense slab of steel and glass was rising over the badlands: a hotel and casino to be called Revel, destined to be bigger and more opulent than anything Atlantic City had ever seenâtwo towers, reaching almost fifty stories, nearly four thousand rooms, and parking for more than seven thousand cars. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, had bought the land in 2006, for seventy million dollars, and sunk about $1.2 billion into the project. (Revel, as some have noted, is âleverâ spelled backward.) By the end, the cost of building Revel reached more than $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive private construction project in the history of New Jersey.</p><p>Hauke went after the crumbs. Unable to find a commercial tenant for his houseâs ground floor (the apartments upstairs were designated Section 8, for low-income tenants), he started selling rudimentary takeout to Revelâs construction crews. Their rush-hour bulk orders overwhelmed his staff, but off hours the place was dead: a trickle of casino workers and, in Haukeâs words, âshitbags, crackheads, hustlers, and pimps.â</p><p>Hauke, a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had spent a couple of years in Hoboken and Manhattan working in marketing, but he had no restaurant experience. One of his first customers was a neighborhood junkie known as V8 Man (âAll the white kids are junkies,â Hauke said. âThe Inlet does it to everybodyâ), who, on opening night, picked a fight at the counter with a male prostitute and another customer; Hauke smashed a pizza paddle on the counter and used the sharp end to scare him off. More than once, a guy came in trying to unload stolen merchandise as the victimized storekeeper came running up the street in pursuit. One morning, a neighborhood kid rode by on a bicycle and threw a crude pipe bomb through the window; Hauke chased him in his car and, after cornering him briefly in an abandoned house, hounded him on foot across a vacant tract called Paulineâs Prairie, named after Pauline Hill, a city planner in the sixties whoâd had this stretch of the neighborhood bulldozed for urban renewal, which never came. The kid, looking over his shoulder, ran into the side of a parked box truck. The police appeared and put him in cuffs. His grievance was that cops had been patronizing Haukeâs shop and that sheriffs had evicted his cousins, Haukeâs Section 8 tenants, from one of the apartments upstairs. The tenants, according to Hauke, had been running a welfare scam. Theyâd also been throwing dirty diapers on his customers and fishing for pigeons from the roof.</p><p>Hauke hoped that, in spite of such annoyances, Revel would either provide him with an income stream or else buy him out. A few neighborhood property owners said that it would never happen. Theyâd been holding on for years themselves, in the hope of selling to a big casino, and in the interim theyâd been gutted by rising property taxes and ongoing decay. The problem was that the area was zoned for big casino-hotels. You couldnât build a house, and the few houses left in the neighborhoodâmost had been demolished or had burned down, accidentally or notâwere old and badly battered by the salt air. One of them, down near the beach, across the street from a run-down low-income housing complex called the Waterside, belonged to a teacher Hauke had got to know named Tony Zarych, whoâd moved to Atlantic City as a teen-ager forty years earlier, when his family was buying up property around town. Heâd worked as a baccarat dealer at the Sands, until it closed (it was demolished in 2007), and now taught English as a second language at an elementary school. He liked to hunt wild turkey offshore and sometimes had carcasses hanging outside. His property taxes had risen sharply, as the city contended with a steep drop in tax revenues from the casinos. âGet out while you can,â Zarych told Hauke.</p><p>Sure enough, in 2009, amid the financial meltdown, Revel, only half built, ran out of money. In April, 2010, Morgan Stanley quit the project, booking a loss of almost a billion dollars. Construction stopped. Haukeâs business withered. âThere were no more tourists or construction workers,â he recalled. âMostly just cops. And crackheads wanting free shit.â But<span data-page="page_2"></span> something about the city, and about the Inletâs seaside squalor, made him want to stay on. Maybe it was the fact that his great-grandmother had attended shul in the Inlet. Or that heâd simply got sand in his shoes, as the locals say about those who take to the place.</p><p>After grinding along for another year, Hauke shut down the shop, spiffed it up, and rechristened it Tony Boloneyâs. He bought a food truck, which he named the Mustache Mobile, and developed a line of pizzas and novelty subs that he marketed as âindigenous Atlantic City grub,â as though heâd revived an obscure provincial cuisine. Soon, Tony Boloneyâs began winning foodie awards and luring in not just gamblers, night-clubbers, food-truck connoisseurs, politicians, and cops but also a procession of casino magnates and real-estate speculators who were visiting the neighborhood, often on the sly, to size up the distressed property next door.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>At the beginning of 2011, Governor Chris Christie pledged tax incentives to Revel worth more than a quarter of a billion dollars. (The incentives were tied to certain revenue targets, which, in the end, Revel failed to meet.) Christie had evidently decided that Revelâs success was essential to the survival of Atlantic City, and therefore his gubernatorial track record. His pledge helped Revel secure new financing from an array of hedge funds, including Chatham Asset Management and Canyon Capital, which manage hundreds of millions of dollars in New Jersey state pension funds.</p><p>Construction resumed, and Christie came to town. After a photo op at a famous sub shop called the White House and a visit to the Revel site, he dropped in at Tony Boloneyâs and urged Hauke to keep the place going. âListen, you gotta stick around,â Christie told him. The Revel executives were emphatic as well: âItâll look bad if you close. Please donât go anywhere.â The head of Chatham Asset Management hired Hauke to cater his annual Halloween party, up in Essex County.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a19462"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63ee7206a168e2d17779/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19462.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63ee7206a168e2d17779/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19462.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63ee7206a168e2d17779/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19462.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63ee7206a168e2d17779/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19462.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63ee7206a168e2d17779/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_a19462.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âI understand youâve spent the summer on someoneâs ass.

(She also took over the Presidential Suite, relegating Michelle Obama and her daughters to another suite.) The plan had been scaled backâjust fourteen hundred rooms, and one tower instead of two. The towerâs midsection had a half-dozen stories not yet built out; you could see clear through it. Still, it was an impressive building, with sleek, airy marbled atriums and lobbies that had little in common with the smoky, windowless, carpeted caverns of the older mega-casinos down the boardwalk. Unlike all the rest, it directed oneâs attention to the ocean and had ample outdoor space, a two-acre terrace with firepits and cabanas. Even from the outside, Revel had an ethereal appeal. The reflective glass took on the skyâs hue and became almost invisible at dusk, a stealth casino guarding the edge of town.</p><p>If only. During construction, a tower crane collapsed. Lightning struck a workerâs cement bucket and killed him. Three top Revel executives died in a plane crash. A guest plunged from one of several escalators that climbed vertiginously through the heart of the lobby. A couple were found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a suite. The N.F.L. player Ray Rice punched out his fiancÃ©e in an elevator, and the surveillance video went viral.</p><p>The casino wasnât making nearly as much money as the developers had anticipated. Some observers blamed the layoutâthe hotel-room elevators didnât access the casino floor, and a long, tortuous trip from the entrance to the check-in desk didnât take you through it, eitherâor the fact that Revel prohibited smoking, or that its slot machines didnât seem to pay out, or that it was stingy with the comps. Even though occupancy was decent and the night clubs and restaurants were busy, the tables and slots werenât taking in enough to offset the cost of operating the placeâthe burden of debt service, high property taxes, bad leases with the tenants, and an expensive arrangement for power and light. Within a year of opening, Revel filed for bankruptcy. It restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, but the economics still didnât make sense, and so, in the spring of 2014, it went bankrupt once again. Finally, last September, unable to find a buyer, it closed.</p><p>From the time Morgan Stanley began searching in vain for equity partners, Revel had been in play, and all along Tony Boloneyâs had served as an informal commissary for would-be investors and buyers. Among those whom Hauke and his staff said theyâd seen were Steve Wynn, who had sold the Golden Nugget in 1987 and vowed never to come back; various hedge-funders from New York; and a group of Chinese menâthe Export-Import Bank of China was at one point in talks to buy a pieceâwho took over Haukeâs tables and held meetings for hours, without ordering anything.</p><p>A mysterious character in tattered clothing and a handlebar mustache had been showing up a few times a year, engaging the staff in conversation about space travel and Elon Musk. He claimed to represent someone who was going to buy Revel. Hauke and his team were skeptical, but one day last summer, just before the casino closed, the man rolled up in a baby-blue Bentley convertible. Maybe he was for real. âMy guyâs going to offer ninety million,â he said. His guy,<span data-page="page_3"></span> he went on, was from Florida and intended to erect a âTower of Geniusesâ on the Revel site, a high-rise think tank, which would draw on <em class="small">NASA</em> and the federal governmentâs aviation-research facility at Atlantic City Airport, just offshore.</p><p>If not for zany schemes, Atlantic City would still be a sand dune. Within weeks, news broke that a little-known Florida developer named Glenn Straub, the owner of Palm Beach Polo Golf and Country Club, had offered ninety million dollars to buy Revel. Straub wanted to put up the aborted second tower and fill it with academics and scientists charged with solving the worldâs problems: your Tower of Geniuses. Few in town took this seriously, but, as far as the bankruptcy was concerned, heâd established a baseline. Everything has a clearing price. The bad news was that Straubâs offer was less than four cents on the dollarâa chilling signal of how far Atlantic City had fallen and may yet fall. The good news was that the buildingâand you might even say the townâwas worth anything at all.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Most cities exist as a consequence of commercial or strategic utility. Atlantic City is more of a proposition and a ploy. The town fathers of Cape May, the first American seaside resort, werenât interested in a railway, or perhaps the class of people whoâd ride in on oneâthe well-to-do arrived from Philadelphia by boatâso a group of investors built, in 1854, what became known as a ârailroad to nowhere,â to a spot a little way up the coast that was more or less the shortest possible distance from Philadelphia to the sea. Over the decades, and with the industrial-era advent of leisure time and disposable income, this forsaken wedge of salt marsh and sand became âthe worldâs playgroundââa crucible of conspicuous consumption and a stage for the aspirations and masquerades of visitors and entrepreneurs. In some respects, Atlantic City was where America learned how to turn idle entertainment into big business. For a while, it was home to some of the worldâs grandest hotels (the Marlborough-Blenheim was the largest reinforced-concrete building in the world, and was later imploded in the music video for Bruce Springsteenâs âAtlantic Cityâ), as well as some of its more ardent iniquities and diversions. The night clubs were as often as not fronts for backroom gambling halls, intermittently tolerated by the authorities.</p><p>The city, like so many, has its racial demons. At the turn of the twentieth century, Atlantic City had one of the highest African-American populations of any city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, owing to the abundance of jobs in the hotels. The archetypal amusement was that of white working-class visitors kicking back in the boardwalkâs famous wicker rolling chairs while black people did the pushingâa âpublic performance of racial dominance,â notes the historian Bryant Simon, in âBoardwalk of Dreams.â Though the Northside, traditionally a black neighborhood, had been a thriving district, the decline in tourism to the city, after the Second World War, hit it hard. With the rise of affordable air travel, people started going to Florida and the Caribbean instead. The city desegregated. Disneyland opened.</p><p>Legalized gambling was supposed to rescue the city from its obsolescence as a resort and convention town, a condition that came to national attention during the 1964 Democratic Convention there and grew more conspicuous as the decade wore on. A dozen years later, the state passed the Casino Control Act, which was, at least ostensibly, an attempt to reverse the decline. But, perhaps predictably, a lot of the money that flowed in flowed right back outâto the casino operators and their financing schemes (âI made a lot of money in Atlantic City,â Donald Trump said at the recent Republican debate. âAnd Iâm very proud of itâ) and to their subsequent efforts to lobby for the approval of casino gambling in other states. New Jersey, which taxes the casinos to fund a seniorsâ prescription-drug program, among other things, always got its piece.</p><p>Neglect of the city has been attributed to a bloated municipal payrollâa budget nearly double what it was ten years agoâand the years of corruption and mismanagement in city government. Some blame the suffocating effect of the casinos, which are boxed off from the city and are designed to keep patrons inside losing money rather than outside spending it. Others point to the thorny old problem of race or the dreary question of the structure of municipal government statewide.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a19408"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f07206a168e2d1777f/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19408.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f07206a168e2d1777f/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19408.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f07206a168e2d1777f/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19408.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f07206a168e2d1777f/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19408.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f07206a168e2d1777f/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_a19408.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âHeâs very self-loathing, but not enough.â</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19408&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19408&amp;text=a19408&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20a19408&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>The dividing line between south and north, and between white and black, used to be Atlantic Avenue, the main commercial street, which runs parallel to the sea. It was where South Jersey shopped for wedding dresses and jewelry; now itâs a gantlet of shabby storefronts and fast-food joints, running toward and away from the New Jersey Transit bus terminal. In the streets that run from the boardwalk, dilapidation and squalor are not hard to find. Woodâs Loan Office, a pawnshop established in 1927, is owned and operated by Martin Wood, a seventy-nine-year-old Atlantic City native. Wood, who is white (his grandfather, a metallurgist, came to town from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century and used to scavenge for junk on the beach with a horse-drawn wagon), has noticed an uptick in the number of shopping bags from the outlet mall, a few blocks away. In his opinion, the sixties were worse.<span data-page="page_4"></span> âItâs not that bad here. Yet.â Twenty years ago, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority moved the pawnshop a few blocks, in an effort to remedy the cityâs oft-lamented lack of a supermarket. âBut they opened a discount liquor store next door to the new supermarket,â Wood said. âThat was not a good move. They wound up with winos hanging around. People were scared to go to the supermarket. So it closed up.â</p><p>âAtlantic City turned its back on the boardwalk,â Paul Steelman, a prominent casino architect who grew up nearby, said. âItâs the most prominent pedestrian walkway in the world. Itâs got everything going for it except the buildings that are on it.â His solution: âCut holes in the casinos and let out all those people, all that capital.â</p><p>In order to prevent monopolies, the Casino Control Act stipulated that no one could own more than three casinos. In the eighties, Donald Trump became the first to hit that limit. Eventually, the provision was scrapped, and by 2014 Caesars owned four. Carl Icahn now effectively controls a quarter of the market with just two casinos, the Tropicana and the Taj Mahal.</p><p>Does Atlantic City need more gambling, or less? There are proponents on both sides. Some favor alternative entertainments (concerts, water parks, polo, legalized marijuana) or the panacean potential of higher education (Stockton University, a state college headquartered offshore, has long wanted an Atlantic City campus). A few push for smaller boutique casinos, and others swear by the existing big-box regimen, just done better. In Las Vegas the ratio of revenue is two-thirds non-gaming to one-third gaming. In Atlantic City the situation is reversed. Since 2006, gaming revenue has dropped by half, from a peak of $5.2 billion to $2.7 billion. As that stream dries up, logic suggests tapping others. And yet the casinos remain lucrative. Divided among eight casinosâthatâs how many are leftâ$2.7 billion isnât bad. This may be the localsâ most commonly stated reassurance. The city has a higher concentration of casinos than anywhere outside Nevada. It gets twenty-five million visitors a year.</p><p>I asked Steve Perskie, who wrote the Casino Control Act as a state legislator representing Atlantic City, if casinos, in the final accounting, had been good for the town. âCompared to what?â he replied. âImagine Atlantic City without them.â</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>When word gets out that a city is on the skids, people seem eager to imagine post-apocalyptic desolation, a rusting ruin at Ozymandian remove from the glory days. But American cities donât seem to die that way. They keep sopping up tax dollars and risk capital, thwarting big ideas and emergency relief, chewing up opportunists and champions.</p><p>Two weeks after the shuttering of Revel, Trump Plaza closedâthe fourth casino to do so in 2014. The first was the Atlantic Club, nÃ© the Golden Nugget, built in 1980 by Steve Wynn, with financing by Michael Milken and one of the earliest iterations of the junk bond, and then owned (and rechristened), in succession, by Ballyâs, Hilton, and Resorts International. Two competitors, Tropicana (owned by Icahn) and Caesars (controlled by the private-equity firms Apollo Management and TPG Capital), bought out the bankrupt Atlantic Club, closed it, and divvied up the scraps. Next came the Showboat. It was profitable, but its owner, Caesars, hobbled by debt, needed to consolidate. (The amputation failed: in January, Caesars declared bankruptcy; another of its holdings, the Ballyâs casino, has been rumored to be the next to go.) Meanwhile, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy (its fourth), and Icahn, whoâd bought up Trumpâs debt, played a game of chicken with the casino workersâ union and the state. (Donald Trump himself no longer runs the company or the casinos, and he has sued to have his name removed.) In December, the Trump Taj Mahal was about to close; Icahn, having squeezed the state and the union for concessions on taxes and benefits, found twenty million dollars to keep it open, and since then it has limped along, a zombie casbah.</p><p>Itâs not all the big shotsâ fault. Thereâs just been less money to go around. Atlantic City has lost its monopoly on legalized gambling on the East Coast. First came the casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut, in the nineties, and then, in recent years, the advance of gaming across state lines, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New York. (Some industry experts will tell you that Manhattan is destined to have tables, too.) Now thereâs talk of casinos in North Jersey, which, along with video-slot parlors at the racetracks (âracinosâ), would cannibalize the action in Atlantic City.</p><p>Neighboring states approved legalized gambling in the hope that it would do for their economies and state treasuries what it once did for New Jerseyâs. Perhaps they should hope instead that it does not. The casino closures in Atlantic City have contributed to the loss of nearly ten thousand jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and who knows how many associated income streams, reputable or not. The city has fewer than forty thousand permanent residents; the majority of Atlantic Cityâs workers live offshore, in the townships of Atlantic County, which, in the first quarter of this year, led the nation in foreclosures. Property taxes in the city have doubled since 2008 and were up twenty-nine per cent in 2014, to make up for the drop in tax revenue from the casinos and in the taxable<span data-page="page_5"></span> value of the property. The city is around four hundred million dollars in debt. Earlier this year, its credit rating was downgraded to junk-bond status.</p><p>After convening a few summits on the predicament in Atlantic City, which resulted in a dire report, Governor Christie, in January, appointed two emergency managers, Kevin Lavin and Kevyn Orr, to oversee the cityâs finances, wresting control from the mayor and the city council. The fact that Orr had previously served as Detroitâs emergency manager, steering Detroit into and out of bankruptcy, led observers to predict that heâd been hired to do the same for Atlantic City. Perhaps mercifully, the mayor, Don Guardian, was relieved of some of the hardest decisions, about who and how many to fire and what services to deprive the citizens of. âA good manager welcomes a good auditor,â he told me. The mess was now Christieâs. Presiding over the first bankruptcy for a New Jersey municipality since the Great Depression would not help his Presidential ambitions, and, perhaps more important, it would raise the already high costs of borrowing across a state whose finances are very grim. Christie staked a lot on his rescue of Atlantic City, and so far the betâs not looking so good.</p><p>In May, the city submitted a plan to lay off two hundred city workers, about a fifth of the municipal workforce. Orr returned to private practice, having been paid seventy thousand dollars for three months of part-time work. (Heâd billed the state nine hundred and fifty dollars an hour.)</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Abandonment, and the spectre of bankruptcy, intensified the bleakness of the winter in Atlantic City. At one end of the boardwalk, Revel loomed dark. At night, the blare of piped-in pop warped in the wind, and floodlight spilled out over the dunes, which, post-Sandy, were just a layer of sand atop an armature of giant sandbags. The obituarists who came to gawk didnât have to bother going so far. On the faÃ§ade of the first casino that one saw after pulling off the expressway there was the ghost lettering of the immense sign that once spelled out âTrump Plazaâ and, beneath it, a billboard that read âThe Center of It All.â (The small print read âGambling Problem? Call 1-800-<em class="small">Gambler</em>ââadvice, maybe, for the city itself.) Visitors regularly stopped to photograph this, to add to their portfolio of what some locals, resenting the attention, considered ruin porn.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a19256"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f17206a168e2d17783/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19256.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f17206a168e2d17783/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19256.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f17206a168e2d17783/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19256.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f17206a168e2d17783/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19256.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f17206a168e2d17783/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_a19256.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19256&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19256&amp;text=a19256&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19256" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20a19256&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19256" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>The greatest ruin was to the lives of the thousands whoâd lost their jobs. One morning, I met Dawn Inglin, who had gone to work as a cocktail waitress at the Plaza when it first opened, in 1984. Sheâd come to town three years before, when a friend got her a role in a dinner-theatre company down shore, in Ocean City, and then she found herself auditioning at Harrahâs, which, in those days, used cocktail waitresses as dancers in its TV commercials. âThe choreography was difficult,â she recalled.</p><p>When she applied for a job at the Plaza, she auditioned for Donald Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan. She remembers a weigh-in, and an interview in a bathing suit, and she and the others were required to wear two-and-a-half-inch heels. (When I met her, she had her hair up and was wearing a smart lavender suit.) âI very much enjoyed working for Donald Trump,â Inglin said. âWhen he was there, it was tip-top. Youâdâve thought he was the Messiah.â</p><p>Inglinâs generation of casino workers, whose professional primes track the birth and decline of the industry in Atlantic City, speak wistfully of the abundance and camaraderie of the halcyon days. âBack in the eighties and nineties, the money flowed. It was glamorous,â Inglin said. âThen the attention and the business was diverted from the Plaza to the Taj. Things started closing. Restaurants, room service. For four or five years, there were constant rumors that this or that person was going to buy us. I donât have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who were going to save us. The last few years were so stressful. You watched people lose their jobs. They were taking away severance, the machines disappearing, equipment rolling past you.â</p><p>After thirty years, she was fourth in seniority among cocktail waitresses at the Plaza and was making $8.99 an hour, plus benefits. It ended last September. âWhen we found out we were closing, we were standing at the barâthe last bar in the casino. We saw it on the six-oâclock news. We were frantic.â</p><p>Despite coming up empty in a search for another job, Inglin felt that she was going to be all right. Since the Plaza closed, she has been attending classes at the community college in pursuit of a degree in human servicesâa growth field in these parts. âWe have an addiction problem here,â she said.</p><p>I met a bus driver named Kip Brown, who worked the Port Authority route, up and back each morning, for Academy Bus Lines. He had been at Academy for fifteen years and was No. 3 in seniority, out of seventy drivers in the region. As ridership has fallen, Academy has been cutting back on its schedule. The number of visitors arriving by bus is an eighth of what it was a quarter century ago. In the spring, Brown, just forty-seven, retired.</p><p>Now he was looking for work as a livery driver.<span data-page="page_6"></span> Brown also used to work in the casinos, at the Showboat, bussing tables, and at Trumpâs Castle, stripping and waxing floors. âWhen Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,â he said. âIt was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.â</p><p>He lives in the Northside, on Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard, in a house that, like many in town, was inundated during Hurricane Sandy. âSandy: that was the beginning of the fall of Atlantic City,â he said. Because of the rise in property taxes, the value of the house is well below the value of the mortgage, so he is stuck with it. âIf I could get out of my house, I would. I donât want to live in Atlantic City, to be honest with you.â Recently, one of the employees at his cousinâs corner store had been killed in an armed robbery.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Atlantic City has had three great bosses, political or otherwise. In the decades prior to the First World War, Louis Kuehnle, a transplanted New Yorker and powerful Republican known to all as the Commodore, turned the resort into a bustling metropolis and the state party into a patron and beneficiary of the evolving local aptitude for vice. Enoch (Nucky) Johnson, his successor and the basis for the Steve Buscemi character in âBoardwalk Empire,â continued this work and presided over Atlantic Cityâs glory years, during Prohibition, which, largely thanks to his efforts, never really pertained. The third was Hap Farley, a Republican legislator and master puller of wires, whose political swan song was his support, behind the scenes, for the second (and successful) attempt, in 1976, to pass the state bill to legalize gambling in Atlantic City.</p><p>Since then, there have been party bosses, governors, and mayors with varying degrees of power and venality, but no kingfish of the stature of the Commodore, Nucky, or Hap. âIâll give you Atlantic City,â the mayor of Camden said, to F.B.I. agents disguised as Arabs during the Abscam sting. âWithout me, you do nothing.â But by then such an offer was beyond the reach of any one man. In city politics, the Democrats held sway. (The electorate is now thirty per cent Hispanic and forty per cent black; Democrats outnumber Republicans nine to one.) The only Republican elected to<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/#editorsnote">*</a> City Hall in the casino era was James Usry, the cityâs first black mayor, who got caught up in a corruption investigation that cost him the 1990 electionâuntil 2013, when, to the great surprise of the cityâs political establishment, Don Guardian, a gay white Republican, beat Lorenzo (Rennie) Langford, an African-American, by fewer than four hundred votes.</p><p>Langford, out of the public eye since then, has been writing a memoir and working as a substitute teacher. He lives in the same modest split-level that heâs been in for twenty-eight years (âIn two years itâll be paid forâ), on a street in the Northside that has been renamed L. T. Langford Lane. We talked in his âman lair,â a furnished subfloor with jazz paraphernalia and a wall of fame: his wife, Nynell, with him and Jay Z and BeyoncÃ©; Stevie Wonder; Janet Jackson; Michael Vick; and Lionel Richie. He had on a Champion sweatshirt, jeans, and Nikes. His grandfather had come to town in the twenties, bought some trucks, and won trash-removal contracts at the big hotels. Langfordâs father dropped out of high school and worked in a factory. Langford went to college, then dealer school at the Casino Career Institute, on the Black Horse Pike, one of the old Atlantic City arteries, and started at Caesars when it opened, in 1979. He spent fourteen years in the industryâas a floor supervisor at the Playboy and a pit boss at the Atlantis and the Taj Mahal. In 1992, he ran for city council.</p><p>People dish a lot of dirt about Rennieâhow heâd put his extended family on the payroll; how he had sued the city and, after becoming mayor, got a settlement of more than four hundred thousand dollars (a judge later ordered him to repay it); how his wifeâs goddaughter, the pop singer Ashanti, got paid twenty thousand dollars for spending a day at the Atlantic City high schoolâbut itâs hard, when youâre in his home, hearing his side, not to admire his cheek, in the hurly-burly of Chris Christieâs New Jersey, or not to credit his assessment that in the end what has befallen Atlantic City could not have been prevented by any mere satrap.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a19378"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f38a032b339a0cd51c/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19378.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f38a032b339a0cd51c/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19378.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f38a032b339a0cd51c/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19378.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f38a032b339a0cd51c/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_a19378.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f38a032b339a0cd51c/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_a19378.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âYou canât take a solo after every serve.â</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19378&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19378&amp;text=a19378&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19378" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20a19378&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fa19378" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>âFor the last four years, everything was my fault,â he said. âNo matter how many times I talked about neighboring jurisdictions or the national economy, it was âLangford, itâs your fault.âÂ â As for the Revel project, he says that from the start heâd considered it âextremely riskyâ in a saturated market, and that it got such extravagant support from Christie and the state because it was a way to steer the support of the construction unions to the Governor and his party. Langford said, âWhat Christie thought would be his shining achievement will be the albatross around his neck.â</p><p>His successor, Guardian, is sixty-two and from North Jersey. He is a former Boy Scouts of America executive. (âI couldnât have gotten out at a better time,â he told me;<span data-page="page_7"></span> he left just before the Scoutsâ policy regarding homosexuality became a national controversy.) Guardian made his name, locally, as the head of the cityâs Special Improvement District. He was a keen advocate and errand man for the tourist precincts, the guy out on the boardwalk on his bicycle at dawn, picking up the plastic cups. He was not a part of any machine, but he worked tirelessly to round up votes, and Langford, having survived a bruising, expensive primary and confident of the black vote, apparently got complacent. Guardian also picked up the support of the stateâs Republican establishment and of the unions, in light of his promises to put âcranes in the sky.â</p><p>Guardian has been frank about the cityâs predicament yet optimistic about its prospects. He has a jolly goofball air and a tireless enthusiasm for particulars. He wears bow ties and has trouble pronouncing his ârâs and âlâs. His partner of twenty-one years, Louis Fatato, whom he married last summer, runs a spa at the Borgata. Guardian is routinely unpunctual and speaks off the cuff with enough dash that Chris Filiciello, his chief of staff, usually sticks close to keep watch. At City Hall, a dreary D.M.V.-like cube of concrete and glass, they share an office on the seventh floor, with sweeping views toward Revel and the South Inlet. When I visited, Filiciello looked on coolly from his desk, dipping into a tub of animal crackers, while Guardian enumerated some of the intractable financial problems the city faces. âIf I can take eighty million out of the budget, thatâs sustainable, but thatâs not feasible right now, not if we want to provide public safety and public works. I can get forty out.â</p><p>In public, he projects a no-bullshit boosterism reminiscent of Ed Koch. He was the keynote speaker at this yearâs annual luncheon of the Metropolitan Business and Citizens Association, a kind of super-charged chamber of commerce. The luncheon was at Caesars Palace, on the day, as it happens, that Caesars, the parent company, declared bankruptcy. The Palladium Ballroom was filled with glad-handers, as the casinoâs employeesâemployed for nowâpoker-facedly delivered pats of butter molded into the profile of Augustus.</p><p>âYou think you had a bad day?â Guardian began. âI woke up this morning, Caesars filed bankruptcy, all three elevators are broken in City Hall, and thereâs a major water leak at public works.â He went on, âHey, at least weâre not Detroit!â</p><p>âLast year, I promised you a root canal,â Guardian told the crowd. âI just forgot the Novocain.â But the good news was that âthe root canal is over and the healing is about to begin.â Or, as he said at the end, â2015âs got to be better than 2014. 2014 sucked!â</p><p>The hosts of the luncheon, and the founders of the M.B.C.A., were the local philanthropists Gary Hill and John Schultz. Schultz, an Atlantic City native and three-term city councilman, and Hill, from Reading, Pennsylvania, made their money operating night clubs (Studio Six, Club Tru) in a forlorn stretch of town where the Sands used to be. Eventually, the casinos figured out the night-club business, so Schultz and Hill got out, and started giving their money away. Twenty years ago, they bought an old building near the clubs, next door to a porn shop, and converted the top three floors into a triplex they called Casa Del Cielo, where they live together and preside as ambassadors, of a kind, over various gaudy but charitable entertainments. In a way, they are avatars of the townâs long-dormant gay scene, which has reawakened in recent years.</p><p>The night of the luncheon, they had me up for a drink. Past a suite of paintings by Ringo Starr and a library shelved with scrapbooks chronicling Hill and Schultzâs twenty-seven years together, a loggia led to a heated pool, which they once filled with wine corks. Here and there were garish furnishings salvaged from the casinos: headboards from Trump Plaza, smokestacks and banquettes from the Showboat, chandeliers from the Sands. Last summer, they hosted Mayor Guardianâs wedding; Schultz officiated. The event was catered by Hauke and Tony Boloneyâs.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>It was hard to find a building or enterprise in the city limits that was not in some way touched by crisis and folly. But none was more conspicuous, and of greater likely consequence to the city in the long run, than Revel. Last September, with Glenn Straubâs ninety-million-dollar offer as the stalking horse, the bankruptcy court held an auction to sell it. The winner, at a hundred and ten million dollars, was Brookfield Property Partners, based in Toronto. Brookfield owned the Atlantis in Nassau and the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, and so saw some synergy here, but it couldnât make a deal with the owners of Revelâs adjacent power plant, which had been built solely for Revel and was charging Revel three million dollars a month for utilities. (The power plant was a separate, independently owned entity, called ACR Energy Partnersâan arrangement that has proved poisonous.) In November, Brookfield decided to forfeit its deposit, of eleven million dollars, and walk away. The only bid left, apparently, was the one predicated on a Tower of Geniuses.</p><p>Straub began unfurling his plans. He said heâd spend three hundred million dollars building the second tower and another half billion to buy up derelict property around town. Heâd refurbish Bader Field, the defunct downtown<span data-page="page_8"></span> airport, and establish an equestrian center for two thousand horses, polo fields, high-speed ferries to Manhattan, a life-extension university, and the worldâs biggest indoor water park.</p><p>Whenever I called Straub, he answered his own phone and seemed not to have assistants or gatekeepers, or any kind of filter at all. The first time he picked up, at his club, he told me, through bites of an apple, that he had just finished playing a polo match, that he lived and worked on a yacht, that he was debt-free, and that he had two brilliant adult daughters with whom he had failed to spend enough time. Once, he answered his phone as he was getting fingerprinted by the Casino Control Commission, for his gambling-license application. Another time, he announced that he was at a urinal. With bankruptcy-court procedures in mind, I asked, âSo what comes next?â and he replied, âI wash my hands.â</p><p>Straub invited me to meet him at Revel one day in February, on one of his trips to town. He tended to fly up on Spirit Airways, to save money. When I arrived, he was still busy trying to buy Bader Field. (The city, the Mayor had told me, wanted far more for it than Straub was willing to pay.) Straub also talked of buying the racetrack, Trump Plaza, the Showboat, and several large tracts of undeveloped land in various parts of the city. At times, he talked as though heâd bought some of these things already.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/levin-1998-05-25"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f58a032b339a0cd520/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_levin-1998-05-25.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f58a032b339a0cd520/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_levin-1998-05-25.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f58a032b339a0cd520/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_levin-1998-05-25.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f58a032b339a0cd520/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_levin-1998-05-25.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f58a032b339a0cd520/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_levin-1998-05-25.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âHave ye seen a whale that matches this swatch?â</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Flevin-1998-05-25&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Flevin-1998-05-25&amp;text=levin-1998-05-25&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Flevin-1998-05-25" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20levin-1998-05-25&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Flevin-1998-05-25" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>In the all but abandoned Revel corporate offices, overlooking a slatey winter sea, two of the remaining Revel employees were waiting for Straub to arrive. They didnât work for him yet, but, given that he was the putative buyer, they allowed him to use the space and they were inclined to be deferential.</p><p>âItâs kind of hard to believe Glenn Straub might be our white knight, but here we are,â one said.</p><p>âJust a tip,â the other said. âHe likes to be called Mr. Straub.â</p><p>Straub arrived alone, wearing a zip-up hoodie under a blazer. He had a Florida tan and hair that was brushed back and reddish-brown. Heâs trim, at sixty-eight, and he had the bent gait of an aging country-club athlete. In a kitchenette, he made a sandwich for himself and sat down in a conference room with a view down the boardwalk: in the foreground, the empty lot that would one day, he hoped, be home to his water park, and then, stretching south, the casino cordilleraâShowboat, Taj, Resorts, Ballyâs, Caesars, Trump, Trop.</p><p>âItâll be done the right way,â Straub said. âIâll actually wash the windows here. Itâll cost a couple of dollars. There must be ten million windows in this frigging place. Thatâs the first thing weâll do. Get the laser light shows and wash the windows and hire four thousand employees. That way, Iâll get the politicians. âOh, Straub, I know him. I want to do business with one of his marinas,â or whatever.Â .Â .Â . Get their attention. âGuys, I got a high-speed ferry.Â .Â .Â . Midtown Manhattan, what do you got there for a pier?â Politicians can get you into that place that you canât get into.â</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Straubâs way of talking in a stream-of-consciousness rush, in the manner of an Appalachian Don King, often made his big plans seem scattershot and his tactical explanations disjointed, at least to someone not adept in vulture finance. âHe has a learning disability,â his daughter Kim, a branding consultant in New York, told me. âWhen he was a kid, when it was time to read aloud in class, heâd count the people who were supposed to read before him and then, just before his turn, go to the rest room. Heâs a bit of a savant.â</p><p>Straub comes from Wheeling, West Virginia, where his father had a business providing transportation to the Texas Eastern pipeline and later owned auto-leasing franchises and taxi fleets. âSo you worked, and if you didnât work Dad got the belt out and beat your butt,â Straub said. âAnyway, he died, just when I got my driverâs license.â After high school, Straub and a brother helped run the businesses. In time, they owned a network of sand and gravel quarries and concrete and asphalt plants; highway- and airport-construction contracts made them rich. (In recent years, those long-moribund quarries, in the upper Ohio River Valley, have been found to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas, extractable by horizontal drill, making Straub even richer.)</p><p>Straub retired at forty, moving his family (his wife, from whom he divorced in 2007, and two daughters) to Florida. âI lasted six months,â he said. He started investing in distressed and bankrupt properties. It was a good time to have cash on hand. In the wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, at a Resolution Trust Corporation auction, he bought a twenty-two-hundred-acre golf and polo club in Wellington, for $27.1 million. It was called Palm Beach Polo. âAll of a sudden, people were giving me a half a million dollars for an acre,â he said. âI sold two or three hundred million dollarsâ worth, and we still have another thousand acres down there.â A big driver was the equestrian center: âNever once thought it would turn out to be a gold mine, but it did turn out to be a gold mine, because then<span data-page="page_9"></span> the Bloombergs of the world and their daughters, and all the movie starsâ daughters, they would go down there, and they would have the big Olympic stars do the show jumping, and there was this thing called polo. I didnât know what a polo game looked like. They put you on a horse. And I thought, This isnât that hard. I was good in sports, amateur sports. I can hit things. I can pick a fly out of the air.â</p><p>Straub has been called âthe dictator of Palm Beach polo.â His reign has been contentious. In numerous lawsuits, he has been accused of neglecting his residents, as well as the grounds, and charging undue fees. In 2010, he was tried, and ultimately acquitted, on criminal charges of polluting protected wetlands. He was once convicted of contempt, after interfering with a federal marshal whoâd come to seize a yacht at a marina Straub owned. He tried to appeal the verdict all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. Through the years, he has been proudly litigious. âIf you check me out, Iâm pretty good at protecting our rights in the court system,â Straub told me.</p><p>In the conference room, he told me about his idea for an ocean liner. âAn old ocean liner, like the QE2. Iâm gonna buy it,â he said. He squeezed mayonnaise from a packet. âBring this ocean liner in, and I donât know if youâve been around Ripleyâs down in Orlando, the whole building shaking and everything else. Iâm gonna teach my kids, or my kidsâ kids, what World War II was all about, and the Holocaust, and Zeros coming in from Japan, and so when you go inside this thing, this ship, itâs gonna make you feel like youâre being bombed, like Pearl Harbor when the damned Zeros came in, took out our whole fleet in the Pacific. The shipâs suites where the crew used to be will be for my construction workers, because if weâre gonna spend this kind of money up here I need to get cheap housing for them, so instead of shipping them back to Philadelphia and bringing them here every day Iâll let them store themselves in the bottom of the ship. Itâll be like the back lots at M-G-M.â</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Throughout the winter, Straub made regular trips to Atlantic City and to the federal bankruptcy court in Camden, where he pressed his attempt to have his bid approved. Amid innumerable motions, hearings, and rulings, attorneys representing bank lenders, unsecured creditors, jilted tenants, other prospective buyers, the power company, and the gutted estate argued for and against his offer, sometimes changing sides as the circumstances evolved. Other bidders waded in and wandered off. The power company remained a sticking point. The lawyers racked up their fees and did their pressers on the courthouse steps.</p><p>One cold morning in February, Straub arrived at the courthouse in a gray suit, with a trenchcoat slung over his shoulders. He said heâd left his cell phone in a bathroom at the airport, and someone had retrieved it and was sending it back. He looked at the pairs of lawyers filing in through the door. âA few more guys and weâll get a soccer game going here,â he said. âI wish <em class="">I</em> was getting paid a thousand bucks an hour.â Straubâs lawyer, Stuart Moskovitz, of Freehold, not normally a bankruptcy attorney, called them the âbankruptcy cabal.â It was essentially the deadline on Straubâs bid, now at ninety-five million dollars, but he had failed to close, owing to some unresolved questions about his obligation to old leaseholders and to the power plant.</p><p>âWe need to know what weâre buying,â Moskovitz said.</p><p>Revelâs lawyer told the judge, âWeâre ready to move on to another buyer.â</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/noth-2005-11-07"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f757b86d47b169c72d/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_noth-2005-11-07.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f757b86d47b169c72d/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_noth-2005-11-07.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f757b86d47b169c72d/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_noth-2005-11-07.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f757b86d47b169c72d/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_noth-2005-11-07.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f757b86d47b169c72d/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_noth-2005-11-07.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âCan I get back to you when thereâs someone to overhear me?â</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fnoth-2005-11-07&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fnoth-2005-11-07&amp;text=noth-2005-11-07&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fnoth-2005-11-07" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20noth-2005-11-07&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fnoth-2005-11-07" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>Problem was there didnât seem to be one. With this in mind, Straub and Moskovitz had been threatening to put in a much lower bid if their offer fell through. At one point, Straub stood and handed his lawyer a piece of paper. Moskovitz read aloud, âSometimes the judge has to protect the debtor from himself.â</p><p>In the back of the courtroom, a lanky man in a yellow sweater, his graying hair perfectly in place and his eyes darting around, fidgeted with his fingers as though he were handling invisible chopsticks. His name was Vincent Crandon. He was a low-profile Jersey dealmaker from Mahwah, and he had been circling various properties in Atlantic City for years, to no avail. Heâd failed in attempts to buy Trump Plaza and the Atlantic Club. Early on, heâd been after a bricks-and-mortar property to go with an Internet-gaming company. But his quest had morphed into something else, and so now he just lurked, waiting for the court, or perhaps the entropy of Atlantic City, to scuttle Straubâs bid. Quietly casting himself as the new white knight, heâd submitted an offer, but so far it had gone unacknowledged.</p><p>âStraub is done,â Crandon told me later. âWeâve put in a better offer. Weâre sitting back, taking our time.â He added, âStraub thinks heâs the only guy in town.â</p><p>The town, and the sellers, seemed to think so, too. After the ninety-five-million-dollar offer fell apart, Straub put in a lower bid, for eighty-two million, and lawyers for Revel and the lenders, increasingly desperate, supported it in court. At the beginning of April, the presiding judge,<span data-page="page_10"></span> Gloria Burns, who said she would not let the case delay her impending retirement, abruptly ruled in favor of Straub. The questions of the tenants and power plant remained unresolved. For a few days, anyway, the town experienced something like hope.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Atlantic City, formerly a breeding ground for big ideas, was now a tar pitâtrapping financial mastodons and big-eyed dreamers, whether or not their intentions were pure, as the capricious gods of commerce looked on. Revel kept luring in new ones. In April, the day after Straub took ownership of Revel, he called Crandon andâaccording to Crandon, anyway; Straub denies itâoffered to flip the property to him for a hundred million dollars. A couple of days later, Crandon drove down to Atlantic City. With Revel blacked out (owing to the inevitable dispute between Straub and ACR, the power company), the only people allowed inside were security officers from the Casino Control Commission. They stood in darkness guarding acres of idled slot machines, which Straub wasnât technically authorized to own, since he had no gaming license. So, according to Crandon, the two men who would decide Revelâs fate met in one of its parking garages. Crandon had along one of his partners, Don Marrandino, an Atlantic City native known as Rockinâ Don, for his music-industry connections. He had been the president of Hard Rock in Las Vegas and of Caesars East Coast operations. Straub was accompanied by Tara Lordi, his adviser and âtoxic-asset manager,â a horsewoman and former banker. Crandon says Straub told them he wanted much more than a hundred million for Revel, but at least he now had a possible out, and Crandon had an in. (Straub says the meeting never happened.)</p><p>Crandon had been eying Revel for a year. Crandon, who is fifty-three, grew up in Delaware, but his parents were from New Jersey, and as a kid he worked at a service station his grandfather owned on the Black Horse Pike. His surname used to be Ceccola; Crandon is an adaptation of Cranendonk. His father-in-law is Theodor Cranendonk, a wealthy Dutch oil trader who was once imprisoned in Italy on charges of delivering thirty bazookas to the Mafia. (âIt was all made up,â Crandon says. According to Crandon, Dutch commandoes sprung Cranendonk from a prison hospital and brought him back to the Netherlands.) One of Crandonâs investment vehicles is called MidOil, but Cranendonk was not involved in the Revel bid. âHe doesnât do gambling,â Crandon said.</p><p>Crandon said his groupââWeâre Jersey guysââplanned to spend hundreds of millions reconfiguring the space. The new name would be Rebel. Crandon said they were planning a forty-night Bon Jovi residency. Rockinâ Don had the pull.</p><p>The money wasnât from Jersey guys. Crandon says he spent a marathon weekend in town and in New York wooing representatives from a Chinese real-estate firm that had been buying up properties around the United States. Crandonâs group and the Chinese were betting that Macau, the Asian gambling mecca, was tapped out, amid a Chinese government crackdown on corruption and gambling, and that travellers from mainland China would soon be including South Jersey on their U.S. itineraries. The Atlantic City airport would be the hub for jumbo-jet charters from Asia. The margins are better if you can lure a plane from Hong Kong than a bus from Port Authority. Atlantic City, born in proximity to the population and early industrial wealth of Philadelphia, would now reach halfway around the world for money and the guests from whom to separate it.</p><p>Crandon believed that Straub was planning to demolish Revel. A consultant had told him you could net a hundred million dollars if you sold it off as spare parts. There was a precedent: In 2004, Straub bought Miami Arena for twenty-eight million dollars, half what the city had paid to build it. He promised to turn it into a venue for horse shows, conventions, and minor-league sports, to help revive downtown Miami. âTearing it down serves nobodyâs purpose,â Straub said at the time. Four years later, he tore it down.</p><p>Events on the ground in Atlantic City seemed to be pushing Straub in that direction. As soon as he bought Revel, he found himself, not unexpectedly, in a war with ACR, the power plant, and thus, in short order, with the city. The maneuverings often seemed frivolous and petty, except that a city was at stake. Straub refused to pay ACR the three million a month for power, and ACR refused to provide it for free. And so Revel remained dark: no light, heat, air, or water, no sprinklers or alarms. The cityâs fire marshal deemed the building unsafe, and the city rescinded Straubâs certificate of occupancy and began fining him five thousand dollars a day. Observers wondered about catastrophic fire and debilitating mold.</p><p>Straub dug in. He told reporters, as he unsuccessfully challenged the plantâs owners in court, âWeâll erase them off the map.â He brought in a fleet of diesel generators and parked them outside the casino. But he had no permits, and ACR owned much of the connecting infrastructure. Back to court they went. Straub, the loser again, sent the generators away. He told me, referring to city and state officials, âIf they wonât work with me, Iâll just go back to Miami.â Publicly, he made the threat explicit: âIâll tear the building down.â</p><p>To circumvent ACR, Straub had set about trying<span data-page="page_11"></span> to buy the empty casino next door, the Showboat, and tap into its power plant instead. The Showboatâs owner, at the moment, was Stockton University, the state college, which, a few months earlier, had bought it to establish a long-desired Atlantic City campus. The university had paid just ten dollars a square foot. âYou canât even buy tile at Home Depot for ten dollars a square foot!â Herman Saatkamp, Stocktonâs president, told me.</p><div class="Callout__inset-left___2rZjf" data-callout="inset-left" data-type="callout"><div class="CartoonEmbed__container___vf5AM"><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__captionLink___14pNW" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/schwartz-2011-12-12"><figure class="Figure__figure___U_9Te"><div class="placeholder"><div class="placeholder-buttress"></div><div class="placeholder-content"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f87206a168e2d1778b/master/w_280, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_schwartz-2011-12-12.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f87206a168e2d1778b/master/w_560, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_schwartz-2011-12-12.jpg 2x"/><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f87206a168e2d1778b/master/w_727, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_schwartz-2011-12-12.jpg, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f87206a168e2d1778b/master/w_1454, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/150907_schwartz-2011-12-12.jpg 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/593b63f87206a168e2d1778b/master/w_727,c_limit/150907_schwartz-2011-12-12.jpg" title=""/></picture></div></div></div><figcaption class="ImageCaption__captionWrapper___2h5XI Figure__cartoonCaptionWrapper___1tdkA ImageCaption__default___3TPB5"><span class="ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO ImageCaption__caption___1EOQO">âSeltzerÂ .Â .Â .Â seltzer!â</span></figcaption></figure></a><div class="CartoonEmbed__socialWrapper___3-ICo"><div class="SocialShare__socialShare___92Ene SocialShare__grey___dItUm CartoonEmbed__socialShare___13L3P"><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__facebook___Jm71k" data-source="facebook" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fschwartz-2011-12-12&amp;display=popup&amp;ref=plugin" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__twitter___3O6QA" data-source="twitter" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fschwartz-2011-12-12&amp;text=schwartz-2011-12-12&amp;tw_p=tweetbutton&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fschwartz-2011-12-12" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao SocialShare__link___Sad7k SocialShare__email___TlCif" data-source="email" data-track-location="cartoon" data-track-type="socialShare" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/mailto:/?subject=From%20newyorker.com:%20schwartz-2011-12-12&amp;body=%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fcartoon%2Fschwartz-2011-12-12" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a class="Link__link___3dWao CartoonEmbed__shop___1TDi0" data-track-location="cartoon-shop" data-track-type="shop" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/https://condenaststore.com/conde-nast-brand/cartoonbank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div></div></div><p>But the campus plan had suddenly fallen apart, when Trump Entertainment, owners of the Taj Mahal, next door, unexpectedly opted to enforce an old covenant mandating that the Showboat be a casino-hotel, and nothing else. Icahn, who controls Trump, didnât want a college campus next door. âWho is this guy?â Bob McDevitt, the president of Local 54, the casino workersâ union, said of Icahn, with whom he has been feuding for a year. âHow does he get to decide everything? Heâs disembowelling the city.â</p><p>Icahn blames the unions. âI saved the Tropicana, which was bankrupt, and made it into one of the only vibrant and surviving casinos in Atlantic City,â he told me. âI have also saved the Taj Mahal and have saved six thousand jobs. Bob McDevitt has caused three casinos to close and the loss of thousands of jobs. Ask yourself: Who is the villain of this story?â Capital or labor? Germany or Greece? Depends on whom you talk to. In July, Taj workers, having lost many of their benefits, voted to authorize a strike.</p><p>At any rate, now Stockton was stuck with a vacated casino on its balance sheet and monthly maintenance costs of four hundred thousand dollars. Thatâll buy you a lot of tile. And so Saatkamp, the universityâs president, who is also a leading scholar of George Santayana (âThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat itâ), rushed into a provisional agreement to flip the Showboat to Straub. At the end of April, Saatkamp, out of his depth in these sharky waters, resigned as Stocktonâs president, his tenure scuttled by the Showboat and Revel mess. Santayana: âSkepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it is shameful to surrender it too soon.â</p><p>Throughout the spring, Crandon pressed for a deal while Straub held out for more. Straub told me, âEveryone says, âOh, youâre so fucking smart, Mr. Straub.â And Iâm saying, âIâm not smart. I can just outlast everybody.âÂ â Tara Lordi e-mailed Crandon one afternoon in early April:</p><blockquote><p>Can you kindly by the place so I can get back to the warm weather Iâm freezing my ass off here.</p></blockquote><p>In early May, according to Crandon, the two men met aboard Straubâs yacht, the Triumphant Lady, which heâd brought north to Atlantic City and docked at the Golden Nugget. Crandon says they actually shook on a deal, for a hundred and thirty-two million dollars. (Straub denies this meeting took place and in general was dismissive when I asked him about Crandon, referring to him as âKramden.â)</p><p>But they continued to haggle over terms and timing as Crandon worked out his arrangement with the Chinese. There were stories of Straub stiffing a local law firm, and of his filling a truck with Revel fixtures and tools, bound for Florida. (He denies wrongdoing in both cases.) His deal to buy the Showboat foundered, and a court gave Stockton the go-ahead to seek another buyer. As weeks passed, Crandon made promises that heâd soon hold the keys to Revel, and then the deal would recede again: Zenoâs paradox down the shore.</p><p>At the end of June, Crandon texted me to say that his deal with Straub was off. âGreed and evil have destroyed A.C.â He explained, âWhat happened is we got circumvented.â Straub, apparently, had cut him out of the loop and gone directly to the Chinese. He had come to see the potential of junkets from overseas. Crandon sent photos of Tara Lordi in Shanghai with a Chinese man, whom he still, vestigially, called âmy partnerâ: â2 days after that photo, Chinese canceled our deal.â Crandon vowed revenge: âWe will keep it in litigation for years. No one will get Revel.â</p><p>If Straub was really planning to sell to the Chinese, he wasnât saying. Lordi says she went to Shanghai to play polo. Straub said he was looking for groups to help manage the hotel and the casino. All the while, Revel remained closed. Still no light shows or clean windows, to say nothing of the four thousand new jobs the city so desperately needed. Revelâs remaining employees were let go. There was no one left, really, except for the security guards overlooking the slots, in the sweltering heat of an un-air-conditioned glass box in high summer.</p><p>âNo word on Revel, Showboat, or any of these things,â Mike Hauke said, down at Tony Boloneyâs. âItâs frustrating.â Weekends were busy, weekdays were soft. It was hard to make decisions or plans. âSometimes, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, you drive around town and see four or five cars.â The talk at the shop was mostly about water parks, or the recent news about the mysterious disappearance of three million dollars, which the Langford administration had given to a Bronx businessman in 2013, for a community-loan program that seems to have never made a loan.Â â¦</p><p><a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/#correctionasterisk">*</a>An earlier version of this article stated, incorrectly, that James Usry was the only Republican to<span data-page="page_final"></span> serve as mayor in Atlantic Cityâs casino era.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><span class="ArticleDisclaimer__articleDisclaimer___2kCNX">Published in the print edition of the <a href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07">September 7, 2015</a>, issue.</span><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/nick-paumgarten"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcset="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7b019dfc3494ea36e1/1:1/w_130, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/paumgarten-nick.png, http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7b019dfc3494ea36e1/1:1/w_260, /web/20191222153447im_/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/c_limit/paumgarten-nick.png 2x"/><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447im_/https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b7b019dfc3494ea36e1/1:1/w_130,c_limit/paumgarten-nick.png" title=""/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">Nick Paumgarten has been a staff writer at <em>The New Yorker</em> since 2005.</p><a class="Link__link___3dWao ArticleContributors__contributorBioLink___3ifgZ" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/nick-paumgarten">Read more Â»</a></li></ul></div></div><ul class="Tags__tags___1WDCj"><span class="Tags__heading___3sE5b">More:</span><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/governor-chris-christie">(Governor) Chris Christie</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/atlantic-city">Atlantic City</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bankruptcy">Bankruptcy</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/casinos">Casinos</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/hotels">Hotels</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/morgan-stanley">Morgan Stanley</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/new-jersey">New Jersey</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/news">News</a></li><li class="Tags__item___3xh9I"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="/web/20191222153447/https://www.newyorker.com/tag/real-estate">Real Estate</a></li></ul><div data-cm-unit="show-failsafe"><div class="ArticleFooter__adEndArticle___2_iy_" data-cns="cns-slot-end-of-article"></div></div><div class=""><form><section class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterComponent___1ZI2a"><p class="NewsletterSubscribe__newsletterDek___29WDu">Never miss a big <i>New Yorker</i> story again.

a pizza and sub shop in Atlantic City in 2009, but only after he had failed in nine tries to rent the space to somebody else. He had bought the building three years earlier on the advice of his father, an accountant who considered distressed real estate a smart long-term bet. This piece of real estate seemed to test the proposition. It was a bedraggled three-story clapboard house that years of neighborhood demolition and neglect had stranded at the edge of several mostly vacant blocks, which together formed an urban badlands reaching all the way to the dunes. This was the South Inlet, a once thriving part of town and now more or less a desolate slum at the northeastern end of Absecon Island, the landmass that is home to Atlantic City and three other municipalities. People from âoffshore,â as locals like to call the mainland, tend to think of the islandâs Inlet end as north, because itâs upcoast, but locals call it east. Atlantic City has a Bermuda Triangle effect; it can confound a compass."],["p","Three blocks west of Haukeâs place, an immense slab of steel and glass was rising over the badlands: a hotel and casino to be called Revel, destined to be bigger and more opulent than anything Atlantic City had ever seenâtwo towers, reaching almost fifty stories, nearly four thousand rooms, and parking for more than seven thousand cars. Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, had bought the land in 2006, for seventy million dollars, and sunk about $1.2 billion into the project. (Revel, as some have noted, is âleverâ spelled backward.) By the end, the cost of building Revel reached more than $2.4 billion, making it the most expensive private construction project in the history of New Jersey."],["p","Hauke went after the crumbs. Unable to find a commercial tenant for his houseâs ground floor (the apartments upstairs were designated Section 8, for low-income tenants), he started selling rudimentary takeout to Revelâs construction crews. Their rush-hour bulk orders overwhelmed his staff, but off hours the place was dead: a trickle of casino workers and, in Haukeâs words, âshitbags, crackheads, hustlers, and pimps.â"],["p","Hauke, a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, had spent a couple of years in Hoboken and Manhattan working in marketing, but he had no restaurant experience. One of his first customers was a neighborhood junkie known as V8 Man (âAll the white kids are junkies,â Hauke said. âThe Inlet does it to everybodyâ), who, on opening night, picked a fight at the counter with a male prostitute and another customer; Hauke smashed a pizza paddle on the counter and used the sharp end to scare him off. More than once, a guy came in trying to unload stolen merchandise as the victimized storekeeper came running up the street in pursuit. One morning, a neighborhood kid rode by on a bicycle and threw a crude pipe bomb through the window; Hauke chased him in his car and, after cornering him briefly in an abandoned house, hounded him on foot across a vacant tract called Paulineâs Prairie, named after Pauline Hill, a city planner in the sixties whoâd had this stretch of the neighborhood bulldozed for urban renewal, which never came. The kid, looking over his shoulder, ran into the side of a parked box truck. The police appeared and put him in cuffs. His grievance was that cops had been patronizing Haukeâs shop and that sheriffs had evicted his cousins, Haukeâs Section 8 tenants, from one of the apartments upstairs. The tenants, according to Hauke, had been running a welfare scam. Theyâd also been throwing dirty diapers on his customers and fishing for pigeons from the roof."],["p","Hauke hoped that, in spite of such annoyances, Revel would either provide him with an income stream or else buy him out. A few neighborhood property owners said that it would never happen. Theyâd been holding on for years themselves, in the hope of selling to a big casino, and in the interim theyâd been gutted by rising property taxes and ongoing decay. The problem was that the area was zoned for big casino-hotels. You couldnât build a house, and the few houses left in the neighborhoodâmost had been demolished or had burned down, accidentally or notâwere old and badly battered by the salt air. One of them, down near the beach, across the street from a run-down low-income housing complex called the Waterside, belonged to a teacher Hauke had got to know named Tony Zarych, whoâd moved to Atlantic City as a teen-ager forty years earlier, when his family was buying up property around town. Heâd worked as a baccarat dealer at the Sands, until it closed (it was demolished in 2007), and now taught English as a second language at an elementary school. He liked to hunt wild turkey offshore and sometimes had carcasses hanging outside. His property taxes had risen sharply, as the city contended with a steep drop in tax revenues from the casinos. âGet out while you can,â Zarych told Hauke."],["p","Sure enough, in 2009, amid the financial meltdown, Revel, only half built, ran out of money. In April, 2010, Morgan Stanley quit the project, booking a loss of almost a billion dollars. Construction stopped. Haukeâs business withered. âThere were no more tourists or construction workers,â he recalled. âMostly just cops. And crackheads wanting free shit.â But",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%222%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," something about the city, and about the Inletâs seaside squalor, made him want to stay on. Maybe it was the fact that his great-grandmother had attended shul in the Inlet. Or that heâd simply got sand in his shoes, as the locals say about those who take to the place."],["p","After grinding along for another year, Hauke shut down the shop, spiffed it up, and rechristened it Tony Boloneyâs. He bought a food truck, which he named the Mustache Mobile, and developed a line of pizzas and novelty subs that he marketed as âindigenous Atlantic City grub,â as though heâd revived an obscure provincial cuisine. Soon, Tony Boloneyâs began winning foodie awards and luring in not just gamblers, night-clubbers, food-truck connoisseurs, politicians, and cops but also a procession of casino magnates and real-estate speculators who were visiting the neighborhood, often on the sly, to size up the distressed property next

(She also took over the Presidential Suite, relegating Michelle Obama and her daughters to another suite.) The plan had been scaled backâjust fourteen hundred rooms, and one tower instead of two. The towerâs midsection had a half-dozen stories not yet built out; you could see clear through it. Still, it was an impressive building, with sleek, airy marbled atriums and lobbies that had little in common with the smoky, windowless, carpeted caverns of the older mega-casinos down the boardwalk. Unlike all the rest, it directed oneâs attention to the ocean and had ample outdoor space, a two-acre terrace with firepits and cabanas. Even from the outside, Revel had an ethereal appeal. The reflective glass took on the skyâs hue and became almost invisible at dusk, a stealth casino guarding the edge of town."],["p","If only. During construction, a tower crane collapsed. Lightning struck a workerâs cement bucket and killed him. Three top Revel executives died in a plane crash. A guest plunged from one of several escalators that climbed vertiginously through the heart of the lobby. A couple were found dead of an apparent drug overdose in a suite. The N.F.L. player Ray Rice punched out his fiancÃ©e in an elevator, and the surveillance video went viral."],["p","The casino wasnât making nearly as much money as the developers had anticipated. Some observers blamed the layoutâthe hotel-room elevators didnât access the casino floor, and a long, tortuous trip from the entrance to the check-in desk didnât take you through it, eitherâor the fact that Revel prohibited smoking, or that its slot machines didnât seem to pay out, or that it was stingy with the comps. Even though occupancy was decent and the night clubs and restaurants were busy, the tables and slots werenât taking in enough to offset the cost of operating the placeâthe burden of debt service, high property taxes, bad leases with the tenants, and an expensive arrangement for power and light. Within a year of opening, Revel filed for bankruptcy. It restructured and emerged from Chapter 11 a few months later, but the economics still didnât make sense, and so, in the spring of 2014, it went bankrupt once again. Finally, last September, unable to find a buyer, it closed."],["p","From the time Morgan Stanley began searching in vain for equity partners, Revel had been in play, and all along Tony Boloneyâs had served as an informal commissary for would-be investors and buyers. Among those whom Hauke and his staff said theyâd seen were Steve Wynn, who had sold the Golden Nugget in 1987 and vowed never to come back; various hedge-funders from New York; and a group of Chinese menâthe Export-Import Bank of China was at one point in talks to buy a pieceâwho took over Haukeâs tables and held meetings for hours, without ordering anything."],["p","A mysterious character in tattered clothing and a handlebar mustache had been showing up a few times a year, engaging the staff in conversation about space travel and Elon Musk. He claimed to represent someone who was going to buy Revel. Hauke and his team were skeptical, but one day last summer, just before the casino closed, the man rolled up in a baby-blue Bentley convertible. Maybe he was for real. âMy guyâs going to offer ninety million,â he said.

Within weeks, news broke that a little-known Florida developer named Glenn Straub, the owner of Palm Beach Polo Golf and Country Club, had offered ninety million dollars to buy Revel. Straub wanted to put up the aborted second tower and fill it with academics and scientists charged with solving the worldâs problems: your Tower of Geniuses. Few in town took this seriously, but, as far as the bankruptcy was concerned, heâd established a baseline. Everything has a clearing price. The bad news was that Straubâs offer was less than four cents on the dollarâa chilling signal of how far Atlantic City had fallen and may yet fall.

cities exist as a consequence of commercial or strategic utility. Atlantic City is more of a proposition and a ploy. The town fathers of Cape May, the first American seaside resort, werenât interested in a railway, or perhaps the class of people whoâd ride in on oneâthe well-to-do arrived from Philadelphia by boatâso a group of investors built, in 1854, what became known as a ârailroad to nowhere,â to a spot a little way up the coast that was more or less the shortest possible distance from Philadelphia to the sea. Over the decades, and with the industrial-era advent of leisure time and disposable income, this forsaken wedge of salt marsh and sand became âthe worldâs playgroundââa crucible of conspicuous consumption and a stage for the aspirations and masquerades of visitors and entrepreneurs. In some respects, Atlantic City was where America learned how to turn idle entertainment into big business. For a while, it was home to some of the worldâs grandest hotels (the Marlborough-Blenheim was the largest reinforced-concrete building in the world, and was later imploded in the music video for Bruce Springsteenâs âAtlantic Cityâ), as well as some of its more ardent iniquities and diversions. The night clubs were as often as not fronts for backroom gambling halls, intermittently tolerated by the authorities."],["p","The city, like so many, has its racial demons. At the turn of the twentieth century, Atlantic City had one of the highest African-American populations of any city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, owing to the abundance of jobs in the hotels. The archetypal amusement was that of white working-class visitors kicking back in the boardwalkâs famous wicker rolling chairs while black people did the pushingâa âpublic performance of racial dominance,â notes the historian Bryant Simon, in âBoardwalk of Dreams.â Though the Northside, traditionally a black neighborhood, had been a thriving district, the decline in tourism to the city, after the Second World War, hit it hard. With the rise of affordable air travel, people started going to Florida and the Caribbean instead. The city desegregated. Disneyland opened."],["p","Legalized gambling was supposed to rescue the city from its obsolescence as a resort and convention town, a condition that came to national attention during the 1964 Democratic Convention there and grew more conspicuous as the decade wore on. A dozen years later, the state passed the Casino Control Act, which was, at least ostensibly, an attempt to reverse the decline. But, perhaps predictably, a lot of the money that flowed in flowed right back outâto the casino operators and their financing schemes (âI made a lot of money in Atlantic City,â Donald Trump said at the recent Republican debate. âAnd Iâm very proud of itâ) and to their subsequent efforts to lobby for the approval of casino gambling in other states. New Jersey, which taxes the casinos to fund a seniorsâ prescription-drug program, among other things, always got its piece."],["p","Neglect of the city has been attributed to a bloated municipal payrollâa budget nearly double what it was ten years agoâand the years of corruption and mismanagement in city government. Some blame the suffocating effect of the casinos, which are boxed off from the city and are designed to keep patrons inside losing money rather than outside spending it.

dividing line between south and north, and between white and black, used to be Atlantic Avenue, the main commercial street, which runs parallel to the sea. It was where South Jersey shopped for wedding dresses and jewelry; now itâs a gantlet of shabby storefronts and fast-food joints, running toward and away from the New Jersey Transit bus terminal. In the streets that run from the boardwalk, dilapidation and squalor are not hard to find. Woodâs Loan Office, a pawnshop established in 1927, is owned and operated by Martin Wood, a seventy-nine-year-old Atlantic City native. Wood, who is white (his grandfather, a metallurgist, came to town from Lithuania at the end of the nineteenth century and used to scavenge for junk on the beach with a horse-drawn wagon), has noticed an uptick in the number of shopping bags from the outlet mall, a few blocks away.

They wound up with winos hanging around. People were scared to go to the supermarket. So it closed up.â"],["p","âAtlantic City turned its back on the boardwalk,â Paul Steelman, a prominent casino architect who grew up nearby, said. âItâs the most prominent pedestrian walkway in the world. Itâs got everything going for it except the buildings that are on it.â His solution: âCut holes in the casinos and let out all those people, all that capital.â"],["p","In order to prevent monopolies, the Casino Control Act stipulated that no one could own more than three casinos. In the eighties, Donald Trump became the first to hit that limit. Eventually, the provision was scrapped, and by 2014 Caesars owned four. Carl Icahn now effectively controls a quarter of the market with just two casinos, the Tropicana and the Taj Mahal."],["p","Does Atlantic City need more gambling, or less? There are proponents on both sides. Some favor alternative entertainments (concerts, water parks, polo, legalized marijuana) or the panacean potential of higher education (Stockton University, a state college headquartered offshore, has long wanted an Atlantic City campus). A few push for smaller boutique casinos, and others swear by the existing big-box regimen, just done better. In Las Vegas the ratio of revenue is two-thirds non-gaming to one-third gaming. In Atlantic City the situation is reversed. Since 2006, gaming revenue has dropped by half, from a peak of $5.2 billion to $2.7 billion. As that stream dries up, logic suggests tapping others. And yet the casinos remain lucrative. Divided among eight casinosâthatâs how many are leftâ$2.7 billion isnât bad. This may be the localsâ most commonly stated reassurance. The city has a higher concentration of casinos than anywhere outside Nevada. It gets twenty-five million visitors a year."],["p","I asked Steve Perskie, who wrote the Casino Control Act as a state legislator representing Atlantic City, if casinos, in the final accounting, had

word gets out that a city is on the skids, people seem eager to imagine post-apocalyptic desolation, a rusting ruin at Ozymandian remove from the glory days. But American cities donât seem to die that way. They keep sopping up tax dollars and risk capital, thwarting big ideas and emergency relief, chewing up opportunists and champions."],["p","Two weeks after the shuttering of Revel, Trump Plaza closedâthe fourth casino to do so in 2014. The first was the Atlantic Club, nÃ© the Golden Nugget, built in 1980 by Steve Wynn, with financing by Michael Milken and one of the earliest iterations of the junk bond, and then owned (and rechristened), in succession, by Ballyâs, Hilton, and Resorts International. Two competitors, Tropicana (owned by Icahn) and Caesars (controlled by the private-equity firms Apollo Management and TPG Capital), bought out the bankrupt Atlantic Club, closed it, and divvied up the scraps. Next came the Showboat. It was profitable, but its owner, Caesars, hobbled by debt, needed to consolidate. (The amputation failed: in January, Caesars declared bankruptcy; another of its holdings, the Ballyâs casino, has been rumored to be the next to go.) Meanwhile, Trump Entertainment Resorts declared bankruptcy (its fourth), and Icahn, whoâd bought up Trumpâs debt, played a game of chicken with the casino workersâ union and the state. (Donald Trump himself no longer runs the company or the casinos, and he has sued to have his name removed.) In December, the Trump Taj Mahal was about to close; Icahn, having squeezed the state and the union for concessions on taxes and benefits, found twenty million dollars to keep it open, and since then it has limped along, a zombie casbah."],["p","Itâs not all the big shotsâ fault. Thereâs just been less money to go around. Atlantic City has lost its monopoly on legalized gambling on the East Coast. First came the casinos on Indian reservations in Connecticut, in the nineties, and then, in recent years, the advance of gaming across state lines, in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and upstate New York. (Some industry experts will tell you that Manhattan is destined to have tables, too.) Now thereâs talk of casinos in North Jersey, which, along with video-slot parlors at the racetracks (âracinosâ), would cannibalize the action in Atlantic City."],["p","Neighboring states approved legalized gambling in the hope that it would do for their economies and state treasuries what it once did for New Jerseyâs. Perhaps they should hope instead that it does not. The casino closures in Atlantic City have contributed to the loss of nearly ten thousand jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and who knows how many associated income streams, reputable or not. The city has fewer than forty thousand permanent residents; the majority of Atlantic Cityâs workers live offshore, in the townships of Atlantic County, which, in the first quarter of this year, led the nation in foreclosures. Property taxes in the city have doubled since 2008 and were up twenty-nine per cent in 2014, to make up for the drop in tax revenue from the casinos and in the taxable",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%225%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," value of the property.

The fact that Orr had previously served as Detroitâs emergency manager, steering Detroit into and out of bankruptcy, led observers to predict that heâd been hired to do the same for Atlantic City. Perhaps mercifully, the mayor, Don Guardian, was relieved of some of the hardest decisions, about who and how many to fire and what services to deprive the citizens of. âA good manager welcomes a good auditor,â he told me. The mess was now Christieâs. Presiding over the first bankruptcy for a New Jersey municipality since the Great Depression would not help his Presidential ambitions, and, perhaps more important, it would raise the already high costs of borrowing across a state whose finances are very grim. Christie staked a lot on his rescue of Atlantic City, and so far the betâs not looking so good."],["p","In May, the city submitted a plan to lay off two hundred city workers, about a fifth of the municipal workforce.

Sheâd come to town three years before, when a friend got her a role in a dinner-theatre company down shore, in Ocean City, and then she found herself auditioning at Harrahâs, which, in those days, used cocktail waitresses as dancers in its TV commercials. âThe choreography was difficult,â she recalled."],["p","When she applied for a job at the Plaza, she auditioned for Donald Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan.

For four or five years, there were constant rumors that this or that person was going to buy us. I donât have enough fingers and toes to count the number of people who were going to save us.

City has had three great bosses, political or otherwise.

Enoch (Nucky) Johnson, his successor and the basis for the Steve Buscemi character in âBoardwalk Empire,â continued this work and presided over Atlantic Cityâs glory years, during Prohibition, which, largely thanks to his efforts, never really pertained.

Guardian is routinely unpunctual and speaks off the cuff with enough dash that Chris Filiciello, his chief of staff, usually sticks close to keep watch. At City Hall, a dreary D.M.V.-like cube of concrete and glass, they share an office on the seventh floor, with sweeping views toward Revel and the South Inlet. When I visited, Filiciello looked on coolly from his desk, dipping into a tub of animal crackers, while Guardian enumerated some of the intractable financial problems the city faces. âIf I can take eighty million out of the budget, thatâs sustainable, but thatâs not feasible right now, not if we want to provide public safety and public works.

The Palladium Ballroom was filled with glad-handers, as the casinoâs employeesâemployed for nowâpoker-facedly delivered pats of butter molded into the profile of Augustus."],["p","âYou think you had a bad day?â Guardian began. âI woke up this morning, Caesars filed bankruptcy, all three elevators are broken in City Hall, and thereâs a major water leak at public works.â He went on, âHey, at least weâre not Detroit!â"],["p","âLast year, I promised you a root canal,â Guardian told the crowd. âI just forgot the Novocain.â But the good news was that âthe root canal is over and the healing is about to begin.â Or, as he said at the end, â2015âs got to be better than 2014. 2014 sucked!â"],["p","The hosts of the luncheon, and the founders of the M.B.C.A., were the local philanthropists Gary Hill and John Schultz. Schultz, an Atlantic City native and three-term city councilman, and Hill, from Reading, Pennsylvania, made their money operating night clubs (Studio Six, Club Tru) in a forlorn stretch of town where the Sands used to be. Eventually, the casinos figured out the night-club business, so Schultz and Hill got out, and started giving their money away. Twenty years ago, they bought an old building near the clubs, next door to a porn shop, and converted the top three floors into a triplex they called Casa Del Cielo, where they live together and preside as ambassadors, of a kind, over various gaudy but charitable entertainments. In a way, they are avatars of the townâs long-dormant gay scene, which has reawakened in recent years."],["p","The night of the luncheon, they had me up for a drink. Past a suite of paintings by Ringo Starr and a library shelved with scrapbooks chronicling Hill and Schultzâs twenty-seven years together, a loggia led to a heated pool, which they once filled with wine corks. Here and there were garish furnishings salvaged from the casinos: headboards from Trump Plaza, smokestacks and banquettes from the Showboat, chandeliers from the Sands. Last summer, they hosted Mayor Guardianâs wedding; Schultz officiated. The event was catered by Hauke and Tony Boloneyâs."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EIt%20was%20hard%20to%20find%20a%20building%20or%20enterprise%20in%20the%20city%20limits%20that%20was%20not%20in%20some%20way%20touched%20by%20crisis%20and%20folly.%20But%20none%20was%20more%20conspicuous%2C%20and%20of%20greater%20likely%20consequence%20to%20the%20city%20in%20the%20long%20run%2C%20than%20Revel.%20Last%20September%2C%20with%20Glenn%20Straub%E2%80%99s%20ninety-million-dollar%20offer%20as%20the%20stalking%20horse%2C%20the%20bankruptcy%20court%20held%20an%20auction%20to%20sell%20it.%20The%20winner%2C%20at%20a%20hundred%20and%20ten%20million%20dollars%2C%20was%20Brookfield%20Property%20Partners%2C%20based%20in%20Toronto.%20Brookfield%20owned%20the%20Atlantis%20in%20Nassau%20and%20the%20Hard%20Rock%20in%20Las%20Vegas%2C%20and%20so%20saw%20some%20synergy%20here%2C%20but%20it%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20make%20a%20deal%20with%20the%20owners%20of%20Revel%E2%80%99s%20adjacent%20power%20plant%2C%20which%20had%20been%20built%20solely%20for%20Revel%20and%20was%20charging%20Revel%20three%20million%20dollars%20a%20month%20for%20utilities.%20(The%20power%20plant%20was%20a%20separate%2C%20independently%20owned%20entity%2C%20called%20ACR%20Energy%20Partners%E2%80%94an%20arrangement%20that%20has%20proved%20poisonous.)%20In%20November%2C%20Brookfield%20decided%20to%20forfeit%20its%20deposit%2C%20of%20eleven%20million%20dollars%2C%20and%20walk%20away.%20The%20only%20bid%20left%2C%20apparently%2C%20was%20the%20one%20predicated%20on%20a%20Tower%20of%20Geniuses.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EStraub%20began%20unfurling%20his%20plans.%20He%20said%20he%E2%80%99d%20spend%20three%20hundred%20million%20dollars%20building%20the%20second%20tower%20and%20another%20half%20billion%20to%20buy%20up%20derelict%20property%20around%20town.%20He%E2%80%99d%20refurbish%20Bader%20Field%2C%20the%20defunct%20downtown%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22analytics%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522analytics%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%25228%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%20airport%2C%20and%20establish%20an%20equestrian%20center%20for%20two%20thousand%20horses%2C%20polo%20fields%2C%20high-speed%20ferries%20to%20Manhattan%2C%20a%20life-extension%20university%2C%20and%20the%20world%E2%80%99s%20biggest%20indoor%20water%20park.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhenever%20I%20called%20Straub%2C%20he%20answered%20his%20own%20phone%20and%20seemed%20not%20to%20have%20assistants%20or%20gatekeepers%2C%20or%20any%20kind%20of%20filter%20at%20all.%20The%20first%20time%20he%20picked%20up%2C%20at%20his%20club%2C%20he%20told%20me%2C%20through%20bites%20of%20an%20apple%2C%20that%20he%20had%20just%20finished%20playing%20a%20polo%20match%2C%20that%20he%20lived%20and%20worked%20on%20a%20yacht%2C%20that%20he%20was%20debt-free%2C%20and%20that%20he%20had%20two%20brilliant%20adult%20daughters%20with%20whom%20he%20had%20failed%20to%20spend%20enough%20time.%20Once%2C%20he%20answered%20his%20phone%20as%20he%20was%20getting%20fingerprinted%20by%20the%20Casino%20Control%20Commission%2C%20for%20his%20gambling-license%20application.%20Another%20time%2C%20he%20announced%20that%20he%20was%20at%20a%20urinal.%20With%20bankruptcy-court%20procedures%20in%20mind%2C%20I%20asked%2C%20%E2%80%9CSo%20what%20comes%20next%3F%E2%80%9D%20and%20he%20replied%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20wash%20my%20hands.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EStraub%20invited%20me%20to%20meet%20him%20at%20Revel%20one%20day%20in%20February%2C%20on%20one%20of%20his%20trips%20to%20town.%20He%20tended%20to%20fly%20up%20on%20Spirit%20Airways%2C%20to%20save%20money.%20When%20I%20arrived%2C%20he%20was%20still%20busy%20trying%20to%20buy%20Bader%20Field.%20(The%20city%2C%20the%20Mayor%20had%20told%20me%2C%20wanted%20far%20more%20for%20it%20than%20Straub%20was%20willing%20to%20pay.)%20Straub%20also%20talked%20of%20buying%20the%20racetrack%2C%20Trump%20Plaza%2C%20the%20Showboat%2C%20and%20several%20large%20tracts%20of%20undeveloped%20land%20in%20various%20parts%20of%20the%20city.%20At%20times%2C%20he%20talked%20as%20though%20he%E2%80%99d%20bought%20some%20of%20these%20things%20already.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoons%25252F593b63f58a032b339a0cd520%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%2522593b63f58a032b339a0cd520%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%

Last September, with Glenn Straubâs ninety-million-dollar offer as the stalking horse, the bankruptcy court held an auction to sell it. The winner, at a hundred and ten million dollars, was Brookfield Property Partners, based in Toronto. Brookfield owned the Atlantis in Nassau and the Hard Rock in Las Vegas, and so saw some synergy here, but it couldnât make a deal with the owners of Revelâs adjacent power plant, which had been built solely for Revel and was charging Revel three million dollars a month for utilities. (The power plant was a separate, independently owned entity, called ACR Energy Partnersâan arrangement that has proved poisonous.)

Once, he answered his phone as he was getting fingerprinted by the Casino Control Commission, for his gambling-license application. Another time, he announced that he was at a urinal.

way of talking in a stream-of-consciousness rush, in the manner of an Appalachian Don King, often made his big plans seem scattershot and his tactical explanations disjointed, at least to someone not adept in vulture finance. âHe has a learning disability,â his daughter Kim, a branding consultant in New York, told me. âWhen he was a kid, when it was time to read aloud in class, heâd count the people who were supposed to read before him and then, just before his turn, go to the rest room. Heâs a bit of a savant.â"],["p","Straub comes from Wheeling, West Virginia, where his father had a business providing transportation to the Texas Eastern pipeline and later owned auto-leasing franchises and taxi fleets. âSo you worked, and if you didnât work Dad got the belt out and beat your butt,â Straub said. âAnyway, he died, just when I got my driverâs license.â After high school, Straub and a brother helped run the businesses. In time, they owned a network of sand and gravel quarries and concrete and asphalt plants; highway- and airport-construction contracts made them rich. (In recent years, those long-moribund quarries, in the upper Ohio River Valley, have been found to sit atop vast reserves of oil and gas, extractable by horizontal drill, making Straub even richer.)"],["p","Straub retired at forty, moving his family (his wife, from whom he divorced in 2007, and two daughters) to Florida. âI lasted six months,â he said. He started investing in distressed and bankrupt properties. It was a good time to have cash on hand. In the wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, at a Resolution Trust Corporation auction, he bought a twenty-two-hundred-acre golf and polo club in Wellington, for $27.1 million. It was called Palm Beach Polo. âAll of a sudden, people were giving me a half a million dollars for an acre,â he said. âI sold two or three hundred million dollarsâ worth, and we still have another thousand acres down there.â A big driver was the equestrian center: âNever once thought it would turn out to be a gold mine, but it did turn out to be a gold mine, because then",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%229%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," the Bloombergs of the world and their daughters, and all the movie starsâ daughters, they would go down there, and they would have the big Olympic stars do the show jumping, and there was this thing called polo.

I can pick a fly out of the air.â"],["p","Straub has been called âthe dictator of Palm Beach polo.â His reign has been contentious. In numerous lawsuits, he has been accused of neglecting his residents, as well as the grounds, and charging undue fees. In 2010, he was tried, and ultimately acquitted, on criminal charges of polluting protected wetlands. He was once convicted of contempt, after interfering with a federal marshal whoâd come to seize a yacht at a marina Straub owned. He tried to appeal the verdict all the way to the Supreme Court, without success. Through the years, he has been proudly litigious. âIf you check me out, Iâm pretty good at protecting our rights in the court system,â Straub told me."],["p","In the conference room, he told me about his idea for an ocean liner. âAn old ocean liner, like the QE2. Iâm gonna buy it,â he said. He squeezed mayonnaise from a packet. âBring this ocean liner in, and I donât know if youâve been around Ripleyâs down in Orlando, the whole building shaking and everything else. Iâm gonna teach my kids, or my kidsâ kids, what World War II was all about, and the Holocaust, and Zeros coming in from Japan, and so when you go inside this thing, this ship, itâs gonna make you feel like youâre being bombed, like Pearl Harbor when the damned Zeros came in, took out our whole fleet in the Pacific.

City, formerly a breeding ground for big ideas, was now a tar pitâtrapping financial mastodons and big-eyed dreamers, whether or not their intentions were pure, as the capricious gods of commerce looked on. Revel kept luring in new ones. In April, the day after Straub took ownership of Revel, he called Crandon andâaccording to Crandon, anyway; Straub denies itâoffered to flip the property to him for a hundred million dollars. A couple of days later, Crandon drove down to Atlantic City. With Revel blacked out (owing to the inevitable dispute between Straub and ACR, the power company), the only people allowed inside were security officers from the Casino Control Commission. They stood in darkness guarding acres of idled slot machines, which Straub wasnât technically authorized to own, since he had no gaming license. So, according to Crandon, the two men who would decide Revelâs fate met in one of its parking garages. Crandon had along one of his partners, Don Marrandino, an Atlantic City native known as Rockinâ Don, for his music-industry connections. He had been the president of Hard Rock in Las Vegas and of Caesars East Coast operations. Straub was accompanied by Tara Lordi, his adviser and âtoxic-asset manager,â a horsewoman and former banker. Crandon says Straub told them he wanted much more than a hundred million for Revel, but at least he now had a possible out, and Crandon had an in. (Straub says the meeting never happened.)"],["p","Crandon had been eying Revel for a year. Crandon, who is fifty-three, grew up in Delaware, but his parents were from New Jersey, and as a kid he worked at a service station his grandfather owned on the Black Horse Pike. His surname used to be Ceccola; Crandon is an adaptation of Cranendonk. His father-in-law is Theodor Cranendonk, a wealthy Dutch oil trader who was once imprisoned in Italy on charges of delivering thirty bazookas to the Mafia. (âIt was all made up,â Crandon says. According to Crandon, Dutch commandoes sprung Cranendonk from a prison hospital and brought him back to the Netherlands.) One of Crandonâs investment vehicles is called MidOil, but Cranendonk was not involved in the Revel bid. âHe doesnât do gambling,â Crandon said."],["p","Crandon said his groupââWeâre Jersey guysââplanned to spend hundreds of millions reconfiguring the space. The new name would be Rebel. Crandon said they were planning a forty-night Bon Jovi residency. Rockinâ Don had the pull."],["p","The money wasnât from Jersey guys. Crandon says he spent a marathon weekend in town and in New York wooing representatives from a Chinese real-estate firm that had been buying up properties around the United States. Crandonâs group and the Chinese were betting that Macau, the Asian gambling mecca, was tapped out, amid a Chinese government crackdown on corruption and gambling, and that travellers from mainland China would soon be including South Jersey on their U.S. itineraries. The Atlantic City airport would be the hub for jumbo-jet charters from Asia. The margins are better if you can lure a plane from Hong Kong than a bus from Port Authority. Atlantic City, born in proximity to the population and early industrial wealth of Philadelphia, would now reach halfway around the world for money and the guests from whom to separate it."],["p","Crandon believed that Straub was planning to demolish Revel. A consultant had told him you could net a hundred million dollars if you sold it off as spare parts. There was a precedent: In 2004, Straub bought Miami Arena for twenty-eight million dollars, half what the city had paid to build it. He promised to turn it into a venue for horse shows, conventions, and minor-league sports, to help revive downtown Miami. âTearing it down serves nobodyâs purpose,â Straub said at the time. Four years later, he tore it down."],["p","Events on the ground in Atlantic City seemed to be pushing Straub in that direction. As soon as he bought Revel, he found himself, not unexpectedly, in a war with ACR, the power plant, and thus, in short order, with the city. The maneuverings often seemed frivolous and petty, except that a city was at stake. Straub refused to pay ACR the three million a month for power, and ACR refused to provide it for free. And so Revel remained dark: no light, heat, air, or water, no sprinklers or alarms. The cityâs fire marshal deemed the building unsafe, and the city rescinded Straubâs certificate of occupancy and began fining him five thousand dollars a day. Observers wondered about catastrophic fire and debilitating mold."],["p","Straub dug in. He told reporters, as he unsuccessfully challenged the plantâs owners in court, âWeâll erase them off the map.â He brought in a fleet of diesel generators and parked them outside the casino. But he had no permits, and ACR owned much of the connecting infrastructure. Back to court they went. Straub, the loser again, sent the generators away. He told me, referring to city and state officials, âIf they wonât work with me, Iâll just go back to Miami.â Publicly, he made the threat explicit: âIâll tear the building down.â"],["p","To circumvent ACR, Straub had set about trying",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%2211%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," to buy the empty casino next door, the Showboat, and tap into its power plant instead.

At the end of April, Saatkamp, out of his depth in these sharky waters, resigned as Stocktonâs president, his tenure scuttled by the Showboat and Revel mess.

down and talk with your kids about it.

Your kids should hear about it from you, as soon as is convenient, in a setting thatâs familiar and unthreatening. Chances are, they know about it already, and will be grateful to you for dealing with it openly."],["p","The first time we talked about it with our kids I followed the advice Iâm giving you now. Marjorie and I gathered them together after supper and told them that we needed to talk about something very important. Then we all sat down around the kitchen tableâand I canât stress too strongly how important it is to sit down. Some of the kids kept wanting to stand up, but we kept telling them to sit down. Then, once we were all seated, we began to talk about it. The conversation was forthright, frank, measured, and equal in seriousness to what we were talking about."],["p","When we were finished, we asked the kids if they had any questions or concerns. Our second son, Miles, got a thoughtful look on his face, and posed a question that I remember to this day. âMom, Dad,â he said, with some hesitation. âDid you know that Alfred Hitchcock had his navel surgically removed?â"],["p","Are we always listening as closely as we should be when our kids ask us questions? If Marjorie and I had not talked about what we talked candidly about with our kids that day, Milesâs meaningful question probably would not have come up. Neither of us had ever heard that particular âfactâ about Alfred Hitchcock, so at first we could not be of much help. But we assured Miles that we admired the critical thinking he had used to arrive at his question. His honest inquisitiveness then inspired his sister June, a kindergartner, to ask a follow-up."],["p","âIf a little bee played baseball,â June inquired, âwould he need his whole body just to carry the ball?â"],["p","Springboarding off Juneâs contribution, Jason, age eight, then introduced a tangential line of questioning that put the discussion into deeper perspective. âO.K., Billy Nolan told me this,â Jason began. âIs it true that in an average lifetime an average person eats six spiders in their sleep?â"],["p","Marjorie and I have taught our children that every question is equally validâi.e., there is no such thing as a âwrongâ question. Naturally, when weâve been talking about a subject as full of implications as the subject of our family conference that evening, every question must be weighed respectfully and with due reflection. We now had three topics for further looking into:"],["ol",["li",["p","The Hitchcock-navel question."]],["li",["p","Bees and baseball."]],["li",["p","Spiders being eaten, etc."]]],["p","Each of these had the potential to open a new angle on the important exchange of ideas between our children and ourselves which had begun when we all sat down around the table. Quite honestly, I thought we now had plenty to deal with. Sadik, however, added an interesting sidelight when he asked whether it was possible to make lasagna out of different kinds of ice cream, so I put âLasagna/ice cream?â as No. 4 on our list."],["p","Kids take in so much more than we give them credit for. The wheels in their heads are always turning. As proof of that, Jaden, whoâs five, raised his hand. When Marjorie encouraged him to say what was on his mind, he shyly asked us to guess which part of his nose he had just picked. I was not sure where that question fit on the list I already had, so I started a new list, âJadenâs nose: which part picked?â and told him that we would deal with his question soon."],["p","Perhaps apropos of Juneâs question about the bee, her sister, Mabel, who will be four next month, wondered out loud whether dinosaurs had butts. I admitted I did not see what that had to do with the subject of our family confab, and I pressed, gently, for the relevance of Mabelâs ask. By way of clarification, she offered that Tyler (her older brother, age seven) had said he could kick a dinosaurâs butt, and she, Mabel, did not know if dinosaurs ",["em","had"]," butts. Where to put that question on the lists? I told Mabel that I was writing it on the first list, but in fact I only pretended to."],["p","The twins, Dashiell and Mikey, who are ten and very into tech things, brought up a concern with a limited but real connection to what we were exploring. They asked if Marjorie or I knew what the loudest-decibel burp was. Weâve never pretended to be all knowing, and as it happened we did not have that particular information. Instead we tried, as weâve been trained, to hear the question ",["em","behind"]," the question that the child is asking. After providing a sensitive-listening moment in which Dash and Mikey could expand on this, we discovered that the real question behind the question also had to do with the loudest-decibel burp. Turning to Gus, age twelve, we let him offer some guidance, which he kind of did, by asking if we knew that somebody once made a replica of the âMona Lisaâ entirely out of burnt toast."],["p","I have changed all the childrenâs names in order to protect their privacy. That is, after ill-advisedly using their actual names in this article, I have changed their names in real life. Their well-being must always come first. Sitting down to talk with them has become a weekly ritual, which they seem to value highly even though it drove Marjorie insane several months ago and she ran off with an events planner who has no children. Well-meaning friends say that perhaps what we talked about should not have been talked about to begin with. That is nonsense. You have to talk about it, as an overwhelming percentage of Americans agree.

the way one might to play tennis, but horizontally, like a hammock. He was wearing a pair of too short trousers, perhaps the trousers from last yearâs school uniform, and no shoes.

The room was long and narrow, with a south-facing bay window and another, smaller window overlooking the side garden, where their son was going back and forth between the trees, checking and double-checking his knots. Heâd found the net in the shed. It wasnât their net, though she supposed it was now; it had come with the house, and had belonged to one or other of the people who had owned this place before them. Finn had commandeered it for the purpose of catching dead, or soon to be dead, birds. Birds, it seemed, were the next great heralders of the apocalypse, and Finn had decided that it was important to catch them in the act of falling. Before the birds, there had been two long weeks of insects: a meticulous recording of spiders, flies, and beetles, tallies of the dead entered each night in a blue-lined copybook."],["p","Bill left the window and came to sit beside her at the table. He was wearing an old shirt from his banking days, old but expensive, a Lanvin pinstripe with double cuffs, crumpled because heâd slept in it the night before, and a pair of tracksuit bottoms. Heâd stopped getting his hair cut, and now it hung limp and slightly graying just below his ears."],["p","[audio url=\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/221300546\"]"],["p","âWill you take Finn to school today?â she said. It was half inquiry, half request."],["p","âWeâll see,â he said. âWe donât want to rush things, do we?â"],["p","He took one of the books from the floor beside his chair. It was one she hadnât seen before, a hardback with a picture of an ornate karyÅbinga on the cover, and she looked away to spare herself seeing the price. They were all over the house, these books, and journals, too, little dog-eared towers of them in the bathroom and next to their bed, copies surfacing randomly on kitchen shelves and windowsills. They were about art, mostly: Oriental art, Japanese antiquities, Muromachi paintings, wooden carvings detailed with gold leaf and lacquer. They were the kind of books she might once have bought for herself, books she could still possibly take pleasure in were they not so hideously expensive."],["p","âItâs been almost a month,â she said. âHe needs to go back to school. His suspension ended more than a week ago.â"],["p","Bill didnât answer immediately. Instead, he turned a page with ceremonial reverence, lifting the glossy paper, letting it fall, smoothing a hand across a monotone print depicting a line of leafless trees fronting a temple. âI donât think heâs ready,â he said. He gestured toward the garden, where Finn was leaning into the net, resting his weight on it, testing it. âLook at him. Isnât he happy?â"],["p","Her coat was on the back of her chair, and she took it, draped it across her shoulders. It was cold, this room, even in April, even with the chimney blocked up and insulating tape sealing the splintered frames of the sash windows, the original windows, as the auctioneer had pointed out, practically salivating at the sheer oldness of it all, as she had, too, back then. It was easier for Bill if Finn didnât go to school, she thought; that way he didnât have to walk with the child to the bus stop, and then ride the bus with him into town, didnât have to make his way back, only to repeat the journey when school finished in the afternoon."],["p","âAstonishing, when you consider it,â he said. âThe deep recession into space.â"],["p","âSorry?â she said, before realizing that he was talking about something in the book. He was off then, feeding her random pieces as he read, while she ate a slice of toast and drank her coffee. Above the table, a lead-crystal chandelier hung like a tree in winter, most of its pendants missing. She should take it down and be done with it, she thought. She should put it out in the shed with the rest of the rubbish and pick up something at ",["em",{"class":"small"},"IKEA"],". Sheâd imagined a life for the people whoâd lived here before, had pieced it together from the things theyâd left behindâthe skeleton of a pony trap, its metal spine rusting at the back of the shed, the stone hot-water jars. But it occurred to her now that perhaps sheâd gone about it wrong, that perhaps they were to be known not by what they left but by what they took, in which case she would never know them. Outside the window, Finn was throwing stones of varying size into the center of the net. âIf you do decide to take him to school,â she said, âI found his school tie when I was tidying the playroom. Itâs hanging in his wardrobe.â"],["p","âO.K.,â he said, without looking up, and she knew there would be no school for Finn today."],["p","This is what sheâd told Finn about the ducks: yesterday, in Stephenâs Green, the ducks on one of the ponds had died, the smaller pond with the gunmetal-green railings by the side exit to the shopping center, not one or two of the ducks but all of them. Sheâd seen them as she cut through the park on her way to the office, stopping where a small crowd had gathered. And Bill was right: it was no story for a child, especially not this child, so sensitive that sometimes she thought the very passage of air around him might strip the skin off him. But sheâd arrived home late, and tired, and, on entering the kitchen and seeing them together in easy silence at the table, sheâd felt a need to announce herself, to offer something that might allow access to their world. And so sheâd unleashed it, the story of the ducks, how some were almost wholly submerged, just the tip of a wing or a tail feather breaking the surface of the water, while others lay on the bank, their jewelled heads pressing beak-shaped indents into the silt. One had made it onto the grass and lay toppled beneath the spiked branches of a hawthorn bush, and she knew that if she touched it it would still be warm. All the time she was talking, Finn was looking at her, and she could almost hear the thoughts whirring inside his head. Bill had raised an eyebrow as he dished out mashed potatoes and peas, the only dinner that Finn could be persuaded to eat. Sheâd looked toward the oven to see if perhaps he had cooked something else for her. Heâd followed her gaze. âI could do you an egg if you like,â he said."],["p","âItâs O.K.,â she said. âThis is fine.â She would like to know how exactly Bill passed his days, but this mystery was as unfathomable to her as the lives of the houseâs previous inhabitants. It was not as if he spent much time on home maintenance. Heâd had business cards printed advertising his services as a financial consultant, but thus far no clients had materialized. Sheâd taken a seat opposite Finn at the kitchen table and watched him eat his food the way he always did: peas first, one by one, then the potatoes, all the time his small brow furrowed with such intensity that she imagined the ducks resurrected inside his head, waddling crookedly, beating their wings against the walls."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EShe%20slipped%20her%20arms%20into%20her%20coat%2C%20took%20her%20briefcase%20from%20the%20hall%2C%20and%20went%20outside%2C%20to%20where%20her%20car%20was%20parked%20in%20front%20of%20the%20house.%20%E2%80%9CBye%2C%20Finn%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20called%2C%20and%20raised%20her%20hand%20in%20a%20wave.%20He%20waved%20back%2C%20then%20returned%20to%20the%20task%20of%20untying%20one%20of%20the%20strings.%20Setting%20down%20her%20briefcase%2C%20she%20crossed%20the%20lawn%2C%20the%20heels%20of%20her%20shoes%20sinking%20into%20the%20damp%20ground%2C%20and%20stopped%20beside%20the%20net.%20For%20a%20moment%2C%20she%20considered%20what%20it%20might%20be%20like%20to%20climb%20onto%20it%2C%20to%20close%20her%20eyes%2C%20to%20sleep.%20Finn%20had%20managed%20to%20work%20the%20string%20loose%2C%20and%20now%20he%20was%20circling%20the%20tree%20with%20it%20again%2C%20but%20at%20a%20point%20higher%20up%2C%20round%20and%20round%2C%20preparing%20to%20refasten%20it.%20He%20stopped%20when%20it%20would%20go%20no%20further%20and%20began%20to%20tie%20a%20knot.%20%E2%80%9CHere%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Clet%20me%20do%20that.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CIt%20has%20to%20be%20a%20pipe-hitch%20knot%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CCan%20you%20do%20a%20pipe%20hitch%3F%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522cartoon%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522cartoon%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fcartoon%25252F593b63e18a032b339a0cd50c%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%2522593b63e18a032b339a0cd50c%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b63e18a032b339a0cd50c%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63e18a032b339a0cd50c%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3Cp%3EShe%20shook%20her%20head.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99d%20better%20leave%20you%20to%20it%2C%20then%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESheets%20of%20paper%20were%20spread%20out%20on%20the%20grass.%20Stooping%20to%20get%20a%20better%20look%2C%20she%20saw%20that%20they%20were%20covered%20in%20complex%2C%20intricate%20diagrams%2C%20the%20margins%20scribbled%20with%20words%20like%20%E2%80%9Cplague%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Capocalypse%E2%80%9D%20and%20little%20hand-drawn%20pictures%20of%20birds%2C%20small%2C%20fat-bellied%20things%20with%20disproportionately%20long%20legs%20and%20large%20feet.%20Among%20the%20drawings%20was%20a%20copy%20of%20a%20magazine%2C%20a%20publication%20brought%20to%20the%20house%20from%20time%20to%20time%20by%20a%20preacher%20woman.%20She%20was%20one%20of%20the%20few%20people%20who%20braved%20the%20muddy%20lane%20to%20visit%20them%20or%2C%20more%20precisely%2C%20to%20visit%20Bill%20and%20Finn%2C%20because%20she%20always%20called%20in%20the%20daytime.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CWas%20the%20preacher%20here%3F%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%2C%20picking%20up%20the%20magazine.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CYou%20mean%20Molly%3F%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESince%20when%20was%20he%20on%20first-name%20terms%20with%20the%20preacher%20woman%3F%20%E2%80%9CIs%20that%20what%20she%E2%80%99s%20called%3F%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CYes.%E2%80%9D%20He%E2%80%99d%20completed%20the%20knot%2C%20and%20was%20tugging%20on%20the%20ends%20to%20see%20if%20it%20would%20hold.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CSo%20when%20was%20Molly%20here%3F%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CYesterday.%20But%20she%20couldn%E2%80%99t%20stay%20long.%20She%20had%20to%20go%20visit%20a%20woman%20who%E2%80%99s%20come%20all%20the%20way%20from%20Virginia%20to%20live%20up%20by%20the%20lake.%E2%80%9D%20Satisfied%20with%20the%20knot%2C%20he%20turned%20to%20his%20mother.%20%E2%80%9CVirginia%20is%20a%20girl%E2%80%99s%20name%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cbut%20it%E2%80%99s%20also%20a%20place%20in%20America.%20The%20first%20peanuts%20ever%20grown%20in%20America%20were%20grown%20in%20Virginia%2C%20but%20now%20the%20people%20of%20Virginia%20mostly%20grow%20tobacco%2C%20which%20is%20immoral%20and%20also%20causes%20plagues.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CWhat%E2%80%99s%20Molly%20like%3F%E2%80%9D%20she%20said%2C%20conscious%20that%20she%20should%20be%20on%20the%20road%20already.%20Delay%20would%20be%20paid%20for%20at%20an%20extortionate%20rate%3B%20ten%20mi

slipped her arms into her coat, took her briefcase from the hall, and went outside, to where her car was parked in front of the house. âBye, Finn,â she called, and raised her hand in a wave. He waved back, then returned to the task of untying one of the strings. Setting down her briefcase, she crossed the lawn, the heels of her shoes sinking into the damp ground, and stopped beside the net.

A developer, having no use for the house itself, had fenced it off and sold it, together with an acre of garden. When she and Bill had first viewed it, there had been a pair of tall wrought-iron gates at the end of the avenue, but by the time they moved in the gates were gone, taken, sheâd learned later, by a creditor of the builder. The wasteland was meant to be Phase 2 of a development of three-bed semis. Last winter, a storm had felled the advertising hoardings along the perimeter and now they lay half buried in the grass, their peeling fragments of swings and smiling lovers and flowerbeds like remnants of an ancient mosaic. Phase 1 was a field distant, a ghost estate already sliding into dereliction.

Eventually, a duck plodded out, dazedly, as if the van were a hard-shelled futuristic egg from which it had just hatched. It stood, bemused, on the ramp for a moment, and then suddenly there were more ducks behind it, pushing and jostling, and it was too late for it to turn back. A dozen of them, maybe more, descended onto the grass, a mixture of lustrous greens and blues and mottled browns, and, as the warden herded them toward the water, a child began to throw bread, striking one of them on the head.

was driving home shortly after 6 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"P.M."]," with the radio set to a music station. She liked this stretch of the commute, the city traffic behind her, the winding country roads that led into Portlaoise, then out of it again. There was a particular house that drew her eye each evening, a house of the same period and style as their own, early-nineteenth-century Georgian, but better tended. In winter, candles in glass jars hung from holly trees, and now, in late spring, daffodils bloomed on either side of the long avenue. This evening, as she drove past, she felt not inspired but admonished. If it was still light by the time they finished dinner, she would attempt a clear-up of the beehives in the southwest corner of their property. She would ask Finn to help her; it might take his mind off all things dead. They could paint the hives different colors, use them as planting boxes; she had no desire to keep bees. Items of beekeeping equipmentâa suit, a veiled hat, a smokerâhad been among the things left behind in the shed, and sheâd taken this as evidence that the people who had lived here before were beekeepers, but perhaps it was better evidence that they were not; that they were, at best, failed beekeepers. And for no reason that she could point to she knew that the beekeeping paraphernalia hadnât belonged to the same person as the pony trap; these things, she was sure, were the leavings of two different people, the discarded parings of two separate lives."],["p","It had rained earlier in the afternoon, a light drizzle, and the three steps that led to the front door were slippery. Above the door, just below the box that housed the burglar alarm, was a domed copper bell. The rope pull was missing, but the metal tongue remained, and she was still startled occasionally, in strong winds, by a shrill, high note. Letting herself into the hall, she thought she detected the smell of something cooking, something other than potatoes and peas. Bill came out of the kitchen to greet her. âGuess what,â he said. âIâve got an interview.â"],["p","âThatâs great,â she said, trying not to look too surprised, because sheâd begun to suspect that he no longer applied for jobs. âWhatâs it for?â"],["p","âA position at the museum in Athy.â"],["p","âThe museum?â she said, puzzled. âYou mean in the accounts department?â"],["p","âItâs more hands on,â he said. âCataloguing exhibits, working on the archives, that sort of thing.â"],["p","Careful, she warned herself, careful how you play this. Mentally, she had already begun to calculate the cost of his return bus fare, adding to it the cost of new work clothes, the cost of paying someone to mind their son. To buy a little time, she busied herself with hanging her coat on a peg and then, turning to him again, said, âWhereâs Finn?â"],["p","âHeâs in the kitchen,â Bill said, âworrying about ducks.â He began to walk back down the hall, and she followed him. âSo how much does the job pay?â she asked, doing her best to sound casual."],["p","âThey said we can discuss salary at the interview.â"],["p","âBut they do actually pay?â"],["p","âOf course.â He halted in the doorway of the kitchen and frowned. âYou could try to sound more pleased,â he said. âYou wanted me to get a job. Well, thatâs what Iâm doing.â"],["p","She felt like telling him that this had nothing to do with want; that what either of them might have wanted had stopped being relevant a long time ago. âSorry,â she said, âI justÂ .Â .Â . you knowÂ .Â .Â . When is the interview?â"],["p","âTomorrow at four. Which means Iâll need to leave here just after three.â"],["p","âBut who will look after Finn?â"],["p","âI thought you could take the afternoon off.â"],["p","âI have appointments,â she said. âIf Iâd had more noticeÂ .Â .Â .â She saw then that Finn was sitting at the kitchen table, and that the thing he had on a plate in front of him, which at first glance sheâd taken for a soft toy, was in fact a dead bird. Easy does it, she thought, deep breaths. She went over and stood beside him. He looked up from poking the bird with a fork, and smiled. It was small and dark, with black and brown feathers, its pinkish claws curled. âDid you catch it in your net?â she said. She pictured it dropping from the sky, the taut bounce as it rose only to fall back again."],["p","âNo,â he said, âI found it by the river.â"],["p","She watched as he plucked a feather from the birdâs belly. âWhat are you doing?â she said. âIt might be diseased.â"],["p","âIt ",["em","is"]," diseased,â he said. âItâs got plague.â He was pulling out feathers in swift sharp yanks, leaving a clearing of pink-hued skin bubbled with goose bumps. He picked up a knife and prodded the cleared patch as if he were about to make an incision. âO.K.,â she said. âThatâs enough, get it off the table right now.â Behind her, Bill was taking something from the oven. It was the first time he had cooked properly in weeks. She watched as he peeled the foil cover from a roasting tin, and when the rush of steam dispersed she saw that it was a chicken."],["p","After dinner, Bill disappeared into the room off the kitchen that they used as a TV room. She had abandoned the idea of interesting Finn in the beehives; heâd eaten his potatoes and peas, then taken the feathered cadaver out to the garden, where he sat examining it, so engrossed that she didnât have the heart to take it from him. She washed up before joining Bill in the TV room. It was a small space that might once have been a maidâs room, and was easier to heat than the larger rooms at the front. Bill was sitting in an armchair, toasting his socked feet on the bars of an electric fire. The husband of one of her colleagues had taken a job in Dubai last year. It was difficult, of course, her colleague had said, but every second month she left the kids with her mother and flew out for a week. In three yearsâ time, they would be back on their feet; it would be worth it. Looking at Bill now, sitting there reading one of his art journals, she wished that he would go to Dubai, too; it shocked her, the force with which she wished this, as did the composure with which she found herself contemplating it. She went to a cupboard and took out a bottle of brandy left over from Christmas, and poured a measure for herself, another for him. He took the glass from her, but said nothing."],["p","âMaybe you could take Finn with you tomorrow?â she said."],["p","He looked up from his journal. âTurn up with a kid in tow? I might as well not bother.â"],["p","And she saw now how this would unfold, how anytime in the future that she hinted he should get a job it would come back to this: heâd wanted to, heâd tried, sheâd thwarted it. She took a mouthful of brandy. âI think you should go,â she said."],["p","âWhat about your appointments?â"],["p","âI canât get out of the first one, but Iâll ask someone to cover the later ones. Put on one of Finnâs DVDs for him. Iâll be home by three-thirty.â"],["p","âYou mean leave him on his own?â"],["p","She was tempted to say that it wouldnât be very different from any other day. As best as she could tell, Bill mostly seemed to leave the boy to his own devices. âItâs only for half an hour,â she said. âHeâll be fine.

pony trap had most likely belonged to a woman called Eliza Harriet Smithwick, who, according to the title deeds, had been granted a life interest in the house and a hundred acres as part of a marriage settlement in 1886. An ancestor of hers had acquired the land from the Earl of Mountrath for the princely sum of eighty pounds, ten shillings. Oh, how she and Bill had laughed with the solicitor about thatâeighty pounds, ten shillings!âbecause it was possible for anything to be funny in those days, anything at all. Theyâd bought in those last few weeks before the crash, when the market, like a ball in flight, had quietly, imperceptibly stopped rising, had hung for a millisecond at the peak of its trajectory before it began to drop."],["p","She was thinking about this as she drove too fast up the avenue the following evening, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. It was just after five-fifteen. Nobody had been able to cover her appointments, or, more accurately, nobody had been willing to. It was like that at work lately: everybody pretending busyness, everybody watching, the way children in a parlor game watch the chairs, knowing that the music could stop at any moment. Bill had telephoned at two, inquiring as to the whereabouts of a particular blue shirt. âBe sure to lock the doors,â sheâd said, to which heâd replied that he always locked them, this being a downright lie. She didnât tell him that sheâd be late."],["p","As it turned out, the front door was locked. Stepping into the hall, she heard canned laughter and the soundtrack of a cartoon. âHey, Finn,â she called, putting down her briefcase. She hung up her coat and looked into the TV room. A plate of peas was abandoned on the floor beside the armchair. A DVD was playing, but the room was empty. âFinn?â she called again. âFinn, sweetheart, Momâs home.â He wasnât in his bedroom, either. She went from room to room upstairs, then downstairs again, where, in the dining room, she noticed the curtains moving and saw that the window was open."],["p","She continued to call his name as she circled the house and garden. She climbed through the post-and-rail fence and into the wasteland next door. From where she stood, she could see as far as the rough track that ran along the river, and, in the next field, the rows of unfinished houses. She cupped her hands around her mouth. âFinn!â she shouted."],["p","A man was walking at speed along the track, breaking now and again into a run. He veered off and came toward her, his head bent, his hands in the pockets of his anorak. He was in his thirties, she guessed, with straggly brown hair and a reddish-brown beard, a colony of pimples on one cheek. âI heard you calling him,â he said. âI know where he is.â"],["p","âWhere?â she said."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b63e457b86d47b169c721%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63e457b86d47b169c721%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b63e457b86d47b169c721%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b63e457b86d47b169c721"}]],["p","âOver there.â He pointed to the houses. âI seen him earlier.â His anorak was torn, and he was wearing dirty gray trainers and no socks."],["p","âThank you,â she said curtly. She took a step forward, but he remained positioned in front of her."],["p","âI seen you going off in your car sometimes,â he said. âIn the mornings.â"],["p","She wondered if this was an attempt to intimidate her, but he was grinning, the grin open and a little vacuous, and she decided he was probably harmless. âYes,â she said, âthatâs right. I work in the city.â She stepped around him and walked quickly in an effort to put some distance between them, picking her way over a coil of discarded wire that wound snakelike through the grass. He caught up and walked alongside her, so close that his arm brushed against hers. She would run to one of the occupied houses if he got awkward, she decided; she was nearer to them now than she was to her own house."],["p","âThrough here,â the man said. He had scurried ahead, and was pulling wide an opening in the chain-link fence. He was as eager as a child, smiling as he held the mesh open, and she noticed that his wrists were frail and thin and scarred. She stooped to fit through the gap, and as she did she felt his hand, briefly, on the small of her back. In the next field, dozens of houses stretched out in front of her. Most of the windows had been smashed, and they stood blind in the late-afternoon light, surrounded by weeds and litter. There, still, were the refuse sacks she remembered from before, but there was no van, nothing to suggest that anyone was living here. The man led her across ground strewn with cans and broken glass to a house in the middle of a row. âIn here,â he said, climbing over a window ledge, but she shook her head. The earth beneath the ledge was churned up, indented with footprints of various sizes. âWhereâs my son?â she said."],["p","The man was standing in what had likely been intended as a sitting room. The floor was rough concrete, and seeds blown into its crevices had taken root, weeds pushing up through cracks. She saw in one corner a mug that belonged to Finn and next to it the jacket that her sister had given him for his birthday. How long had he been coming to this place? she wondered. How long had he been hanging out with this man? Because the manâs belongings were here, tooâclothes, cardboard boxes, a sleeping bagâall piled in the center of the room. She took a deep breath. âYou told me you saw him,â she said. âNow, can you please tell me where he is?â He picked up a metal rod from a pile of rubbish and struck it on the floor a couple of times. Swinging it back and forth, he crossed the room to the fireplace. She saw then that a thing she had taken for a bundle of rags was a dog stretched out, dead, its head at an odd angle to its body. There was a large bald circle on its back and, in the center of the circle, a wine-colored spot, like a birthmark, fading into softer reds and pinks as it radiated outward. Gripping the rod in both hands, the man raised it high, then brought it down again, piercing the dog through the stomach."],["p","âWhere is he?â she screamed, banging the window ledge with her fist. âWhat have you done with him?â"],["p","He stared at her blankly and rubbed the back of one hand across his eyes, as if heâd just woken. âHe was here this morning,â he said."],["p","She turned and ran, back to the gap in the fence, tripping on the way, falling and tearing her tights. Her hands were shaking as she struggled to part the wire mesh and squeeze through. When sheâd gone a little distance, she stopped to catch her breath. She looked behind to see if the man was following, but there was no sign of him. She stood for a moment and tried to think what to do. It was possible that while sheâd been here Finn had returned home, climbed back in through the window, and was there now, waiting for her, or for his father, who would be home shortly. It was also possible that he was down by the river, searching for dead things, so absorbed in his activities that he hadnât heard her. Other possibilities crowded in on the heels of these, but she pushed them aside. She looked toward their house and saw it as a stranger might: an abandoned outpost, stately but diminished, plundered. The sun had moved lower in the sky, and now it caught the glass of the windows, causing them to blaze as if theyâd been set alight. For a moment, she imagined she saw the face of a woman pressed against a pane. What became of Eliza Harriet Smithwick, she wondered, and what would she think if she saw what had been done to her house and her gardens. She became aware of a stinging pain in her leg and, looking down, noticed that her knee was bleeding. âFinn!â she shouted."],["p","And then she heard it: a yell, a small, joyous bellow of trumpeting delight that was her sonâs voice, coming from the direction of the river. She turned and saw him cresting the grassy embankment above the water, sun reflecting off the near-white blond of his hair. She began to run toward him. He had a stick in his hand, and he was waving it in the air like a sword and making whooping noises. She was within a dozen yards of him before she realized that he was not alone. Lying on the grass, reading, was a slim, tanned woman of about thirty. Sunlight filtered through the trees, parting the shadows along the bank, streaking her long hair. The woman raised her eyes from her book. It was a Bible bound in brown leather, and before she closed it and sat up she marked her page with a yellow ribbon. âHello,â she said, shading her eyes with her hand. âIsnât it a glorious day? We thought it a shame to stay indoors.â Finn waved to his mother but didnât go to her. He seated himself next to the woman and picked up a magazine from a pile on the ground."],["p","Was it possible that they could have been here all this time and not heard her calling? She was conscious of her torn tights, her bleeding leg, the incongruity of her tailored jacket and pencil skirt, here where everything was peaceful, where sunlight dappled her childâs blond head and weeds in flurries of blue and white bloomed along the riverbank. She crouched beside her son and hugged him. âFinn,â she said, âI was so worried about you.â He smiled but, shrugging away her arms, continued to read. Not knowing what to do, she settled herself next to him, tucking her legs underneath her to hide the bloodied knee. The preacher womanâs legs were bare, she noticed, bare and brown. She wondered if Finn had simply climbed out the window to the woman or if she, before luring him, Pied Piper style, across the fields, had climbed in. She pictured her going from room to room, sitting at the mahogany table under the ravaged chandelier, her green catlike eyes, which, yes, were ridiculously like Angelina Jolieâs, taking in all the brokenness. âWe come down here sometimes when the weather is good,â the woman said. âFinn knows the names of everythingâinsects, birds, plants. Heâs a walking encyclopedia.â"],["p","Stay away from my son, she wanted to say, stay away from him with your beasts and your lakes of fire and your pestilence. Instead, she said, âYes, heâs an exceptionally bright child.â And, because in the silence that followed it seemed that something more was expected of her, she gestured to a cluster of purple flowers with yellow hearts that grew a few feet away. Possibly, they were violets; she had never been good with plants. âTheyâre beautiful, arenât they?â she said."],["p","The woman smiled. She picked up her Bible, opening it not to the place she had marked but to a different page, and began to read. âConsider the lilies of the field,â she said, âhow they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.â There was a soft, swishing sound, the sound of someone moving through long grass. Bill was making his way toward them across the wasteland, his jacket thrown over one shoulder, his gait relaxed, unhurried. âDad!â Finn shouted, and he jumped up and ran to his father."],["p","She kept her eyes on her husband until she knew he was near enough to have seen her, and when he didnât wave or call out she turned away. She lay back on the grass and looked up. A flock of small birds, starlings perhaps, were flying in an arrow formation above the trees. As she watched, they drew close together to form a dark, quivering orb. For a moment, they appeared freeze-framed, as if someone had pressed pause, and, just as she thought that they would surely fall, they scattered like gunshot across the evening sky.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/in-the-act-of-falling","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cbae56e652c902746c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apocalypse","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"apocalypse"},{"id":"5c2e1d2c397f5b30646d0690","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bibles","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bibles"},{"id":"5c2e1c8781ab3335f580f184","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Birds","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"birds"},{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1c962396212cbb9fc9be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Children","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"children"},{"id":"5c2e1c792bc86f2c9a24499a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Dogs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"dogs"},{"id":"5c2e1c7c36cecf40192141d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environment"},{"id":"5c2e1c83ee7fe02cbd163340","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fathers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fathers"},{"id":"5c2e1cd636cecf4019214272","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Houses","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"houses"},{"id":"5c2e1ca841e4c73c088d77b6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Husbands","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"husbands"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b81ab3335f580f18d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ireland","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ireland"},{"id":"5c2e1c842bfcc72cd92d0538","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kidnapping","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kidnapping"},{"id":"5c2e1cb44a08312cd3aa6c8b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Marriages","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"marriages"},{"id":"5c2e1c92b75f002c8941e497","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Missionaries","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"missionaries"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c36cecf40192141f6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mothers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mothers"},{"id":"5c2e1c8436cecf40192141df","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Parents","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"parents"},{"id":"5c2e1ca941c92e2c9b85da68","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wives","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wives"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5907efd0019dfc3494e9c92f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Fiction","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fiction"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Fiction","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":n

Thomas concludes his three-volume history of the Spanish Empire with Philip IIâs expansion of his territory in the late sixteenth century. Sweeping across the Americas to the Philippines, Spain built the largest empire since the Romans, and maintained it, in an unparalleled feat of bureaucracy, for three centuries. Thomas challenges historical views of the empire as unflinchingly cruel and rapacious, noting particularly the educational achievements of the Jesuits. The aim is less apology than a full accounting of a complex, often baffling story, one in which conquistadores binge-read chivalric romance novels; Indians pursue litigation to settle disputes with their conquerors; and committees convene to discuss the Kingâs right to invade China."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22feature-small%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22callout%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522callout%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522inset-left%2522%252C%2522body%2522%253A%2522%253Cinline-embed%2520type%253D%255C%2522image%255C%2522%2520meta%253D%255C%2522%25257B%252522type%252522%25253A%252522image%252522%25252C%252522url%252522%25253A%252522%25252Fphotos%25252F5909700aebe912338a376f0a%252522%25252C%252522width%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522height%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25252C%252522caption%252522%25253A%252522%252522%25257D%255C%2522%2520ref%253D%255C%25225909700aebe912338a376f0a%255C%2522%253E%253C%252Finline-embed%253E%2522%252C%2522attrs%2522%253A%257B%257D%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22%5C%22%3E%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5909700aebe912338a376f0a%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225909700aebe912338a376f0a%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22image%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522image%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fphotos%252F5909700aebe912338a376f0a%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%225909700aebe912338a376f0a%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"image","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22image%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fphotos%2F5909700aebe912338a376f0a%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"5909700aebe912338a376f0a"}]]],["p",["strong","God and Jetfire"],["em",", by Amy Seek (Farrar, Straus & Giroux)"],".

The woman, Tam, is a former war pilot; she is at the airport because she is leaving her lover, Niall. But the storyâs focus is on the struggles of the muralâs artist, the real-life Canadian painter Kenneth Lochhead, and on the troubled relationship between Niall and his brother Kieran, who is missing.

sparkle of clear water on white sand in the Florida Keys; and somewhere, remote and hidden within that sparkle, an even more thrilling sparkle: gold! As a boy, this amateur treasure hunter (unsuccessful, now retired) used to dream about the lost treasures of the Keys. Often he visited Mel Fisherâs Treasure Salvors museum, in Key West, when the amateurâs grandmother lived nearby. Mel Fisher was the greatest treasure hunter of all time. In that island city of long shots, no shot as long as Fisherâs ever came in so spectacularly. In 1985, after sixteen and a half years of searching, Fisherâs crew found the wreck of the Spanish treasure galleon Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Atocha, and the discovery rocked Key West to its white coral foundations. No treasure ship as rich had ever been found."],["p","The Atocha went down off the Marquesas in a hurricane on September 6, 1622. On a hot evening in August, 2015, more than a hundred and twenty-five items from the cargo of the Atocha and other Mel Fisher finds were put up for auction by Guernseyâs Auction House at a gallery on Madison Avenueâa âdonât missâ event, from the amateurâs point of view. He arrived early. In a second-floor room with maps and watercolors on the walls, the treasures were radiating light from tall, shelved display cases. Beside them, like a best friend, stood a tall security guard. In the corner, wearing a lavalier microphone, Taffi Fisher-Abt, Mel Fisherâs daughter, said to a camera-toting interviewer, âMy father always told me, âThese treasures used to belong to somebody, and we are their custodians now, and someday theyâll belong to someone else. Then those people will be gone, too, but the treasures will remain. People disappear, but gold shines forever.âÂ â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b6405c195de33cba58fc0%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b6405c195de33cba58fc0%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b6405c195de33cba58fc0%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b6405c195de33cba58fc0"}]],["p","In the adjoining room, Joanne Grant, an auctioneer with dark hair, dark-rimmed glasses, and bright-red lipstick, began the auction with the silver coins, including the âpieces of eight.â The amateur remembered a long-ago time when âpieces of eightâ had been for him a term of untrammelled romance. This evening, a piece of eight could be got for two hundred and fifty dollars, or for forty-two hundred and fifty dollars, or for something in between. âNow you need to be at four thousand five hundred dollars,â the auctioneer gently advised a faltering bidder, who blinked and then kept silent. A long gold chain, a massive emerald, a gold chalice of unbelievable loveliness and delicacy, a reliquary pendant that had once held a devotional painting, long worn away by the sea, except for the gilt haloâall this and more went to a young man who pushed his sunglasses back on his head and bid hundreds of thousands while also talking on a cell phone. âSold to the telephone,â the auctioneer said, over and over."],["p","Fisher, who died in 1998, sometimes used to lead tours of his museum himself. He was a big, affable man with pale-blue eyes. The terrible pain concentrated in the treasure from its cruel beginnings had echoes in his own life. In 1975, Fisherâs son Dirk, his daughter-in-law Angel, and a hired diver drowned when the anchored salvage boat aboard which they were sleeping capsized late at night, because of a faulty ballast system. Fisherâs eyes often seemed to gleam with reflected gold and wince with unspoken pain. At the end of the museum tour, he sometimes took out the bosunâs whistle recovered from the Atocha and blew a long, high-pitched, eerie call on it. He said that, along with the howling of the wind and the waves, the whistle would have been among the last sounds the people on the Atocha heard."],["p","Taffi Fisher-Abt is the kind of non-New Yorker who smiles at strangers and has a friendly word for everybody. After the auction, the amateur asked her if the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum, as itâs now called, still had the bosunâs whistle. She said it is in the collection of a Delaware college; a big supporter of her dadâs donated it. The amateur asked if she felt satisfied with the auctionâs results. âPretty much,â she said. âSome things did better than I expected, some worse. Mostly Iâm glad that we raised some money for our Michael Abt Jr. Have a Heart Foundation. In 2006, our twelve-year-old son, Michael, died at school during gym class from S.C.A.âsudden cardiac arrest. If the school had had a defibrillator he couldâve been saved. Our goal is to raise enough money to provide defibrillators and train teachers how to use them in every school nationwide.

American stage a fresh sound. Duncan Sheik and Steven Saterâs adaptation of the 1891 Frank Wedekind drama set the repressed sexuality of nineteenth-century German teen-agers against the modern release of rock and dance. The show won a slew of Tony Awards, including Best Musical, but closed on Broadway after little more than two years. Fortunately, itâs back, in an inventive revival by Deaf West Theatre. Performed in sign language and spoken English (characters are double-cast with deaf and hearing actors), Michael Ardenâs production, at the Brooks Atkinson, features more than twenty performers

century ago, on Mt. Scopus, in Jerusalem, Albert Einstein gave the first lecture at the future Hebrew University, a ninety-minute inquest into cosmic mysteries: the meaning of time, the properties of light. In June, 2014, Sayed Kashua, a novelist, columnist, television writer, and perhaps the most visible representative of Palestinian life in Israel, trudged to the same spot with a more earthbound goal. A reluctant public speaker, he was there to deliver a commencement address to the graduating class. His subject was life between languages, familiar ground for an author who identifies himself as Palestinian but writes solely in Hebrew. Though he was given only fifteen minutes, the invitation was unprecedentedâthe first time the university had brought in an Arab to speak at graduation."],["p","Kashua, who is forty, with thick, once black hair and a brooding gaze, slouched a little behind the lectern. He grew up in Tira, an Arab village in central Israel, in a family of fruit farmers who had lived in the same house since the days of the British Mandate. In the past decade, he has become the kind of writer whose column, in the left-leaning newspaper ",["em","Haaretz"],", âpeople hang on their fridge,â as a colleague put it. In 2007, a sitcom he wrote, titled âArab Laborâ (a Sabra idiom for second-rate work), had its dÃ©but, introducing an Arab family to Israeli audiences for the first time. It made him a celebrity not just on the comfortable left but, as one television executive told me, among âtaxi-drivers and supporters of Beitar,â a Jerusalem soccer club whose right-wing fans have been known to chant âI hate all Arabs.â"],["p","Standing before the students and their families, Kashua decided to say a few words about the political climate. These were agitated days. A week earlier, three Israeli teen-agers had been kidnapped while hitching a ride in a settlement south of Jerusalem. Kashua recounted how his son told him about it, garbling the news reports and the results of that summerâs World Cup soccer tournament. In a recent game, the Netherlands had grabbed five goals; now, his son said, âPalestine grabbed three.â His line drew nervous laughs, and Kashua quickly reassured the crowd: âItâs my fervent hopeÂ .Â .Â . the boys will be back home, safe and sound.â But he confessed to feeling âa stabbing in the chest,â and asked, âDoes the hope that they will return home imply some sort of declaration that the settlements can be considered legitimate?â"],["p","The next day, Ynet, the most widely read news site in Israel, ran a story about Kashuaâs speech. It quoted one graduate saying that Kashua had complained that his children âbothered himâ with news of the kidnapping âwhile he tried to watch the World Cup.â Another student said, âKashua used the technique of joke-telling but injected his speech with radical statements.â"],["p","Political debate in Israel is vigorous, if not always elegant, often summoning the old Hebrew phrase that describes âa dialogue between deaf people.â But it has been dampened in recent years by a series of government-sponsored bills: one demanding that non-Jewish Israelis take loyalty oaths; another authorizing the finance ministry to withhold funds from organizations deemedâhowever vaguelyâto be violating Israelâs foundational tenet of a âJewish and democraticâ state. Kashua, like other Arab Israelis in the public eye, was used to having his words scrutinized. But the summerâs events felt different. As the conflict in Gaza escalated into war, the premiÃ¨re of a movie based on his memoir âDancing Arabsâ was hastily scrapped. Flag-draped extremists in Tel Aviv brandished metal rods at antiwar demonstrators. The atmosphere of intimidation became so intense that Ayman Odeh, the youthful leader of the Joint List, an alliance of Arab-backed parties that represent Palestinian aspirations in Israel, announced that an âage of ostracismâ had taken hold."],["p","Within the Green Line that separates Israel proper from Gaza and the West Bank, Arab Israelis make up twenty per cent of the population. For liberal Israelis, and for Arabs who hope to be accepted as equals, Kashua embodied the countryâs stated ideal of coexistenceâof Arab Israelisâ full legal and civil integration. For a decade, he had lived with his wife, Najat, in Ramat Denya, a Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem, and their children attended the cityâs only bilingual school. In a country where columnists have a flair for grandiloquence, Kashuaâs columns are conversational, confiding, anecdotal, centered on the rituals and trials of bourgeois life, like the âholiday tourâ that includes stopping at sixteen relativesâ houses, or the visiting electrician who reprimands him for his childrenâs excessive television viewing. While his writing is rarely explicitly political, a sense of uprootedness lurks; when the electrician, also an Arab, overhears the kids speaking Hebrew, Kashua canât stop apologizing."],["p","Coexistence of the kind that Kashua represents seems increasingly out of reach these days, when more than a third of Jewish Israelis openly say that Arab citizens shouldnât be entitled to equal rights. Of 1.7 million Arabs in Israel, perhaps forty thousand lead middle-class lives in mixed cities. Ayman Odeh told me that his partyâs goal is for Arab citizens âto take part in every institution in the countryâexcept for security, foreign relations, and immigration absorption, because these institutions blur the lines of our national identity.â But even his more hopeful speeches donât envision such inclusiveness for ten more years."],["p","Two weeks after Kashuaâs commencement address, searchers discovered the bodies of the three kidnapped teen-agers in a mound of rocks in a field near Hebron. In Jerusalem, far-right protesters called on Jews to avenge the murders. Kashua watched the news, terrified. As far as he knew, there were only five Arabs living in Ramat Denya: him, Najat, and their three children. When air-raid sirens warned of incoming rockets from Gaza, Kashua sent his kids to the bomb shelter, but he stayed away, uneasy around his neighbors. One day, his teen-age daughter was pummelled with water bottles, apparently for being Arab."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EA%20day%20after%20the%20teen-agers%E2%80%99%20funerals%2C%20a%20sixteen-year-old%20Palestinian%20was%20found%20dead%20amid%20the%20pines%20in%20the%20Jerusalem%20Forest.%20He%20had%20been%20bludgeoned%20and%20burned%20alive%E2%80%94an%20act%20of%20revenge%20for%20the%20teen-agers%E2%80%99%20murder%2C%20his%20killers%20later%20claimed.%20After%20that%2C%20Kashua%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20my%20children%20to%20leave%20the%20house.%E2%80%9D%20He%20was%20scheduled%20to%20depart%20later%20that%20summer%20with%20his%20family%20for%20Champaign%2C%20Illinois%2C%20to%20teach%20for%20a%20year%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Illinois%20campus%20there.%20He%20moved%20up%20the%20date%20of%20their%20flight%20and%20changed%20the%20tickets%20to%20one-way.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20not%20coming%20back%20to%20this%20building%2C%20not%20coming%20back%20to%20this%20neighborhood%2C%20not%20coming%20back%20to%20Jerusalem%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20wrote%20in%20his%20%3Cem%3EHaaretz%3C%2Fem%3E%20column.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20lie%20I%E2%80%99d%20told%20my%20children%20about%20a%20future%20in%20which%20Arabs%20and%20Jews%20share%20the%20country%20equally%20was%20over.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EFor%20Kashua%E2%80%99s%20faithful%20readers%2C%20his%20departure%20symbolized%20the%20country%E2%80%99s%20decline%20into%20angry%20factionalism.%20The%20Israeli%20author%20Amos%20Oz%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20fact%20that%20he%20left%20saddened%20me%20greatly.%20I%20can%20tell%20you%20that%20over%20the%20summer%20there%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20a%20decent%20Israeli%20who%20didn%E2%80%99t%20have%20similar%20thoughts.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20the%20day%20the%20Kashuas%20were%20to%20leave%2C%20they%20scurried%20to%20prepare.%20A%20news%20crew%20from%20the%20investigative%20program%20%E2%80%9CFact%E2%80%9D%20followed%20them%20as%20Najat%20filled%20large%20plastic%20bags%20with%20food.%20%E2%80%9CThey%20practically%20left%20with%20the%20pots%20still%20on%20the%20stove%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20neighbor%20told%20me.%20That%20night%2C%20a%20minivan%20drove%20the%20family%20to%20Ben-Gurion%20Airport.%20But%20first%E2%80%94snaking%20northwest%2C%20on%20rutted%20roads%E2%80%94they%20stopped%20in%20Tira.%20Under%20moonlight%2C%20Kashua%20kissed%20his%20relatives%20goodbye.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ll%20send%20you%20all%20Adidas%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20joked%2C%20as%20his%20mother%20cried%20silently%20in%20the%20background.%20His%20father%2C%20Darwish%2C%20sat%20by%20a%20picket%20fence%20in%20the%20back%20yard%2C%20smoking%20a%20cigarette.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20didn%E2%80%99t%20even%20consult%2C%E2%80%9D%20Darwish%20said%2C%20visibly%20shaken.%20%E2%80%9CHe%20said%2C%20%E2%80%98That%E2%80%99s%20it%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20leaving%20the%20country.%E2%80%99%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20Finally%2C%20Sayed%20approached%20him.%20%E2%80%9CBye%2C%20Aba%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%20softly.%20The%20two%20men%20embraced.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20the%20airplane%2C%20the%20heat%20of%20the%20day%20replaced%20by%20the%20cool%20nothing-air%20of%20transit%2C%20Kashua%20vowed%20that%20he%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20return.%20%E2%80%9CPlease%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said%20under%20his%20breath%2C%20%E2%80%9Ctake%20me%20far%2C%20far%20away.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","A day after the teen-agersâ funerals, a sixteen-year-old Palestinian was found dead amid the pines in the Jerusalem Forest.

story of how Sayed Kashua came to write about Sayed Kashua sounds like a typical Sayed Kashua tale: the result of equal parts constraint and conviction. When he was sixteen, the only Arab student in his high-school class in Jerusalem, a teacher assigned an essay about a day in the life of a figure of the studentsâ choice. Kashua had the idea of writingââhardcore-like,â he saidâabout a dead person. But a classmate who had lost her father asked if she could take the idea. He decided instead to tackle the only subject he knew well: âI wrote âA Day in the Life of Sayed Kashua.â And Iâve been writing it ever since.â"],["p","The second of four brothers, Kashua was a nervous childââscared of everything,â he said. At night, after his parents went to bed, he slipped into his grandmotherâs room, where he heard stories about a bygone time, about âthe fields and the lands and the first rain.â It was from her that he learned how to tell a story, and from her that he found out about âthe damned warâ of 1948, when Israel won independence and more than seven hundred thousand Palestinians became refugees. His grandmother described how a Jewish sniper killed his grandfather as he was picking grapes, leaving her alone with four daughters and a two-month-old son. When the war was over, she wanted to return to the fields. âSo she tries to head out,â Kashua said, âand she sees an Israeli soldier, and he tells her, âThere are no fields.âÂ â"],["p","Bereft of her land, she continued to work in Tira, twenty miles north of Tel Aviv, as a hired field hand. When Kashuaâs father married, he brought his wife to live with his family, across the hill from the village mosque. Today, Tira is an overcrowded city, rife with corruption and gang violence. But when Kashua was growing up the streets were quiet and nameless. On airless summer nights, neighbors slept on their rooftops. His mother taught at the local school; his father, after years of farming, went to work for the interior ministry, issuing passports in a basement office. âSometimes he got so bored that heâd renew all our I.D.s and passports,â Kashua has written. Like other people in the village, his father was active in the Communist Party; children grew up singing Red Army songs. Tira may be the only place on earth where you can meet a man named Abu Castro."],["p","One day, Kashua, rummaging in an old suitcase in his grandmotherâs closet, found a postcard stamped âDamon Prison, Haifa,â and dated 1970. It read, âTell Mother to stop crying. I will be released soon.â Kashua discovered that his father had been held for more than two years in administrative detention, without trial. A dusty clipping from ",["em","Haaretz"]," described his arrest for failing to thwart a bombing in a Hebrew University cafeteria, in 1969, which wounded twenty-nine people. âSome of those involved in the bombing were apparently friends of his,â Kashua said. âBut he never talked about it.â Newspaper reports from the time say that Darwish Kashua, then a student at the university, was held on suspicion of âassistingâ the terrorists, but he was never charged."],["p","After Darwish was released, he named his firstborn son Sam, after the ",["em",{"class":"small"},"SAM"]," missiles that Egypt fired at Israel during the Yom Kippur War. To his mortification, his sons grew up wholly uninterested in politics. (âWe canât even draw a flag,â Kashua writes.) He urged them to excel in school and, above all, to read. âHe thought that Lenin, Trotsky, and Marx were all the literature you needed,â Kashua said. âSo I tried. I read all of that shit.

Outside the building, kids hounded him, chanting, âMuhammad is dead.â The first day, on the bus ride home, a soldier asked to see his identity card. Kashua, who wasnât old enough to get an Israeli I.D., was thrown off the bus. âThatâs when I started to understand what it meant to be Arab,â he said. Sobbing, he called his father. âWhose son are you?â his father said, laughing. âWhen a soldier didnât notice me on the bus I would wave my I.D. and say, âIâm Arab, take me

is a diglossic language, with literary and colloquial versions. Kashua, whose Arabic education ended when he enrolled in the Jerusalem academy, isnât versed in the literary one. The books he learned most deeply were classics of modern Hebrew, and they suggested a world he didnât inhabit. Books by Amos Oz, David Grossman, and Meir Shalev implied that the Hebrew canon was closed to anyone who wasnât a fair-skinned Ashkenazi. When Arabs appeared in their stories, it was usually as a Jewish characterâs foil or negative imageâwhat the Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury has called âa shadow.â"],["p","Kashua likes to say that he fell in love ",["em","in"]," Hebrew, not ",["em","with"]," Hebrew.

But the girlâs mother didnât approve of the relationshipââI donât want my daughter to live in an Arab village,â she told him. After graduation, as Kashuaâs schoolmates left to perform their mandatory Army service, he stayed in Jerusalem and enrolled in university. He was lonely and quickly became depressed. Two events saved him: meeting Najat, a first-year student who also came from Tira, and beginning to report for a weekly paper called ",["em","Kol Haâir"],"."],["p","Kashuaâs first assignment, when he was twenty-one, was to cover an arts festival in Arab East Jerusalem. Kashua told me that he abhorred âany sign of nationalismâ in a cultural context, and so his piece âmade fun of the whole thing.â Yosef Cohen, then the editor of the paper, said, âIn Hebrew media, thereâs a tendency to see Arabs either through the sight of the rifle or as the eternal martyrs. Sayed did neither. He showed Arabs as human beings, with a sense of irony that was quite rare.â"],["p","Kashua decided to remain in Jerusalem and write, but when he told his parents they were devastated. âArt is for Jews,â his mother told him. âMinorities need a profession.â At night, in an unheated studio apartment he shared with Najat, in the Arab neighborhood of Beit Safafa, Kashua started writing a bleak, meandering memoir.

At those meetings, Kashua tried out chapters:"],["blockquote",["p","There are only Arabs in the emergency room.

Najat warned Kashua against publishing a book that portrayed their home town as a petty, claustrophobic place, and that detailed, often in comic and critical terms, such taboos as dishonoring oneâs parents or considering infidelity. âI didnât want to deal with these things,â she recalled. âIt would have been difficult for anyone to share, but especially for us, coming from a society that isâwhat can you doâvery conservative.â One reviewer of the novel, in the Arabic-language newspaper ",["em","Al Ittihad"],", told me that he took issue with Kashuaâs writing âabout his grandmotherâs closet, about her underthings.â Almost immediately, Kashua regretted writing the book."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b63fa7206a168e2d1778d%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63fa7206a168e2d1778d%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b63fa7206a168e2d1778d%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b63fa7206a168e2d1778d"}]],["p","âArab society in Israel suffers from a syndrome of âWhoâs more Arab than whom?âÂ â Ayman Sikseck, a young Arab Israeli novelist who writes in Hebrew, said. âAnd once you coÃ¶perate with the Israeli establishment then youâre supposedly no longer Arab.â The political map points to a precarious reality.

But, according to a 2012 poll by the Israel Democracy Institute, only a quarter of them are willing to have the cities they live in belong to it. Many Arabs, like Kashua, consider themselves both Palestinian and Israeli, a bifurcated identity that speaks to years of strife and longing. âPeople keep bringing up this question of âWould you want to live in a Palestinian state?âÂ â Kashua told me. âIs there a Palestinian state?

As people claw through trash heaps, looking for food, they realize that the tanks are the by-product of a peace agreement; residents are under the jurisdiction of a new Palestinian state.

winter, Kashua got a call from the television producer Danny Paran, asking to meet. Paran, an observant Jew, is an outlier in Israeli show business, whose ranks tend to be secular and left-wing, but he is a respected veteran, and he had been following Kashuaâs newspaper columns. He had an idea for a series that he wanted to market to the Arab world."],["p","âHe took me to some kosher cafÃ©,â Kashua recalled, and âkept fixing his ",["em","kipa"],".â Kashua was fascinated to encounter a Jewish producer who was interested in Arab television, but he found Paranâs idea laughable. Hadnât he heard of the Arab worldâs boycott of Israel? They decided to collaborate on a different concept: a comedy about Jewish-Arab relations. Paran saw it as an antidote to the âheavyâ political dramas that tried to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Kashua envisioned a series closer to home, âabout an Arab who really wants to do everything in order to be accepted as an equal in Israeli societyâbut it doesnât work.â He had another motive, too, he later acknowledged. Although Arab Israelis represent a fifth of the population, in 2011 they made up one per cent of the characters on national TV and, according to a report by the agency that oversees commercial broadcasts in Israel, âusually appear in the context of crime and violence.â Kashua wanted âpeople to get used to seeing Arab actors on prime-time television.â"],["p","Kashua set to work, devising a deceptively modest script that skewered stereotypes among both Jews and Arabs. He said that he wanted each episode to touch on a stigma in Israeli society: âthe whole thing with Arabs and dogs,â âArabs and swimming,â and âArabs and drivingâ (are afraid of, canât, and are bad at, respectively). The script, whose dialogue was mostly in Arabic, to be screened with Hebrew subtitles, addressed the conflict at its most mundane: the measly water pressure in Arab towns, the spotty Internet coverage, the dearth of Arab gardeners following crackdowns. As Yonatan Amir, a friend of Kashuaâs, said, the show helped explain âthe kind of politics that arises from the dirty dishes in the sink.â"],["p","âArab Laborâ centers on Amjad Elian, a sycophantic Arab journalist for a Hebrew newspaper, who lives in an Arab village before moving with his family to a Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem. In the pilot, Amjad is fed up with being pulled over at checkpoints. He blasts Army Radio and puts on his best accent when addressing the soldiers, but nothing helps. Bewildered, he turns to a Jewish colleague, who tells him that the problem is with his car: âA Subaru like yours could belong only to Arabs or young settlers.â He recommends a Land Rover, so Amjad proceeds to buy oneâstolenâfrom a local Arab dealer. The soldiers now wave him through. But Amjadâs father is livid when he hears that his son was seen wearing a seat belt. âSeat belt!â he tells his wife, and makes an effeminate gesture."],["p","Kashua used prejudice like a boomerang: the moment a viewer snickered at a joke, she became its next target. âIâm not sure whom Iâm laughing at, exactly,â he once said. âI think Iâm laughing at Amjad, but maybe Iâm really laughing at Israelis for thinking these things.â Incisive as Kashua was about right-wingers, he was even more unsparing toward the left and its hypocrisies. After a Jewish neighbor mistakes Amjad for the buildingâs new staircase cleaner (âDonât leave a puddle by the door,â she warns), she awkwardly backpedals by announcing her membership in a leftist party: âWe vote Meretz. Just so you know.â"],["p","For more than a year, Paran shopped around Kashuaâs script, but network executives werenât interested. âThe challenge was to bring an Arab-speaking show to mainstream Israel,â Udi Lion, then a director of special programming at Keshet Media Group, said. âEven worldwide this hasnât been done. Thereâs no Turkish-language show in Germany, no Spanish-speaking show on NBC, for example. Not in a foreign language, let alone in the language of the enemy.â"],["p","It didnât help that Kashua was certain the series would fail. âI would throw seventy per cent of âArab Laborâ in the trash,â he told me. He can be exacting on set, and, like many comedy writers, he is riddled with anxiety. âHow should I put this gently,â Ran Telem, an executive at Keshet, said. âYou know those girls in school who always come out of an exam crying and thinking theyâve failed and then they ace it? Thatâs Sayed.â"],["p","In April, 2005, Keshet won a ten-year deal to produce shows for Channel 2, the most widely watched channel on television. The agreement, drafted by a committee of public representatives, had a high-minded purpose: to develop shows made by and about âpreviously disenfranchisedâ sectors of society. By yearâs end, Kashuaâs series had been green-lighted."],["p","âArab Laborâ was an overnight hit. Twenty-five per cent of viewers tuned in for the premiÃ¨re, making it the third-most-watched series on TV. The production felt datedâmisunderstandings spun out of control, set to punchy musicâbut the dialogue was unlike anything else on TV. For the most part, Jewish critics praised the seriesâ",["em","Haaretz"]," called it âeasily the best showâ on Israeli televisionâthough they tended to stress its âimportance,â rather than its entertainment value."],["p","But in the Arab Israeli community the series, even more than Kashuaâs novels, was met with scorn. Some Arab intellectuals said that the show trafficked in the very stereotypes that it was meant to upend. Amal Jamal, a professor of political science at Tel Aviv University, described it as âa fig-leaf show.â Kashua had done as much as he could, he said, but the show didnât go far enough: âIt doesnât present racism as institutionalized, sanctioned, deep, and systemic.â Others attacked Kashua personally. A newspaper affiliated with the Islamist movement called him âa slave to the Jewish masters.â Pamphlets circulated in Tira calling him a âJewish pig.â"],["p","One day in 2007, during the worst of this onslaught, Kashua sat in his parentsâ living room, in Tira, and watched an episode of âArab Labor.â The scene is depicted in the documentary âSayed Kashua: Forever Scared,â by the filmmaker Dorit Zimbalist. âIn todayâs episode, there was ninety per cent Arabicâon prime-time Channel 2!â Kashua tells his parents, sounding embittered. If that didnât register with Arab Israelis, what would? âScrew those Arab sons of bitches,â he mutters."],["p","Reflecting on the criticism and the vilification, he says, âYou hear things like that and say, âFuck, for whose benefit am I carrying this burden?âÂ â At the same time, he wonders whether his Arab critics are right. âDo you know what Iâm fed up with? With this road Iâve taken, slowly and gently, just like this series. I say, âYes, through culture, slowly theyâll understand.â But itâs not true. And Israelis canât take the truth to their faces.â Growing angry, he says, âI suck up to them, and what do I do on Passover? The column for Passover. I have to amuse Jews to be read over the weekend, so they can laugh at the Arab. I want to shout âHappy holidayââbut, you know, really shout it.â He cups a hand over his mouth and bellows, â",["em","Happy holiday!

I visited Kashua in Champaign, where he recently extended his contract with the University of Illinois for three more years, he warned me, âItâs one of the most boring places youâll ever go to.â He insisted on meeting me at the airport, and arrived in a behemoth black Jeep, a booster seat in the back. âDoes it smell like chicken?â he asked as I got in."],["p","We drove through suburban streets to pick up his sons, who are ten and four, from school. His kids are by now trilingual and, unlike their parents, seem happily settled in their new surroundings. They argued over whether their Playmobil came from Target or from Walmart, while their older sisterââthe tallest girl you can imagine,â Kashua saidâwas at basketball practice. At their house, a modest brick-and-clapboard rental, a car with an âObama â08â sticker was parked in the driveway."],["p","Najat, a psychotherapist by training, appears in Israeli public life mostly as a crabbed presence, the object of her husbandâs jokes. (âFor a long time, I thought that depression can breed creativity,â Kashua once said, at a party for a season premiÃ¨re. âShe showed me that so, too, can sexual frustration.â) In person, she was graceful, with a pearly smile and dark hair coiled in a loose bun. She delighted in her kidsâ AmericannessââWait till we tell ",["em","Fletcher!"],"â she mimicked her youngestâand had a calm authority over her husband."],["p","As we sat down, I asked whether the family followed the news from home. âEnough to not want to go back,â Kashua said. That day, someone had spray-painted âDeath to the Arabsâ on the bilingual school that the children had attended. A new government policy briefly forbade Palestinian workers to ride the same buses as Jewish settlers. âPeople say âCome backâjust give it some time,âÂ â he said. âFuck that. Iâm tired of waiting.â Still, in a recent column he had confessed to having an âoverwhelming desire to go back home.â He couldnât rid himself of the notion of the homeland that his father had instilled in him: âHe etched in our brains the fear of leaving the country.â"],["p","During my visit, Kashua attempted, twice, to go to a documentary about Edward Said and once to a lecture on the Middle East. But there was always a child to drop off, a class to prepare for. The socializing he did was confined mostly to Israeli expats, of the sort who read him at home. He was struggling to create a life for himself, as was Najat. âLoneliness isnât the problem,â she explained. âItâs the sense of having to build something new at an age when youâre not exactly ready for something new.â"],["p","Kashuaâs creative life remains in Israel. A series he has written about a depressed comedy writerâhis âLouie,â as some members of the production crew put itâis being edited. His column in ",["em","Haaretz"]," still runs every Friday; he recently described himself scrutinizing dishes on a restaurant menu with his daughter. (âItâs Cajun style,â she tells him. âI donât think youâll like it.â) âA Borrowed Identity,â the movie based on âDancing Arabs,â was released in the U.S. this summer, but the interpretation is wooden, and it didnât play much beyond the festival circuit. Those close to Kashua sense his displacement. His longtime literary agent, Deborah Harris, was baffled by his decision to settle in Champaign, rather than in New York or Boston. âI think he really wanted it to be exile,â she said. âHe wants to be in the most ",["em","parve"]," place in the world.â"],["p","One afternoon, I met Kashua outside the building of the universityâs Jewish-studies department, where he teaches advanced Hebrew. He was smoking next to a notice that said, âThis is a smoke-free campus.â The irony of his situationâa Palestinian writer leaves Israel only to find himself teaching Hebrew to American Jewsâhadnât escaped him. When he was offered the job, he said, he warned the department head that students might adopt his Arabic accent in Hebrew and be âkicked out of Birthright,â the organization that offers Jewish kids free trips to Israel."],["p","Inside, five students chatted around an oblong table, and a framed photograph on the wall showed a young woman holding a sign that read, âI am not a self-hating Jew.â Kashua is an uncertain, even timid teacher. In Hebrew, he asked the students to hand in homework at the end of class, then immediately demurred: âI donât know. Do you want to?â Still, he bantered easily with them. When he asked them to translate âinsertâ and got a few snickers, he smiled and scolded them: âOnly the shit words you understand.â Grammar bored him, but he loosened up a little as the students began reading a Hebrew translation of Italo Calvinoâs âAdventure of Two Spouses,â struggling through language far too intricately shaded for them to manage.

But, as we sat, the resolution receded. Over Green Line beer, he spoke of his father, of his family in Tira, of Jerusalem."],["p","It had been a difficult spring. Kashuaâs father had been given a diagnosis of lung cancer, and died less than a month later. âSomething screwed up in my head,â Kashua said. The Israeli elections, in March, had been cause for guarded optimism at first. Watching from afar, he had written in ",["em","Haaretz"]," that Odeh had âmanaged to instill some faith in me.â The Joint List did better than expectedâbecoming the third-largest party in parliamentâbut the election was most notable for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs attempts to court far-right votes. During the campaign, Netanyahu announced that he would not permit a Palestinian stateââItâs Us or Themâ was his sloganâand warned ominously of Arabs âcoming out in droves to the polls.â The rhetoric attracted nationalist voters, who helped to secure him a fourth term in office."],["p","More recently, Jewish extremists firebombed a house in the West Bank village of Duma, killing an eighteen-month-old Palestinian boy and his father. Several incidents followed, in which Palestinians stabbed Israelis in the street, raising fears of a third Palestinian uprising. Kashua wrote mournfully in ",["em","Haaretz"]," about searching Google Earth for the torched house in Duma, and then for his parentsâ home, in Tira: âI try clicking on the arrow to move myself a little closer. Just a tiny bit more, and Iâm inside the house.â"],["p","In the bar, Kashua considered the distance between him and his old home. Despite pressure from Keshet, he has refused to write a fifth season of âArab Labor.â He told me, âI couldnât do humor anymore.â He was under contract for a new novelâabout a journalist who sets out to write his fatherâs story while living in a small university townâbut he hadnât started. âI used to go to a bar, look at the kitchen, and see two Arab workers, or even Africans. I could be accurate; I could describe them. Here, I go, I look, I donât know what I see.â"],["p","Mostly, he talked about his children, and his fear that they would grow up to resent him. âFor confusing them,â he explained. âFor the fact that they will have nowhere to be. Not there and not there and not here.â He once told his parents that, despite the hostility, he loved their home town more than anything else in the world. In the bar, he asked, âWhat kind of Tira do my kids have?â He seemed to weigh the question. âI wanted a more comfortable life for them. But you canât raise children in Israel on values of full equality. Arab children, I mean. Jewish children maybe you can lie to. But when my children find out theyâre not equal where will they go?âÂ â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/an-exile-in-the-corn-belt","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e31562bc86f2c9a244e4e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Amos

there is one thing most Americans have been able to agree on over the years, it is that getting an education, particularly a college education, is a key to human betterment and prosperity. The consensus dates back at least to 1636, when the legislature of the Massachusetts Bay Colony established Harvard College as Americaâs first institution of higher learning. It extended through the establishment of âland-grant collegesâ during and after the Civil War, the passage of the G.I. Bill during the Second World War, the expansion of federal funding for higher education during the Great Society era, and President Obamaâs efforts to make college more affordable. Already, the cost of higher education has become a big issue in the 2016 Presidential campaign. Three Democratic candidatesâHillary Clinton, Martin OâMalley, and Bernie Sandersâhave offered plans to reform the student-loan program and make college more accessible."],["p","Promoters of higher education have long emphasized its role in meeting civic needs. The Puritans who established Harvard were concerned about a shortage of clergy; during the Progressive Era, John Dewey insisted that a proper education would make people better citizens, with enlarged moral imaginations. Recently, as wage stagnation and rising inequality have emerged as serious problems, the economic arguments for higher education have come to the fore. âEarning a post-secondary degree or credential is no longer just a pathway to opportunity for a talented few,â the White House Web site states. âRather, it is a prerequisite for the growing jobs of the new economy.â Commentators and academic economists have claimed that college doesnât merely help individuals get higher-paying jobs; it raises wages throughout the economy and helps ameliorate rising inequality. In an influential 2008 book, âThe Race Between Education and Technology,â the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued that technological progress has dramatically increased the demand for skilled workers, and that, in recent decades, the American educational system has failed to meet the challenge by supplying enough graduates who can carry out the tasks that a high-tech economy requires. âNot so long ago, the American economy grew rapidly and wages grew in tandem, with education playing a large, positive role in both,â they wrote in a subsequent paper. âThe challenge now is to revitalize education-based mobility.â"],["p","The âmessage from the media, from the business community, and even from many parts of the government has been that a college degree is more important than ever in order to have a good career,â Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at Wharton, notes in his informative and refreshingly skeptical new book, âWill College Pay Off?â (PublicAffairs). âAs a result, families feel even more pressure to send their kids to college. This is at a time when more families find those costs to be a serious burden.â During recent decades, tuition and other charges have risen sharplyâmany colleges charge more than fifty thousand dollars a year in tuition and fees. Even if you factor in the expansion of financial aid, Cappelli reports, âstudents in the United States pay about four times more than their peers in countries elsewhere.â"],["p","Despite the increasing costsâand the claims about a shortage of college graduatesâthe number of people attending and graduating from four-year educational institutions keeps going up. In the 2000-01 academic year, American colleges awarded almost 1.3 million bachelorâs degrees. A decade later, the figure had jumped nearly forty per cent, to more than 1.7 million. About seventy per cent of all high-school graduates now go on to college, and half of all Americans between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-four have a college degree. Thatâs a big change. In 1980, only one in six Americans twenty-five and older were college graduates. Fifty years ago, it was fewer than one in ten. To cater to all the new students, colleges keep expanding and adding courses, many of them vocationally inclined. At Kansas State, undergraduates can major in Bakery Science and Management or Wildlife and Outdoor Enterprise Management. They can minor in Unmanned Aircraft Systems or Pet Food Science. Oklahoma State offers a degree in Fire Protection and Safety Engineering and Technology. At Utica College, you can major in Economic Crime Detection."],["p","In the fast-growing for-profit college sector, which now accounts for more than ten per cent of all students, vocational degrees are the norm. DeVry Universityâwhich last year taught more than sixty thousand students, at more than seventy-five campusesâoffers majors in everything from multimedia design and development to health-care administration. On its Web site, DeVry boasts, âIn 2013, 90% of DeVry University associate and bachelorâs degree grads actively seeking employment had careers in their field within six months of graduation.â That sounds impressiveâuntil you notice that the figure includes those graduates who had jobs in their field before graduation. (Many DeVry students are working adults who attend college part-time to further their careers.) Nor is the phrase âin their fieldâ clearly defined. âWould you be okay rolling the dice on a degree in communications based on information like that?â Cappelli writes. He notes that research by the nonprofit National Association of Colleges and Employers found that, in the same year, just 6.5 per cent of graduates with communications degrees were offered jobs in the field.

is certainly true that college has been life changing for most people and a tremendous financial investment for many of them,â Cappelli writes. âIt is also true that for some people, it has been financially crippling.Â .Â .Â .The world of college education is different now than it was a generation ago, when many of the people driving policy decisions on education went to college, and the theoretical ideas about why college should pay off do not comport well with the reality.â"],["p","No idea has had more influence on education policy than the notion that colleges teach their students specific, marketable skills, which they can use to get a good job. Economists refer to this as the âhuman capitalâ theory of education, and for the past twenty or thirty years it has gone largely unchallenged. If youâve completed a two-year associateâs degree, youâve got more âhuman capitalâ than a high-school graduate. And if youâve completed a four-year bachelorâs degree youâve got more âhuman capitalâ than someone who attended a community college. Once you enter the labor market, the theory says, you will be rewarded with a better job, brighter career prospects, and higher wages."],["p","Thereâs no doubt that college graduates earn more money, on average, than people who donât have a degree. And for many years the so-called âcollege wage premiumâ grew. In 1970, according to a recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, people with a bachelorâs degree earned about sixty thousand dollars a year, on average, and people with a high-school diploma earned about forty-five thousand dollars. Thirty-five years later, in 2005, the average earnings of college graduates had risen to more than seventy thousand dollars, while high-school graduates had seen their earnings fall slightly. (All these figures are inflation-adjusted.) The fact that the college wage premium went up at a time when the supply of graduates was expanding significantly seemed to confirm the Goldin-Katz theory that technological change was creating an ever-increasing demand for workers with a lot of human capital."],["p","During the past decade or so, however, a number of things have happened that donât easily mesh with that theory. If college graduates remain in short supply, their wages should still be rising. But they arenât. In 2001, according to the Economic Policy Institute",["a",{"href":"/#editorsnote"},"*"],", a liberal think tank in Washington, workers with undergraduate degrees (but not graduate degrees) earned, on average, $30.05 an hour; last year, they earned $29.55 an hour. Other sources show even more dramatic falls. âBetween 2001 and 2013, the average wage of workers with a bachelorâs degree declined 10.3 percent, and the average wage of those with an associateâs degree declined 11.1 percent,â the New York Fed reported in its study. Wages have been falling most steeply of all among newly minted college graduates. And jobless rates have been rising. In 2007, 5.5 per cent of college graduates under the age of twenty-five were out of work. Today, the figure is close to nine per cent. If getting a bachelorâs degree is meant to guarantee entry to an arena in which jobs are plentiful and wages rise steadily, the education system has been failing for some time."],["p","And, while college graduates are still doing a lot better than nongraduates, some studies show that the earnings gap has stopped growing. The figures need careful parsing. If you lump college graduates in with people with advanced degrees, the picture looks brighter. But almost all the recent gains have gone to folks with graduate degrees. âThe four-year-degree premium has remained flat over the past decade,â the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported. And one of the main reasons it went up in the first place wasnât that college graduates were enjoying significantly higher wages. It was that the earnings of nongraduates were falling."],["p","Many students and their families extend themselves to pay for a college education out of fear of falling into the low-wage economy. Thatâs perfectly understandable. But how sound an investment is it? One way to figure this out is to treat a college degree like a stock or a bond and compare the cost of obtaining one with the accumulated returns that it generates over the years. (In this case, the returns come in the form of wages over and above those earned by people who donât hold degrees.) When the research firm PayScale did this a few years ago, it found that the average inflation-adjusted return on a college education is about seven per cent, which is a bit lower than the historical rate of return on the stock market. Cappelli cites this study along with one from the Hamilton Project, a Washington-based research group that came up with a much higher figureâabout fifteen per centâbut by assuming, for example, that all college students graduate in four years. (In fact, the four-year graduation rate for full-time, first-degree students is less than forty per cent, and the six-year graduation rate is less than sixty per cent.)"],["p","These types of studies, and there are lots of them, usually find that the financial benefits of getting a college degree are much larger than the financial costs. But Cappelli points out that for parents and students the average figures may not mean much, because they disguise enormous differences in outcomes from school to school. He cites a survey, carried out by PayScale for ",["em","Businessweek"]," in 2012, that showed that students who attend M.I.T., Caltech, and Harvey Mudd College enjoy an annual return of more than ten per cent on their âinvestment.â But the survey also found almost two hundred colleges where students, on average, never fully recouped the costs of their education. âThe big news about the payoff from college should be the incredible variation in it across colleges,â Cappelli writes. âLooking at the actual return on the costs of attending college, careful analyses suggest that the payoff from many college programsâas much as one in fourâis actually ",["em","negative"],".

what purpose does college really serve for students and employers? Before the human-capital theory became so popular, there was another view of higher educationâas, in part, a filter, or screening device, that sorted individuals according to their aptitudes and conveyed this information to businesses and other hiring institutions. By completing a four-year degree, students could signal to potential employers that they had a certain level of cognitive competence and could carry out assigned tasks and work in a group setting. But a college education didnât necessarily imbue students with specific work skills that employers needed, or make them more productive."],["p","Kenneth Arrow, one of the giants of twentieth-century economics, came up with this account, and if you take it seriously you canât assume that itâs always a good thing to persuade more people to go to college. If almost everybody has a college degree, getting one doesnât differentiate you from the pack. To get the job you want, you might have to go to a fancy (and expensive) college, or get a higher degree. Education turns into an arms race, which primarily benefits the arms manufacturersâin this case, colleges and universities."],["p","The screening model isnât very fashionable these days, partly because it seems perverse to suggest that education doesnât boost productivity. But thereâs quite a bit of evidence that seems to support Arrowâs theory. In recent years, more jobs have come to demand a college degree as an entry requirement, even though the demands of the jobs havenât changed much. Some nursing positions are on the list, along with jobs for executive secretaries, salespeople, and distribution managers. According to one study, just twenty per cent of executive assistants and insurance-claims clerks have college degrees but more than forty-five per cent of the job openings in the field require one. âThis suggests that employers may be relying on a B.A. as a broad recruitment filter that may or may not correspond to specific capabilities needed to do the job,â the study concluded."],["p","It is well established that students who go to Ã©lite colleges tend to earn more than graduates of less selective institutions. But is this because Harvard and Princeton do a better job of teaching valuable skills than other places, or because employers believe that they get more talented students to begin with? An exercise carried out by Lauren Rivera, of the Kellogg School of Management, at Northwestern, strongly suggests that itâs the latter. Rivera interviewed more than a hundred recruiters from investment banks, law firms, and management consulting firms, and she found that they recruited almost exclusively from the very top-ranked schools, and simply ignored most other applicants. The recruiters didnât pay much attention to things like grades and majors. âIt was not the content of education that elite employers valued but rather its prestige,â Rivera concluded."],["p","If higher education serves primarily as a sorting mechanism, that might help explain another disturbing development: the tendency of many college graduates to take jobs that donât require college degrees. Practically everyone seems to know a well-educated young person who is working in a bar or a mundane clerical job, because he or she canât find anything better. Doubtless, the Great Recession and its aftermath are partly to blame. But something deeper, and more lasting, also seems to be happening."],["p","In the Goldin-Katz view of things, technological progress generates an ever-increasing need for highly educated, highly skilled workers. But, beginning in about 2000, for reasons that are still not fully understood, the pace of job creation in high-paying, highly skilled fields slowed significantly. To demonstrate this, three Canadian economists, Paul Beaudry, David A. Green, and Benjamin M. Sand, divided the U.S. workforce into a hundred occupations, ranked by their average wages, and looked at how employment has changed in each category. Since 2000, the economists showed, the demand for highly educated workers declined, while job growth in low-paying occupations increased strongly. âHigh-skilled workers have moved down the occupational ladder and have begun to perform jobs traditionally performed by lower-skilled workers,â they concluded, thus âpushing low-skilled workers even further down the occupational ladder.â"],["p","Increasingly, the competition for jobs is taking place in areas of the labor market where college graduates didnât previously tend to compete. As Beaudry, Green, and Sand put it, âhaving a B.A. is less about obtaining access to high paying managerial and technology jobs and more about beating out less educated workers for the Barista or clerical job.â Even many graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematicsâthe so-called ",["em",{"class":"small"},"STEM"]," subjects, which receive so much official encouragementâare having a tough time getting the jobs theyâd like.

is this happening? The short answer is that nobody knows for sure. One theory is that corporate cost-cutting, having thinned the ranks of workers on the factory floor and in routine office jobs, is now targeting supervisors, managers, and other highly educated people. Another theory is that technological progress, after favoring highly educated workers for a long time, is now turning on them. With rapid advances in processing power, data analysis, voice recognition, and other forms of artificial intelligence, computers can perform tasks that were previously carried out by college graduates, such as analyzing trends, translating foreign-language documents, and filing tax returns. In âThe Second Machine Ageâ (Norton), the M.I.T. professors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee sketch a future where computers will start replacing doctors, lawyers, and many other highly educated professionals. âAs digital labor becomes more pervasive, capable, and powerful,â they write, âcompanies will be increasingly unwilling to pay people wages that theyâll accept, and that will allow them to maintain the standard of living to which theyâve been accustomed.â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b63e81f743c6ee49a534a%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63e81f743c6ee49a534a%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b63e81f743c6ee49a534a%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b63e81f743c6ee49a534a"}]],["p","Cappelli stresses the change in corporate hiring patterns. In the old days, Fortune 500 companies such as General Motors, Citigroup, and I.B.M. took on large numbers of college graduates and trained them for a lifetime at the company. But corporations now invest less in education and training, and, instead of promoting someone, or finding someone in the company to fill a specialized role, they tend to hire from outside. Grooming the next generation of leadership is much less of a concern. âWhat employers want from college graduates now is the same thing they want from applicants who have been out of school for years, and that is job skills and the ability to contribute now,â Cappelli writes. âThat change is fundamental, and it is the reason that getting a good job out of college is now such a challenge.â"],["p","Obtaining a vocational degree or certificate is one strategy that many students employ to make themselves attractive to employers, and, on the face of it, this seems sensible. If youâd like to be a radiology technician, shouldnât you get a B.A. in radiology? If you want to run a bakery, why not apply to Kansas State and sign up for that major in Bakery Science? But narrowly focussed degrees are risky. âIf you graduate in a year when gambling is up and the casinos like your casino management degree, you probably have hit it big,â Cappelli writes. âIf they arenât hiring when you graduate, you may be even worse off getting a first job with that degree anywhere else precisely because it was so tuned to that group of employers.â During the dot-com era, enrollment in computer-science and information-technology programs rose sharply. After the bursting of the stock-market bubble, many of these graduates couldnât find work. âEmployers who say that we need more engineers or IT grads are not promising to hire them when they graduate in four years,â Cappelli notes. âPushing kids into a field like health care because someone believes there is a need there now will not guarantee that they all get jobs and, if they do, that those jobs will be as good as workers in that field have now.â"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3ESo%20what%E2%80%99s%20the%20solution%3F%20Some%20people%20believe%20that%20online%20learning%20will%20provide%20a%20viable%20low-cost%20alternative%20to%20a%20live-in%20college%20education.%20Bernie%20Sanders%20would%20get%20rid%20of%20tuition%20fees%20at%20public%20universities%2C%20raising%20some%20of%20the%20funds%20with%20a%20new%20tax%20on%20financial%20transactions.%20Clinton%20and%20O%E2%80%99Malley%20would%20also%20expand%20federal%20support%20for%20state%20universities%2C%20coupling%20this%20funding%20with%20lower%20interest%20rates%20on%20student%20loans%20and%20incentives%20for%20colleges%20to%20hold%20down%20costs.%20Another%20approach%20is%20to%20direct%20more%20students%20and%20resources%20to%20two-year%20community%20colleges%20and%20other%20educational%20institutions%20that%20cost%20less%20than%20four-year%20colleges.%20President%20Obama%20recently%20called%20for%20all%20qualified%20high-school%20students%20to%20be%20guaranteed%20a%20place%20in%20community%20college%2C%20and%20for%20tuition%20fees%20to%20be%20eliminated.%20Such%20policies%20would%20reverse%20recent%20history.%20In%20a%20new%20book%2C%20%E2%80%9CLearning%20by%20Doing%3A%20The%20Real%20Connection%20between%20Innovation%2C%20Wages%2C%20and%20Wealth%E2%80%9D%20(Yale)%2C%20James%20Bessen%2C%20a%20technology%20entrepreneur%20who%20also%20teaches%20at%20Boston%20University%20School%20of%20Law%2C%20points%20out%20that%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20policy%20trend%20over%20the%20last%20decade%20has%20been%20to%20starve%20community%20colleges%20in%20order%20to%20feed%20four-year%20colleges%2C%20especially%20private%20research%20universities.%E2%80%9D%20Some%20of%20the%20discrepancies%20are%20glaring.%20Richard%20Vedder%2C%20who%20teaches%20economics%20at%20Ohio%20University%2C%20calculated%20that%20in%202010%20Princeton%2C%20which%20had%20an%20endowment%20of%20close%20to%20fifteen%20billion%20dollars%2C%20received%20state%20and%20federal%20benefits%20equivalent%20to%20roughly%20fifty%20thousand%20dollars%20per%20student%2C%20whereas%20the%20nearby%20College%20of%20New%20Jersey%20got%20benefits%20of%20just%20two%20thousand%20dollars%20per%20student.%20There%20are%20sound%20reasons%20for%20rewarding%20excellence%20and%20sponsoring%20institutions%20that%20do%20important%20scientific%20research.%20But%20is%20a%20twenty-five-to-one%20difference%20in%20government%20support%20really%20justified%3F%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EPerhaps%20the%20strongest%20argument%20for%20caring%20about%20higher%20education%20is%20that%20it%20can%20increase%20social%20mobility%2C%20regardless%20of%20whether%20the%20human-capital%20theory%20or%20the%20signalling%20theory%20is%20correct.%20A%20recent%20study%20by%20researchers%20at%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20San%20Francisco%20showed%20that%20children%20who%20are%20born%20into%20households%20in%20the%20poorest%20fifth%20of%20the%20income%20distribution%20are%20six%20times%20as%20likely%20to%20reach%20the%20top%20fifth%20if%20they%20graduate%20from%20college.%20Providing%20access%20to%20college%20for%20more%20kids%20from%20deprived%20backgrounds%20helps%20nurture%20talents%20that%20might%20otherwise%20go%20to%20waste%2C%20and%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20right%20thing%20to%20do.%20(Of%20course%2C%20if%20college%20attendance%20were%20practically%20universal%2C%20having%20a%20degree%20would%20send%20a%20weaker%20signal%20to%20employers.)%20But%20increasing%20the%20number%20of%20graduates%20seems%20unlikely%20to%20reverse%20the%20over-all%20decline%20of%20high-paying%20jobs%2C%20and%20it%20won%E2%80%99t%20resolve%20the%20income-inequality%20problem%2C%20either.%20As%20the%20economist%20Lawrence%20Summers%20and%20two%20colleagues%20showed%20in%20a%20recent%20simulation%2C%20even%20if%20we%20magically%20summoned%20up%20college%20degrees%20for%20a%20tenth%20of%20all%20the%20working-age%20American%20men%20who%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20them%E2%80%94by%20historical%20standards%2C%20a%20big%20boost%20in%20college-graduation%20rates%E2%80%94we%E2%80%99d%20scarcely%20change%20the%20existing%20concentration%20of%20income%20at%20the%20very%20top%20of%20the%20earnings%20distribution%2C%20where%20C.E.O.s%20and%20hedge-fund%20managers%20live.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBeing%20more%20realistic%20about%20the%20role%20that%20college%20degrees%20play%20would%20help%20families%20and%20politicians%20make%20better%20choices.%20It%20could%20also%20help%20us%20appreciate%20the%20actual%20merits%20of%20a%20traditional%20broad-based%20education%2C%20often%20called%20a%20liberal-arts%20education%2C%20rather%20than%20trying%20to%20reduce%20everything%20to%20an%20economic%20cost-benefit%20analysis.%20%E2%80%9CTo%20be%20clear%2C%20the%20idea%20is%20not%20that%20there%20will%20be%20a%20big%20financial%20payoff%20to%20a%20liberal%20arts%20degree%2C%E2%80%9D%20Cappelli%20writes.%20%E2%80%9CIt%20is%20that%20there%20is%20no%20guarantee%20of%20a%20payoff%20from%20very%

whatâs the solution? Some people believe that online learning will provide a viable low-cost alternative to a live-in college education. Bernie Sanders would get rid of tuition fees at public universities, raising some of the funds with a new tax on financial transactions. Clinton and OâMalley would also expand federal support for state universities, coupling this funding with lower interest rates on student loans and incentives for colleges to hold down costs. Another approach is to direct more students and resources to two-year community colleges and other educational institutions that cost less than four-year colleges. President Obama recently called for all qualified high-school students to be guaranteed a place in community college, and for tuition fees to be eliminated. Such policies would reverse recent history. In a new book, âLearning by Doing: The Real Connection between Innovation, Wages, and Wealthâ (Yale), James Bessen, a technology entrepreneur who also teaches at Boston University School of Law, points out that âthe policy trend over the last decade has been to starve community colleges in order to feed four-year colleges, especially private research universities.â Some of the discrepancies are glaring. Richard Vedder, who teaches economics at Ohio University, calculated that in 2010 Princeton, which had an endowment of close to fifteen billion dollars, received state and federal benefits equivalent to roughly fifty thousand dollars per student, whereas the nearby College of New Jersey got benefits of just two thousand dollars per student. There are sound reasons for rewarding excellence and sponsoring institutions that do important scientific research. But is a twenty-five-to-one difference in government support really justified?"],["p","Perhaps the strongest argument for caring about higher education is that it can increase social mobility, regardless of whether the human-capital theory or the signalling theory is correct. A recent study by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco showed that children who are born into households in the poorest fifth of the income distribution are six times as likely to reach the top fifth if they graduate from college. Providing access to college for more kids from deprived backgrounds helps nurture talents that might otherwise go to waste, and itâs the right thing to do. (Of course, if college attendance were practically universal, having a degree would send a weaker signal to employers.) But increasing the number of graduates seems unlikely to reverse the over-all decline of high-paying jobs, and it wonât resolve the income-inequality problem, either. As the economist Lawrence Summers and two colleagues showed in a recent simulation, even if we magically summoned up college degrees for a tenth of all the working-age American men who donât have themâby historical standards, a big boost in college-graduation ratesâweâd scarcely change the existing concentration of income at the very top of the earnings distribution, where C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers live."],["p","Being more realistic about the role that college degrees play would help families and politicians make better choices. It could also help us appreciate the actual merits of a traditional broad-based education, often called a liberal-arts education, rather than trying to reduce everything to an economic cost-benefit analysis. âTo be clear, the idea is not that there will be a big financial payoff to a liberal arts degree,â Cappelli writes. âIt is that there is no guarantee of a payoff from very practical, work-based degrees either, yet that is all those degrees promise. For liberal arts, the claim is different and seems more accurate, that it will enrich your life and provide lessons that extend beyond any individual job. There are centuries of experience providing support for that notion.âÂ â¦"],["p",["a",{"href":"/#correctionasterisk"},"*"],"An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the Economic Policy Institute."]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/college-calculus","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1d647e716b454591ae8f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Colleges","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"colleges"},{"id":"5c2e1ee42bc86f2c9a244be8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Higher Education","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"higher-education"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592e2a57980e951c27678628","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-critic-at-large"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"A Critic at Large","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"a-critic-at-large"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Books","url":"/tag/books"},{"name":"Colleges","url":"/tag/colleges"},{"name":"Higher Education","url":"/tag/higher-education"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"John Cassidy","type":"author","title":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.

stock market is not the economy. Thatâs a simple financial truth, but itâs hard to keep in mind in the midst of a sell-off like the one we saw last Monday, especially with headlines screaming about a â",["em",{"class":"small"},"Bloodbath in Global Markets"],".â So, even as the market rallied last week, concerns lingered over the possibility that the sharp decline in stock prices boded ill for the U.S. economy as a whole, giving us front-page stories fretting about the âreal threat to the American economyâ and warning of âa leaner era ahead.â These worries are almost certainly unfounded. The market sell-off in the U.S. wasnât just a matter of panicâit reflected investorsâ genuine anxieties about the future. But those anxieties have surprisingly little to do with the current state of the American economy."],["p","The sell-off was driven mainly by the turmoil in China, which is dealing with the precipitous deflation of a stock-market bubble and is struggling to maintain its economic growth. This has led many to believe that China will grow more slowly than anticipated, while Chinese leadersâ sometimes ham-fisted policy moves in recent months have raised questions about their ability to manage the economy. Given how much we hear about Chinaâs economic importance, you might think that these problems would have a big impact on the U.S. They wonât. In fact, total U.S. exports to China are just a hundred and sixty-five billion dollars, less than one per cent of G.D.P. There are certainly firmsâincluding commodity producers, microchip makers, and fast-food companiesâfor which China is a huge market today. But for most firms the prospect of selling billions of products to Chinese consumers remains more of a promise than a reality. Goldman Sachs, for instance, estimates that just two per cent of the S.Â &Â P. 500âs revenues come from sales to China."],["p","So, while a significant economic downturn in China would squeeze Apple, Yum! Brands (e.g., Pizza Hut), and Iowa farmers, most Americans, and most American companies, would barely notice it, at least in the short term. (Goldman Sachs estimates that a one-per-cent drop in Chinaâs growth rate translates into a mere 0.06-per-cent drop in the United Statesâs G.D.P.) And the flow of goods we import from China is unlikely to be affected by the downturn at all."],["p","Globally, Chinaâs slowing pace of growth has certainly had spillover effects. In the past decade, its boom has created a voracious appetite for commodities of all kinds, from iron ore and copper to oil. As growth there has slowed, the price of these commodities has fallen, and the price of oil has been pushed down further by a production glut. This has been bad for energy and mining stocks, and itâs been very hard on developing economies, like those in Latin America, which relied on commodity exports to China. But for the U.S. economy cheaper commodities are a good thing, putting more money in consumersâ pockets and lowering production costs for American firms."],["p","Some pundits worry that all this market turmoil could presage something like the meltdown of 2007-09 or the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. Yet those were ultimately severe insolvency crises, involving enormous piles of debt that were not going to be repaid, companies and countries going bust, and economies that were deep in recession. The situation today isnât analogous. Unlike the Asian countries that got in trouble in the late nineteen-nineties, China is a creditor to the rest of the world, not a debtor. It has plenty of debt troublesâthanks to enormous overborrowing by corporations and local governmentsâbut those are largely internal issues, unlikely to go global. As for the struggling emerging-market economies, they, too, are in much better shape than they were in the late nineties. Nowadays, these countries typically have sizable dollar reserves and, instead of running big current-account deficits, are mostly running surpluses with the rest of the world. So the ingredients for a full-blown financial crisis donât seem to be in place."],["p","This doesnât mean that the stock-market correction was irrational. It reflected concerns about the long-term future, particularly when it comes to China. China isnât hugely important to U.S. companies or exporters today. But the expectation has been that it will become so, before long. Now investors are wondering if the scenario of a billion consumers happily carrying iPhones will take a lot longer to arrive. And there are similar concerns about emerging markets in general. As the level of uncertainty among investors rises, their tolerance for risk falls, which means theyâll pay less for risky assets, and so stock prices go down."],["p","To say that the stock market isnât the economy doesnât mean that stock-market crises canât become contagious; they can dampen what Keynes called the âanimal spiritsâ of managers and consumers, leading them to cut back on investment and spending. Stock prices do have some impact on consumer spending (the richer consumers feel, the more willing they are to spend). Still, market moves need to be severe and long-lasting to make a real difference. The 1987 crash, for instance, saw stocks drop more than twenty-two per cent in a single day. Yet it had no measurable impact on corporate investment, and only a short-lived effect on consumer spending. Americansâ 401(k)s are a bit lighter than they were two weeks ago. Americaâs economy looks pretty much the same.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/drop-in-the-bucket","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ca436cecf4019214219","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Apple","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"apple"},{"id":"5c2e1d7b7e716b454591aea5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"category_business","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"category-business"},{"id":"5c2e1c8222d4972cd5b8329e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"China","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"china"},{"id":"5c2e1d7ae56e652c90274798","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Corrections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"corrections"},{"id":"5c2e28bd0534ce2cb4c5618c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Exports","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"exports"},{"id":"5c2e1ed836cecf4019214403","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Global Economy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"global-economy"},{"id":"5c2e21cc36cecf401921455a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Stock Markets","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"stock-markets"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a11d32179605b11ad99e0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a11d32179605b11ad99e0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Financial Page","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-financial-page"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Financial Page","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-financial-page"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Apple","url":"/tag/apple"},{"name":"category_business","url":"/tag/category-business"},{"name":"China","url":"/tag/china"},{"name":"Corrections","url":"/tag/corrections"},{"name":"Exports","url":"/tag/exports"},{"name":"Global Economy","url":"/tag/global-economy"},{"name":"Stock Markets","url":"/tag/stock-markets"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"James Surowiecki","type":"author","title":"James Surowiecki is the author of â\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Crowds-James-Surowiecki/dp/0385721706\">The Wisdom of Crowds\u003c/a>.â","email":"","bio":["div",["p","James Surowiecki wrote ",["em","The New Yorkerâs"]," Financial Page column from 2000 to 2017.Â HeÂ came to ",["em","The New Yorker"]," from Slate, where he wrote the Moneybox column.

room for avant-garde performance that John Zorn established on Avenue C in 2005, it would be the guitar, which has inspired expert practitioners across the classical, jazz, folk, rock, and experimental-music genres. September is a great month to hear three of the best of them, in an array of concerts which reveals Zornâs light but lasting control over the venueâs programming."],["p","The young American guitarists Gyan Riley and Julian Lage represent, between them, a broad range of interests: Riley, a son of the legendary composer Terry Riley, has deep roots in the classical and contemporary realms, while Lage, who produces silken sounds with effortless ease, is a master of both jazz and folk idioms. Their upcoming collaboration (on Sept. 6), however, is the latest iteration of âJohn Zornâs Bagatelles,â a series in which a varied group of musicians interpret selections from a new collection of some three hundred miniature works by Zorn. Riley will be playing on nylon strings, Lage on (acoustic) steel strings, and each loves to improvise."],["p","The Italian virtuoso Marco Cappelli, who has taught at Columbia for several years, will enjoy a full residency at the Stone (Sept. 8-13). His concerts cover an astonishingly broad range of musical material and mood. One will combine the lute songs of Dowland with the postwar guitar music of Henze (which, according to Cappelli, share a questing, avant-garde spirit); another offers a radical reinterpretation (with the jazz-experimental vocalist Rosalie Kaplan) of Brittenâs âSongs from the Chinese,â with Cappelli using a different guitar on each of the six songs; and Cappelliâs group Italian Surf Academy will have fun with tunes from the soundtracks of films by Sergio Leone and Mario Bava. The tone turns serious in a musical realization of Art Spiegelmanâs 9/11 graphic elegy âIn the Shadow of No Towers,â a collaboration that features projections by the visual designer Maria Isabel Gouverneur and the video artist Anne Rothschild, with narration by the actor John Turturro.Â â¦"]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/get-stoned","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592f0b34af8ac079aa7ac3c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592f0b34af8ac079aa7ac3c7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Classical

a bitterly cold night in February, William Bratton, New York Cityâs police commissioner, joined several hundred uniformed officers for an informal memorial service at the corner of 107th Avenue and Inwood Street, in Jamaica, Queens. It was past midnight, and everyone was waiting for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was due to speak. Twenty-seven years earlier, on February 26, 1988, a twenty-two-year-old officer named Edward Byrne was shot and killed on that corner, on orders from a drug dealer, as he sat in his patrol car guarding the home of a witness. The memorial is an annual rite for many city cops, and is a reminder of how much tougher New Yorkâs streets were at the time of the murder. That year, there were eighteen hundred and ninety-six homicides in the city, many of them drug-related. In 2014, there were three hundred and twenty-eight, a record low. Byrneâs death drew national headlines, and President Reagan phoned the Byrne family to offer his condolences."],["p","Before the service, the Mayorâs staff worried privately about how the officers would greet him. Under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, the use of stop-and-friskâin which officers stop, question, and pat down someone if there is a âreasonable suspicionâ that a crime has occurred or might occurâbecame more frequent, and minority leaders were speaking out against the aggressive tactics of the N.Y.P.D. De Blasio, while campaigning for mayor, had called for more civilian oversight of the police, and vowed to crack down on âdiscriminatoryâ police practices. The comment did not sit well with many cops. âHe ran an anti-police campaign,â Kelly told me recently. âHe parsed the electorate. He did it very skillfully. He aimed at the fringes.â"],["p","In appointing Bratton, de Blasio hoped to reassure both the public and the police. Bratton, who is sixty-seven, served as New Yorkâs police commissioner from 1994 to 1996, under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and oversaw a sharp reduction in crime. From 2002 to 2009, when he was the chief of police in Los Angeles, violent crime there fell by fifty-four per cent. Bratton embraced both stop-and-frisk and broken-windows policing, the latter a strategy based on the idea, proposed in 1982 by the sociologists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, that cracking down on âquality of lifeâ crimes and disorderly behaviorâturnstile-jumping, squeegee men, public intoxication, aggressive panhandlingâmakes citizens feel safer and discourages more serious crime. In 2009, a Los Angeles ",["em","Times"]," poll showed that eight of ten voters, including seventy-six per cent of Latinos and sixty-eight per cent of blacks, approved of the L.A.P.D.âs performance."],["p","Upon returning to New York, Bratton confronted a police force that had serious issues. A survey of seventeen thousand city residents, ordered by Bratton and conducted in May and June of 2014, found that forty-one per cent of blacks and thirty-one per cent of Hispanics held a somewhat negative or very negative view of the police, compared with just seventeen per cent of whites. A second survey, involving a third of the cityâs force of thirty-five thousand officers, revealed that seventy per cent of them lacked confidence that their decisions âwould be backed by the department.â Three-quarters of white cops said that they expected fair treatment from their supervisors, but only a third of black officers and half of Latino officers felt that way. Before hiring Bratton, de Blasio called the two former mayors of Los Angeles whom Bratton had worked for, and both assured him that Bratton believed that communities and the police must work together to combat crime. Bratton âunderstood that policing had to be community-focussed and constitutional,â the former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told me. Bratton helped convince de Blasio that broken-windows policing was effective, but he also agreed that the N.Y.P.D.âs use of stop-and-frisk was excessive."],["p","Then, in July of 2014, came the death of Eric Garner, a forty-three-year-old black man arrested on Staten Island for illegally selling loose cigarettesâa classic broken-windows offense. According to the medical examiner, Garner died after being put in a choke hold by police, who were trying to restrain him, but no officer was indicted; a federal investigation is still under way. (On July 13th, the city agreed to pay the Garner family $5.9 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit.) The following month, in Ferguson, Missouri, Michael Brown, an unarmed eighteen-year-old black man, was shot and killed after an encounter with a white officer. That officer, too, was not indicted by a grand jury, and protests erupted in New York and other cities. In a press conference, de Blasio, who has a biracial son, admitted that he and his wife have âhad to literally trainâ him in âhow to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him.â Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmenâs Benevolent Association, complained to the press that de Blasio had thrown cops âunder the bus.â Then, in December, a mentally ill man shot and killed two officers as they sat in their patrol car in Brooklyn, after which he killed himself. Lynch declared that de Blasio had âblood on the hands,â and, when the Mayor met with grieving family members, a wall of police officers turned their backs on him."],["p","Recently, Bratton defended de Blasioâs remarks about his son: âEvery black Iâve ever dealt with tells me that they tell their kids the same thing. Donât you as a white parent tell your kids certain things when theyâre going out driving?â He added, âNot being black, how do we put ourselves into his shoes?â"],["p","At the memorial service in Queens, de Blasio, who is six feet five, towered over Bratton, who is five-ten. He wore a blue police windbreaker with the word â",["em",{"class":"small"},"Mayor"],"â emblazoned in yellow across the back. With his hands clasped in front, he followed and seemed to defer to Bratton, who introduced him to members of the Byrne family. Patrick Lynch was there but did not offer to shake hands, and de Blasio avoided eye contact. Bratton addressed the crowd, saying of Byrne, âHis life, his sacrifice, began a change in this city.â He talked about the unity of the N.Y.P.D. âfamily,â a word that was mentioned several times that night. The Mayor then spoke, and concluded, tepidly, âTonight, itâs so important just to remember a good young man, a good young man who represented all that we aspire to be.â Afterward, a senior police official whispered to me, âHeâs passionate about pre-K. I guess heâs not passionate about cops.â"],["p","Not long ago, I joined Bratton in his black S.U.V., as he was being driven to a farewell reception for the retiring commander of Brooklyn South, at the Sixty-seventh Precinct, in East Flatbush. He told me that the winter and early spring had been âthe most trying period of time for me in my whole career. If you look at the turbulence, not only in the city but the country, you had attacks on the police, you had anti-police momentum being generated by Washington and Eric Holderââthe Attorney General, who in March declared that the people of Ferguson feel âunder siegeâ from the police. âAnd, at the same time, police were saying, âThis is crazy. We are saving America.âÂ â"]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EOn%20most%20days%2C%20Bratton%20can%20be%20found%20in%20his%20office%2C%20on%20the%20fourteenth%20floor%20of%20One%20Police%20Plaza%2C%20a%20short%20walk%20from%20City%20Hall.%20Tall%20windows%20offer%20grand%20views%20of%20the%20East%20River%20and%20the%20Brooklyn%2C%20Manhattan%2C%20and%20Williamsburg%20Bridges.%20A%20portrait%20of%20Teddy%20Roosevelt%E2%80%94the%20police%20commissioner%20from%201895%20to%201897%E2%80%94faces%20Bratton%E2%80%99s%20wooden%20desk%2C%20which%2C%20he%20proudly%20notes%2C%20was%20once%20Roosevelt%E2%80%99s.%20When%20I%20visited%2C%20Bratton%20was%20wearing%20a%20blue%20custom-tailored%20pin-striped%20suit%2C%20a%20tightly%20knotted%20Herm%C3%A8s%20tie%2C%20a%20crisp%20white%20shirt%2C%20and%20polished%20black%20shoes%3B%20his%20thinning%20gray%20hair%20was%20carefully%20combed.%20When%20he%20receives%20visitors%2C%20he%20sits%20in%20a%20leather%20armchair.%20Behind%20him%20is%20a%20shrine%20to%20Jack%20Maple%2C%20a%20friend%20and%20former%20deputy%20commissioner%20who%20died%2C%20of%20cancer%2C%20in%202001.%20A%20carved%20puppet%20likeness%20of%20Maple%20sits%20on%20a%20credenza%20and%20is%20dressed%2C%20as%20Maple%20often%20was%2C%20in%20a%20blue%20double-breasted%20blazer%20with%20four%20gold%20buttons.%20Bratton%20once%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CJack%20is%20the%20smartest%20man%20I%E2%80%99ve%20ever%20met%20on%20crime.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBratton%20was%20raised%20in%20a%20working-class%20Catholic%20household%20in%20Dorchester%2C%20Massachusetts%2C%20and%20as%20a%20child%20he%20dreamed%20of%20being%20a%20cop.%20In%201966%2C%20at%20nineteen%20and%20unable%20to%20afford%20college%2C%20he%20enlisted%20in%20the%20Army%20and%20served%20as%20a%20military%20policeman%20in%20Vietnam.%20When%20he%20returned%20home%2C%20he%20was%20offended%20by%20the%20protests%20and%20the%20social%20unrest.%20%E2%80%9CI%20believed%20in%20order%20and%20conformity%20and%20the%20need%20for%20everyone%20to%20abide%20by%20social%20norms%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20wrote%20in%20an%20autobiography%2C%20%E2%80%9CTurnaround%3A%20How%20America%E2%80%99s%20Top%20Cop%20Reversed%20the%20Crime%20Epidemic%2C%E2%80%9D%20published%20in%201998.%20In%201970%2C%20at%20twenty-three%2C%20he%20joined%20the%20Boston%20police%20force%2C%20and%20by%201980%2C%20after%20graduating%20from%20Boston%20State%20College%2C%20he%20had%20risen%20to%20executive%20superintendent%2C%20the%20second-ranking%20official%E2%80%94in%20a%20department%20where%20the%20average%20cop%20didn%E2%80%99t%20become%20a%20sergeant%20until%20the%20age%20of%20fifty.%20The%20mayor%E2%80%99s%20press%20office%20encouraged%20him%20to%20let%20the%20magazine%20%3Cem%3EBoston%3C%2Fem%3E%20do%20a%20profile%20of%20him.%20It%20put%20his%20ambitious%20side%20on%20display.%20When%20the%20reporter%20asked%20about%20his%20future%2C%20Bratton%20responded%2C%20%E2%80%9CMy%20personal%20goal%20is%20to%20become%20commissioner.%20Be%20it%20one%20year%2C%20or%20four%20years%2C%20that%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20commissioner%20soon%20exiled%20him%20to%20a%20district%20office%2C%20and%20Bratton%20left%20the%20department%20to%20become%20chief%20of%20police%20for%20the%20Massachusetts%20Bay%20Transportation%20Authority%2C%20and%20then%20the%20superintendent%20of%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Metropolitan%20District%20Commission%20Police.%20In%201990%2C%20Robert%20Wasserman%2C%20who%20had%20worked%20with%20Bratton%20in%20Boston%2C%20and%20was%20a%20consultant%20to%20the%20New%20York%20Transit%20Authority%2C%20successfully%20pushed%20for%20Bratton%20to%20be%20appointed%20head%20of%20the%20four-thousand-member%20New%20York%20Transit%20Police.%20The%20city%20was%20in%20the%20grip%20of%20the%20crack%20epidemic%2C%20and%20the%20violent-crime%20rate%20was%20at%20a%20peak%3A%20that%20year%2C%20there%20were%20more%20than%20twenty-two%20hundred%20murders%20and%20more%20than%20a%20hundred%20thousand%20robberies.%20In%20the%20Transit%20Police%20job%2C%20Bratton%20met%20Maple%2C%20a%20tough-talking%20lieutenant%20whom%20he%20promoted%20to%20be%20his%20special%20assistant.%20Within%20two%20years%2C%20subway%20felonies%20declined%20twenty-seven%20per%20cent%20and%20robberies%20by%20a%20third.%20Fare%20evasion%2C%20which%20typically%20means%20turnstile-jumping%2C%20and%20which%2C%20according%20to%20Bratton%E2%80%99s%20book%2C%20deprived%20the%20city%20of%20eighty%20million%20dollars%20annually%2C%20was%20reduced%20by%20half.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%201992%2C%20he%20rejoined%20the%20Boston%20police%20department%20and%20soon%20became%20its%20commissioner%2C%20and%20in%201994%20he%20was%20hired%20for%20the%20top%20post%20at%20the%20N.Y.P.D.%2C%20replacing%20Ray%20Kelly.%20He%20assembled%20a%20team%20made%20up%20of%20several%20former%20colleagues%2C%20including%20Maple%20and%20Wasserman%2C%20and%20took%20on%20the%20city%E2%80%99s%20staggering%20crime%20rate.%20Led%20b

most days, Bratton can be found in his office, on the fourteenth floor of One Police Plaza, a short walk from City Hall. Tall windows offer grand views of the East River and the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges. A portrait of Teddy Rooseveltâthe police commissioner from 1895 to 1897âfaces Brattonâs wooden desk, which, he proudly notes, was once Rooseveltâs. When I visited, Bratton was wearing a blue custom-tailored pin-striped suit, a tightly knotted HermÃ¨s tie, a crisp white shirt, and polished black shoes; his thinning gray hair was carefully combed. When he receives visitors, he sits in a leather armchair. Behind him is a shrine to Jack Maple, a friend and former deputy commissioner who died, of cancer, in 2001. A carved puppet likeness of Maple sits on a credenza and is dressed, as Maple often was, in a blue double-breasted blazer with four gold buttons. Bratton once said, âJack is the smartest man Iâve ever met on crime.â"],["p","Bratton was raised in a working-class Catholic household in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and as a child he dreamed of being a cop. In 1966, at nineteen and unable to afford college, he enlisted in the Army and served as a military policeman in Vietnam. When he returned home, he was offended by the protests and the social unrest. âI believed in order and conformity and the need for everyone to abide by social norms,â he wrote in an autobiography, âTurnaround: How Americaâs Top Cop Reversed the Crime Epidemic,â published in 1998. In 1970, at twenty-three, he joined the Boston police force, and by 1980, after graduating from Boston State College, he had risen to executive superintendent, the second-ranking officialâin a department where the average cop didnât become a sergeant until the age of fifty. The mayorâs press office encouraged him to let the magazine ",["em","Boston"]," do a profile of him. It put his ambitious side on display. When the reporter asked about his future, Bratton responded, âMy personal goal is to become commissioner. Be it one year, or four years, thatâs what I want.â"],["p","The commissioner soon exiled him to a district office, and Bratton left the department to become chief of police for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, and then the superintendent of Bostonâs Metropolitan District Commission Police. In 1990, Robert Wasserman, who had worked with Bratton in Boston, and was a consultant to the New York Transit Authority, successfully pushed for Bratton to be appointed head of the four-thousand-member New York Transit Police. The city was in the grip of the crack epidemic, and the violent-crime rate was at a peak: that year, there were more than twenty-two hundred murders and more than a hundred thousand robberies. In the Transit Police job, Bratton met Maple, a tough-talking lieutenant whom he promoted to be his special assistant. Within two years, subway felonies declined twenty-seven per cent and robberies by a third. Fare evasion, which typically means turnstile-jumping, and which, according to Brattonâs book, deprived the city of eighty million dollars annually, was reduced by half."],["p","In 1992, he rejoined the Boston police department and soon became its commissioner, and in 1994 he was hired for the top post at the N.Y.P.D., replacing Ray Kelly. He assembled a team made up of several former colleagues, including Maple and Wasserman, and took on the cityâs staggering crime rate. Led by Maple, the deputy commissioner of crime-control strategies, the N.Y.P.D. established a computerized system called CompStat, which has evolved into a tool that, among other things, can identify and track the hard-core criminals who commit a disproportionate percentage of crimes in the city. Between 1993 and 1995, felony crimes fell by nearly forty per cent. Some credit goes to Giulianiâs predecessor as mayor, David Dinkins, who added six thousand officers to a police force that eventually grew to nearly forty-one thousand, and saw crime decline, on average, six per cent annually in the last years of his administration. With Bratton as commissioner, the annual decline more than doubled."],["p","The press celebrated Bratton, which angered Giuliani, who eventually drove him out. In April of 1996, Bratton was recruited to work in New York for a Boston private-security firm, and for the next six years he worked as a corporate executive in the security business. Then, in 2002, he became L.A.âs chief of police. The city was still recovering from the arrest and beating of Rodney King, in 1991, and the police there faced âcharges of excessive force, false arrests, and unreasonable searches and seizures,â Bratton said. âIt was an opportunity to reform and reshape the department.â"],["p","In 2009, Bratton returned to New York to run a large private-security firm. At the time, the N.Y.P.D. relied heavily on stop-and-frisk. In 2011, there were nearly seven hundred thousand stop-and-frisk incidents in New York, ninety-one per cent of them involving citizens of color. Fully half of the stop-and-frisks were based on âfurtive movements,â a vague category that can be easily abused if an officer is uncomfortable around people of color. By the end of 2013, Kelly, facing public pressure, had reduced the number to less than two hundred thousand, and in 2014, after a federal judge called for changes to the practice on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment, Bratton brought it down to fifty thousand. Despite many fewer stop-and-frisks, the crime rate remained low."],["p","âThe No. 1 issue we heard over and over again was that the black communityârich, poor, middle classâwas concerned about this issue,â Bratton told me. âThe commissioner, whom they liked quite a bit, and Mayor Bloomberg, who polled well for a long time, just werenât listening. They were kind of tone-deaf to this issue. So we worked really hard, myself and Mayor de Blasio, to respond.â When I mentioned this to Ray Kelly, he fumed. âThat was not the feeling of much of the communities of color,â he said. âIt was the view of activists. Iâm telling him, heâs wrong.â He defended stop-and-frisk as an essential crime-fighting tool, noting that the police department had twenty-three million citizen contacts and answered twelve million calls per year.

continues to be central to the N.Y.P.D.âs operation, and the model has spread to other cities. The CompStat meeting is held every Thursday morning, from 8 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"a.m."]," to noon, in the cavernous Jack Maple Room, on the eighth floor of Police Headquarters. A rotating group of officers from the five boroughs takes part, and sometimes Bratton attends. On the day I sat in, the officers were discussing the recurrent problem of neighborhood gangs. In the Sixty-seventh Precinct, for example, they have identified two hundred and eighty-seven gang members, who were responsible for the majority of the felonies in the district."],["p","âPolice departments all over the country use CompStat,â Jeffrey Fagan, a prominent criminologist and a law professor at Columbia University, told me. âTheyâre looking to see where the crimes are happening and what to do about it. So Bratton gets credit for starting CompStat and for allocating cops. Thatâs a very good thing.â"],["p","Brattonâs embrace of broken-windows policing is more controversial. He credits it with playing an important role in reducing crime in New York, Boston, and L.A. And the most recent F.B.I. data, from 2013, show that, of the nationâs twenty-five largest cities, New York has the lowest rate of major felonies. Detroitâs murder rate is ten times New Yorkâs, and Philadelphiaâs and Chicagoâs are three times as high. In his autobiography, Bratton notes that when he ran the Transit Police, in the early nineties, one out of seven people stopped for fare-beating had an outstanding warrant, and one in twenty-one was found to be carrying a weapon."],["p","âMore than any other factor, what caused this amazing change was Broken Windows, or quality-of-life policing,â Bratton wrote in a department report in April. He told me, âIn the early nineteen-nineties, we were losing tourists because of the awful crime numbers we had.â Today, he said, most New Yorkers âfeel safe. Just look at the sheer volume of people riding the subways at night.â Broken-windows, he says, âis about quality of life, about freedom from fear, about freedom from disturbance.â Minor crimesâpatronizing a prostitute or a drug dealerâhad been ignored because they were seen as victimless. âWhat was not understood was that the victim was the neighborhood.â"],["p","Bratton is at pains to emphasize that broken-windows policing is not stop-and-frisk. With stop-and-frisk, he said, âan officer has a reasonable suspicion that a crime is committed, is about to be committed, or has been committed. Quality-of-life policing is based on probable causeâan officer has witnessed a crime personally, or has a witness to the crime. Itâs far different.â The difference is irrelevant to many critics, who see an approach that presumes guilt and unfairly targets minorities. Broken-windows theory and stop-and-frisk âhave the same ideology,â Josmar Trujillo, a co-founder of New Yorkers Against Bratton and a member of the Coalition to End Broken Windows, told me. Trujillo added that heâd happily see the N.Y.P.D.âs force reduced by half. âWe live in a place where police are constantly in our lives, acting as if they expect crime.â"],["p","Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform, a citywide umbrella group comprising dozens of organizations, said that, at least anecdotally, far more summonses are issued to people âin Bedford-Stuyvesant who may be on their stoop enjoying a can of beerâ than to, say, picnickers in Central Park sharing a bottle of champagne. Broken-windows invites âthe N.Y.P.D. to go on a fishing expedition,â Kang said. âItâs basically racial profiling for people under the assumption that they have outstanding warrants.â"],["p","Bratton argues that many broken-windows arrests are prompted by 911 and 311 calls from citizens, most of whom complain about misdemeanors, such as traffic offenses, public intoxication, urinating in public, drug use, disorderly youths, and street noise. Vanessa Gibson, who chairs the City Councilâs Committee on Public Safety, and whose district includes part of the South Bronx, said that she is more open to broken-windows. âI was of the mind-set that police basically patrolled neighborhoods, stopped when they saw young people on a corner, and started asking questions when they saw suspicious activity,â she said. âI didnât understand, as I do now, that police are responding to 911 and 311 calls.â"],["p","Bratton also notes that most violent crimes take place in minority neighborhoods. In 2014, ninety-eight per cent of the suspects in shootings were black or Hispanic, and seventy-six per cent of rape victims, seventy-one per cent of robbery victims, and seventy-one per cent of assault victims were people of color. Between eighty and ninety per cent of citizens support the broken-windows strategy, he said. A Quinnipiac University poll released in May found that, when black voters were asked if they generally supported broken-windows, sixty-one per cent said they did. But, when the same citizens were asked if they approved or disapproved of the way the New York City police were doing their job, fifty per cent of blacks and forty-one per cent of Hispanics disapproved, whereas just twenty per cent of white voters disapproved."],["p","Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, who retired from the N.Y.P.D. as a captain in 2006, explained the contradiction. Adams said that he supports broken-windows but that âthere has been a systemic problem, because of twenty years of aggressive, unequal enforcement.â Under Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg, officers felt encouraged, he said, to âmake as many contacts as possible with people based on their race and ethnicity and where they live. These contacts were done through stop-and-friskâ and misdemeanor arrests. Adams went on, âIt was about instilling fear in people. It has started to change, but itâs like moving an ocean liner.â"],["p","Critics say, however, that broken-windows is not nearly as successful as it claims to be. The crime rate in New York fell in the nineteen-ninetiesâbut it also fell in San Diego, Houston, Dallas, and other cities that were not using the same strategy. âThereâs no good scientific evidence that broken-windows works or has much to do with crime,â Fagan said. âAnd the few claims for it that people try to make have been contested. None of them stand up to really close examination. So whatâs left? Bratton can say all he wants that broken-windows works, and he can look at large correlations between misdemeanor arrests and declines in crime, but thereâs no plausible connection between the two. Marijuana smokers are not criminals on their day off.â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoons%252F593b63ec6f669264efc13949%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63ec6f669264efc13949%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoons%2F593b63ec6f669264efc13949%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b63ec6f669264efc13949"}]],["p","Bratton conceded, âYouâre not going to find the scientific study that can support broken-windows one way or the other.â He added, âThe evidence I rely on is what my eyes show me,â and he pointed to âthe reduction of fearâ that he sees in rejuvenated neighborhoods like Times Square.

day recently in a courtroom at Manhattanâs Criminal Court Building, at 100 Centre Street, thirty-one defendants who had been arrested for misdemeanors appeared before the judge. Only one was whiteâa homeless man. Two of the defendants had been apprehended the day before as trespassers for using a Port Authority bathroom that the police said required that they show a bus ticket. âThey threw me against the wall, completely searched me, patted and frisked me in front of all these people, and threw cuffs on me,â Wendell Moore, a thirty-two-year-old man and a father of seven children, told me. The police found a cell phone on him that they claimed was not his. He spent the night in jail, and the next day was charged and released. âOther people going to that bathroom they didnât stop,â Moore said. âThey only stopped two black kids. They didnât know who had tickets.â"],["p","Ed McCarthy, a longtime Legal Aid attorney, told me that broken-windows arrests have a way of steering people into the criminal-justice system. Clients who are younger than Moore often plead guilty, he said, because the alternative is worse: âYou have a kid whoâs nineteen, twenty years of age. Heâs no longer eligible for youthful-offender status. Heâs now jumped a turnstile for the third or fourth time, and the D.A.âs policy is âNo, heâs had his chance. Heâs going to be arrested or stay in jail because heâs had a couple of warrants.â And, of course, if youâre nineteen and the choice is plead guilty, get a record, and go home, or risk going into Rikers for four or five days or even longer, what would you do? You obviously are going to plead guilty.â A criminal record of any kind can prevent a person from getting a job. And, because broken-windows singles out ârecidivists,â convictions can quickly accumulate."],["p","Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York branch of the A.C.L.U., said of Brattonâs defense of broken-windows, âThere is insufficient concern that a generation of young people, particularly young men of color, have grown up thinking that their legal rights arenât worth anything, that their dignity isnât worth anything, that their freedom isnât worth anything.â She went on, âThatâs a huge omission. It doesnât speak of racial animus. It speaks of a race-bound kind of tunnel vision about how we look at social policy and at policing policy in particular.â"],["p","In April, de Blasio again expressed support for the broken-windows approach. âI want to emphasize, my vision of quality-of-life policing and my vision related to the broken-windows strategy is the same as Commissioner Brattonâs,â he said. But many left-leaning activists struggle to understand his reasoning. âDe Blasio canât credibly present himself as a progressive dedicated to equality when broken-windows is both a violation of human rights and a âTale of Two Citiesâ writ large,â Robert Gangi, the director of the Police Reform Organizing Project, and a longtime critic of broken-windows, told me. Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, has called for low-level offenses such as public urination and turnstile-jumping to be decriminalized. Bratton has opposed such efforts. However, last November, the police department reduced the penalty for the possession of small amounts of marijuana from an arrest to a summons."],["p","In August of last year, Bratton publicly conceded that the video showing the choke hold that led to the death of Eric Garner was âcertainly disturbing.â And although Bratton maintains that community policing has always been central to his work, his closest advisers have acknowledged the need to adjust the departmentâs policing strategies. âThe police environment has changed,â Robert Wasserman says. In 1994, when Bratton began his first tenure as N.Y.P.D. commissioner, crime was rampant, and the issues that he addressed revolved around what Wasserman called âpolicing solutions,â and consulting the community was not the highest priority. Today, Wasserman added, Bratton has to overcome the communityâs âsense that cops only want to arrest people.â Jeffrey Fagan, of Columbia, told me, âWhen people arenât in love with the police, they donât help the police, they donât coÃ¶perate with the police. Communities are the experts on crime, not the police; they know who the bad guys are.â"],["p","âOne of the biggest challenges facing me now,â Bratton said, âis to continue to advocate for, and continue to implement, broken-windows, quality-of-life policing, because I think itâs essential to how the city feels about itself, and it has an impact on over-all crime. We should not make the mistake of my predecessor on the stop-question-and-frisk issue.

often says that the police are âsales repsâ and citizens are âcustomers.â At a buffet breakfast at the Greater Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church, in Jamaica, Queens, last February, he told the audience that the N.Y.P.D. âneeds to face the hard truth that in our most vulnerable neighborhoods we have a problem with citizen satisfaction. We are often abrupt, sometimes rude, and thatâs unacceptable.â Subsequently, Bratton told me, âWe want cops to be able to see the people theyâre policing. In this department, and maybe in a lot of American policing today, unfortunately, too many members donât treat people appropriately.â"],["p","In late June, in an effort to improve customer service, Bratton unveiled a new neighborhood-policing plan called âOne City: Safe and FairâEverywhere,â which assigns the same officers to the same areas (rather than shifting them around) and has them spend a third of their shifts on foot, talking with residents, merchants, and community leaders. Since January, all officers are required to take a three-day training course each year, one day of which has been devoted to âSmart Policing,â which aims to improve how the police interact with citizens."],["p","At 7 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"A.M."]," on a Wednesday in June, I joined a hundred or so officers from the South Bronxâs Forty-fourth Precinct in a classroom at the Police Academy, in College Point, Queens, for a daylong tutorial on empathy and discretion. Detective Ricky Taggart, a thirty-year veteran of the N.Y.P.D.âjacketless, gun on hip, rose-colored suspenders over a midnight-blue shirtâpaced back and forth at the front of the room. In a booming voice, Taggart told the assembled officers that the N.Y.P.D. does âa great job,â but âwe can do better.â The dayâs lesson was meant to be a âskill enhancer,â focussing on improving the officersâ interpersonal skills. In the course of the day, they were cautioned to listen, be patient, and control their emotions and anger. âIf an irate citizen starts yelling at you, donât take it as a personal attack,â he said."],["p","After lunch in the cafeteria, the officers reassembled for a presentation by Moise TinguÃ©, a sergeant who has been on the force for twenty-three years. TinguÃ© dimmed the lights, and on a large screen behind him the words âWhat Is Winning?â appeared, introducing a PowerPoint presentation. TinguÃ© said, âWinning is gaining voluntary complianceââan officer can stop to listen to a suspectâs explanation or ask him to comply, rather than immediately issuing a summons or reaching for his handcuffs. He showed videos of officers using excessive forceâbashing young protesters on the Lower East Side, trying to control a demonstration on the Brooklyn Bridge. Then he highlighted an officer whoâd been punched but, instead of lashing out at other, nonviolent demonstrators, and provoking a melee, calmly stayed in position."],["p","The officers in the room, who ranged in age from early twenties to late fifties and in rank from rookie to precinct commander, were serious and attentive. The mood brightened when Taggart returned and displayed the opening screen of another PowerPoint presentation: âControlling Language: Do We Have to Curse?â He played a clip of Dustin Hoffman, in âMidnight Cowboy,â cursing, and of Robert De Niro, in âTaxi Driver,â swearing constantly. As a counterpoint, Taggart then played an audio clip of Captain Chesley Sullenberger III, the U.S. Airways pilot who, in 2009, landed his Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after a flock of geese flew into the engines and disabled them. Not once did Sullenberger curse or raise his voice, Taggart noted. He offered some suggestions. Instead of shouting âFuck you!â or âShut the fuck up!,â the officers could try alternatives, like âStop mucking around!â or âMove the car, my friend.â The officers burst into laughter. âRemember, ladies and gentlemen, weâre the professionals,â Taggart said. âThe people out there are our customers.â"],["p","Bratton has no illusions that a three-day-a-year class is an antidote for insensitivity or for the biases that afflict some officers in New York and other cities. Still, he noted, most of the complaints that citizens have about the police âare about language: âAn officer swore at me.â âHe treated me disrespectfully.âÂ â Bratton went on, âA lot of the training that weâre doing with our officersâ is centered âon an officerâs approach to people and treating them respectfully.

are deep fissures within the N.Y.P.D. During the past decade, the department has failed to raise the number of black cops above sixteen per cent, in a city where blacks make up twenty-three per cent of the population. In June, black trainees were just ten per cent of the Police Academyâs graduating class. First Deputy Commissioner Ben B. Tucker places the blame for the problem, in part, on the fact that black candidates have a higher percentage of quality-of-life violations on their record, so they donât get a second look. (The N.Y.P.D. says it is changing this process.) A bigger reason, he believes, is that many young blacks donât aspire to be cops âbecause of how they were treatedâ by them. âWeâre not user-friendly.â"],["p","In his office late one afternoon, Bratton told me, âYouâve got the historical issue of the tension between the black population and the police.â In Los Angeles, he commissioned a study to determine why the L.A.P.D. was having a hard time recruiting black officers. The main factor, he said, was âmothers, sisters, girlfriends, who for years had seen their men being disrespected by the police. And in L.A. there was a practice of putting people down, kneeling on the sidewalk, hands behind their head. âWhy do you want to join an organization thatâs been so disrespectful of you?â So the profession was not one that was honored in the black community.â Bratton added, âHere, right now, weâve got several factors at work,â including, âin recent times, the Trayvon Martin and the Garner incidents, and the incident in Missouri.â"],["p","Creating a force of more empathetic cops requires more than diversifying its composition. Itâs also a matter of changing the way officers view their jobs. Stephen P. Davis, a retired police captain who worked with Bratton in New York in the nineties, and who now works for him as deputy commissioner of public information, said, âWe never looked at ourselves as a social agency.â Doing so, he added, would mean that âwe are not really law-enforcement officers. It means we are public-safety officers. Cops donât like that. They feel it makes them like social workers.â Ekow Yankah, of Cardozo, says that changing the police culture requires a more dramatic approach, starting with âwhom we recruit to be police officers.â He approves of Brattonâs efforts to train cops âto have a different attitude,â but says that itâs also essential to âfind the person who enjoys wielding power and weed him out.â"],["p","Whatever Bratton does, heâll have to contend with the P.B.A. president, Patrick Lynch, who staunchly defends individual officers even when they are accused of abuse. Lynch and his staff of a hundred occupy the eleventh floor of 125 Broad Street, at the tip of Manhattan. Lynch, who is fifty-one, was first elected president of the twenty-three-thousand-member union at the age of thirty-five. He told me that he supports Brattonâs initiative to subject all cops to three extra days of training annually and conceded that officers âneed training on how to bring someone to the ground who is resisting arrest.â"],["p","Lynch can sound reasonable, but he can quickly turn bellicose. Before he was reÃ«lected, in June, the P.B.A. Web site attacked his critics within the organization as âtraitors to the unionâ who âplayed right into the hands of our liberal, cop-hating Mayor.â This spring, Lynch told me that cops have âthe worst relationsâ with City Hall in three decades, because they lack de Blasioâs support. âWe feel we get it from the police commissionerâs office. But when it comes from City Hall it feels like a throwaway line, like he really doesnât believe what heâs saying.â I asked Lynch about his âblood on the handsâ remark regarding de Blasio. âThose were the words and feelings of members,â he said. The demonstrations and the Mayorâs words created an environment that âled to the assassination of two police officers.â Of the gunman who killed the two officers in December, he said, âWhy did he travel to New York? The answer is that the atmosphere here was fertile.â"],["p","Bratton believes that Lynch has failed to credit de Blasio for giving the department things that support police officers, including bulletproof vests that are more protective and thirty per cent lighter, as well as a smartphone for every officer and tablets for sixty-five hundred patrol cars, giving officers quick access to data and reducing the amount of paperwork. Still, the P.B.A. has gone without a new contract since 2010. This past spring, Melissa Mark-Viverito, the City Council speaker, and Letitia James, the cityâs public advocate, among others, called for the Mayor to add a thousand cops, a request that fell short of Lynchâs request for an increase of seven thousand. De Blasio opposed adding more officers, but Bratton, without specifying a number, publicly declared that the department needed them."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20Polo%20Bar%2C%20Ralph%20Lauren%E2%80%99s%20new%20restaurant%2C%20off%20Fifth%20Avenue%2C%20is%20a%20difficult%20reservation%20to%20secure%2C%20but%2C%20on%20a%20week%20night%20in%20late%20March%2C%20Bratton%20and%20his%20wife%2C%20Rikki%20Klieman%2C%20a%20legal%20analyst%20for%20CBS%20News%20and%20a%20former%20criminal-defense%20attorney%2C%20were%20sitting%20in%20a%20choice%20banquette%20along%20the%20wall.%20%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20the%20new%20%E2%80%98in%E2%80%99%20spot%20for%20the%20one-per-centers%2C%E2%80%9D%20Bratton%20said%2C%20with%20a%20chuckle.%20They%20greeted%20Dylan%20Lauren%2C%20Ralph%E2%80%99s%20daughter%2C%20and%20the%20WNBC-TV%20anchor%20Chuck%20Scarborough%20and%20his%20wife%2C%20Ellen%2C%20who%20are%20friends%20of%20the%20couple%20in%20the%20Hamptons.%20Then%20Bratton%20pointed%20out%20his%20two%20favorite%20items%20on%20the%20menu%3A%20the%20rib-eye%20steak%20from%20Ralph%20Lauren%E2%80%99s%20Colorado%20ranch%20and%20the%20corned-beef%20sandwich.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhile%20running%20for%20mayor%2C%20de%20Blasio%20exhorted%20rich%20New%20Yorkers%20to%20cede%20more%20of%20their%20income%20to%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20other%20New%20York.%E2%80%9D%20As%20a%20result%2C%20Bratton%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cone-per-centers%20have%20a%20significant%20dislike%E2%80%9D%20of%20de%20Blasio%2C%20but%20he%20added%20that%20%E2%80%9Cthey%20have%20a%20hard%20time%20pointing%20to%20anything%20negative%20he%E2%80%99s%20done%20since%20he%E2%80%99s%20been%20elected.%E2%80%9D%20He%20praised%20de%20Blasio%E2%80%99s%20introduction%20of%20universal%20pre-K%20education%2C%20his%20support%20for%20affordable%20housing%2C%20and%20his%20maintenance%20of%20a%20vibrant%20economy.%20As%20for%20policing%2C%20he%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9CThere%E2%80%99s%20nothing%20we%E2%80%99ve%20disagreed%20on%20in%20the%20months%20I%E2%80%99ve%20worked%20for%20him.%20He%E2%80%99s%20done%20more%20for%20the%20police%20than%20any%20mayor%20I%E2%80%99ve%20served%20in%20thirty%20years.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBratton%20has%20a%20two-hour%20meeting%20with%20the%20Mayor%20every%20week%2C%20and%20they%20talk%20regularly.%20%E2%80%9CHis%20temperament%20is%20very%20much%20like%20mine%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20said.%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20like%20this%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94he%20held%20two%20steady%20hands%20horizontally%20over%20his%20charred%20rib%20eye.%20%E2%80%9CEven%20in%20the%20midst%20of%20all%20the%20demonstrations%20and%20craziness%20in%20December%20and%20January%2C%20there%20was%20no%20screaming%2C%20no%20demanding.%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20very%20collaborative%20individual.%E2%80%9D%20John%20Miller%2C%20the%20deputy%20commissioner%20for%20intelligence%20and%20counterterrorism%2C%20and%20Bratton%E2%80%99s%20confidant%2C%20told%20me%20that%2C%20in%20contrast%20to%20Giuliani%2C%20%E2%80%9CMayor%20de%20Blasio%20is%20very%20comfortable%20conducting%20an%20orchestra.%20Giuliani%20was%20a%20soloist.%20He%20didn%E2%80%99t%20like%20any%20instruments%20to%20play%20too%20loud.%E2%80%9D%20De%20Blasio%20declined%20to%20be%20interviewed%2C%20but%20Anthony%20E.%20Shorris%2C%20the%20first%20deputy%20mayor%2C%20told%20me%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99ve%20never%20seen%20anybody%20have%20a%20bad%20moment%20face%20to%20face%2C%20even%20on%20a%20staff%20level.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ESo%20far%2C%20de%20Blasio%E2%80%99s%20need%20to%20appear%20pro-police%20seems%20to%20work%20in%20Bratton%E2%80%99s%20favor.%20On%20June%2022nd%2C%20the%20Mayor%20announced%20that%20he%20had%20agreed%20to%20add%20thirteen%20hundred%20cops%20to%20the%20force%E2%80%94three%20hundred%20more%20than%20the%20number%20sought%20by%20Mark-Viverito.%20The%20next%20day%2C%20Bratton%20invited%20minority%20ministers%20from%20around%20the%20city%20to%20an%20Urban%20Ministers%20Symposium%2C%20in%20the%20gymnasium-like%20auditorium%20of%20Police%20Headquarters%2C%20where%20they%20were%20briefed%20on%20what%20the%20department%20is%20doing%20to%20improve%20community%20relations%2C%20and%20were%20asked%20for%20their%20help%20in%20preventing%20crime%20and%20in%20recruiting%20more%20black%20cops.%20De%20Blasio%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20scheduled%20to%20appear%2C%20but%20he%20came%2C%20he%20said%2C%20because%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20commissioner%20told%20me%20of%20this%20extraordinary%20gathering.%E2%80%9D%20He%20extolled%20New%20York%20as%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20safest%20big%20city%20in%20America%E2%80%9D%20and%20praised%20the%20%E2%80%9Cprofound%20reforms%20under%20way%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20N.Y.P.D.%20For%20months%2C%20he%20had%20flatly%20insisted%20that%20no%20new%20cops%20would%20be%20added%20to%20the%20department%3B%20now%20he%20suggested%20that%20he%20had%20always%20been%20in%20favor%20of%20enlarging%20the%20force%20to%20support%20Bratton%E2%80%99s%20efforts%20to%20improve%20neighborhood%20policing.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EAt%20a%20press%20conference%20afterward%2C%20a%20reporter%20asked%20Bratton%20what%20role%20he%20had%20played%20in%20s

Polo Bar, Ralph Laurenâs new restaurant, off Fifth Avenue, is a difficult reservation to secure, but, on a week night in late March, Bratton and his wife, Rikki Klieman, a legal analyst for CBS News and a former criminal-defense attorney, were sitting in a choice banquette along the wall. âThis is the new âinâ spot for the one-per-centers,â Bratton said, with a chuckle. They greeted Dylan Lauren, Ralphâs daughter, and the WNBC-TV anchor Chuck Scarborough and his wife, Ellen, who are friends of the couple in the Hamptons. Then Bratton pointed out his two favorite items on the menu: the rib-eye steak from Ralph Laurenâs Colorado ranch and the corned-beef sandwich."],["p","While running for mayor, de Blasio exhorted rich New Yorkers to cede more of their income to âthe other New York.â As a result, Bratton said, âone-per-centers have a significant dislikeâ of de Blasio, but he added that âthey have a hard time pointing to anything negative heâs done since heâs been elected.â He praised de Blasioâs introduction of universal pre-K education, his support for affordable housing, and his maintenance of a vibrant economy. As for policing, he said, âThereâs nothing weâve disagreed on in the months Iâve worked for him. Heâs done more for the police than any mayor Iâve served in thirty years.â"],["p","Bratton has a two-hour meeting with the Mayor every week, and they talk regularly. âHis temperament is very much like mine,â he said. âIâm like thisââhe held two steady hands horizontally over his charred rib eye. âEven in the midst of all the demonstrations and craziness in December and January, there was no screaming, no demanding. Heâs a very collaborative individual.â John Miller, the deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, and Brattonâs confidant, told me that, in contrast to Giuliani, âMayor de Blasio is very comfortable conducting an orchestra. Giuliani was a soloist. He didnât like any instruments to play too loud.â De Blasio declined to be interviewed, but Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, told me, âIâve never seen anybody have a bad moment face to face, even on a staff level.â"],["p","So far, de Blasioâs need to appear pro-police seems to work in Brattonâs favor. On June 22nd, the Mayor announced that he had agreed to add thirteen hundred cops to the forceâthree hundred more than the number sought by Mark-Viverito. The next day, Bratton invited minority ministers from around the city to an Urban Ministers Symposium, in the gymnasium-like auditorium of Police Headquarters, where they were briefed on what the department is doing to improve community relations, and were asked for their help in preventing crime and in recruiting more black cops. De Blasio wasnât scheduled to appear, but he came, he said, because âthe commissioner told me of this extraordinary gathering.â He extolled New York as âthe safest big city in Americaâ and praised the âprofound reforms under wayâ in the N.Y.P.D. For months, he had flatly insisted that no new cops would be added to the department; now he suggested that he had always been in favor of enlarging the force to support Brattonâs efforts to improve neighborhood policing."],["p","At a press conference afterward, a reporter asked Bratton what role he had played in securing the added cops. He conceded that the over-all total, thirteen hundred, was ânot a number that was just pulled out of the skyâthis was a very specific, detailed number,â and one that his staff had privately recommended to the Mayor after a careful analysis."],["p","Another reporter asked how, if crime is so low, Bratton convinced the Mayor that the city needs more officers. Bratton replied that there are more 911 and 311 calls, more danger from terrorists, a million more residents than in the nineteen-nineties, and more tourists. The city was growing, âand the police department had not been.â He said that the workforce increase would bolster the experimental community-policing program. Shorris told me that âthere was no rationaleâ for adding more officers in order to fight crime, since New York âis the safest major city in the U.S. But the argument that found a sympathetic ear with the Mayor was a much more profound question about how to change policing.â"],["p","During the press conference, however, when I asked Bratton about his commitment to broken-windows, he said, âQuality-of-life policing is not going away. Not so long as Iâm commissioner, and I donât think so long as Mayor de Blasio is mayor. He understands it. He believes in it. We are committed to it. But we are committed to doing it in a way that, unlike unfortunately what happened with stop-question-and-friskâwe will continue to try and do it in a way that is not alienating but, rather, gaining support for what we do.â"],["p","Ekow Yankah told me, âI actually think this is sad, in a way. Bratton is a complicated guy. He strikes me in some ways as deeply caring that police do better both for police officers and for citizens. So I donât think heâs some awful bogeyman.â But, he said, âno matter how much good he does, I think the legacy of broken-windows will be a huge scar. Because otherwise heâd have a chance of having a tremendous legacy.â"],["p","At the Polo Bar, I asked Bratton if he had given any thought to his legacy. He had, of course: âThat I will once again accomplish what I set out to do many years ago and become the most significant person in policing in the country.

first shot of Catherine (Elisabeth Moss), the presiding figure in âQueen of Earth,â is not a pretty sight. Her face, filling the screen, is a war zone of tears and maddened makeup, and her voice cracks with every plea and plaint: âWhy are you doing this to me?â and âI donât want you to see me like thisââquite a statement, with the camera looming as close as a confessor. She is in the throes of being rejected by her boyfriend, James (Kentucker Audley), whoâboth in this opening scene and elsewhereâis barely half a character. His motives are of little consequence; he is a mere moon, striving to free himself from Catherineâs gravitational pull. Good luck to him."],["p","The bulk of the film, which was written and directed by Alex Ross Perry, takes place after the breakup. Catherine, who has also lost her fatherââa prominent New York artiste,â in her wordsâseeks refuge in a peaceful lakeside house with her pal Virginia (Katherine Waterston). It belongs to Virginiaâs family, and the two women are mostly there alone. Catherine draws and paints, while Virginia looks after herâor, at any rate, looks ",["em","at"]," her, standing by her bedside while she sleeps and gazing at her with an air of mystification. Now and then, their idyll, such as it is, gets interrupted. A neighbor called Rich (Patrick Fugit) has a habit of dropping by, making out with Virginia, and getting on Catherineâs nerves. Also, we keep cutting to flashbacks from the year before, when Catherine, sporting scarlet lipstick, with her hair cropped short, came to stay at the house, bringing James. Supposedly, it was a cheerier occasion, and there was a brightness to Catherine that has now been overcast by her fug of grief; yet even then the mood was brittle, with Virginia looking at the happy couple and declaring, âYou seem cripplingly codependent.â (Has anyone ever spoken such a line, as opposed to writing it?) To which Catherine replied, âWe donât.â"],["p","If the studio heads at Twentieth Century Fox wanted to save money this year, they should have bought âQueen of Earthâ and released it instead of âFantastic Four.â You want rolling mayhem, with a quartet of characters in the thrall of outlandish forces they can barely control? Meet Catherine, Virginia, Rich, and Jamesâsuperheroes of unpleasantness, who can wreck the most basic of social encounters. Cups are hurled against a wall or tossed into the lake. At a party, Catherine chokes on potato chips and crawls from the room on her hands and knees, amid jeers and leers, with not a single guest lending assistance. Virginia on other humans: âOnce they become envy drains, I have to have nothing to do with them, I canât help it. I just hate them.â Catherine to Rich: âYou pry into the lives of others to conceal how worthless and boring your own life is.â She adds, by way of a kicker, âYou are why depression exists.â Rich to Catherine: âStuck-up brat.â Catherine to Virginia: âSpoiled brat.â The whole thing heats up into a competition: Which brat is worst?"],["p","Fans of Alex Ross Perry will point out that hostility is his natural terrain, that people in his films are born to bridle, and that, if you want niceness, you could always stay home and watch âPillow Talk.â After all, Perryâs previous work, âListen Up Philip,â by introducing an ambitious young writer to an established older one, Ike Zimmerman, showed what happens when a burgeoning monster of egotism meets the fully grown breed. But that was a funny movie, with a voice-over that dangled its foolish creatures for our delight, whereas âQueen of Earthâ is slightly less amusing than smallpox. We get in-jokes (Virginia reads Zimmermanâs âMadness and Womenâ) but no jokes; plenty of onscreen laughter, fissuring into hysteria, but no laughs. The intensity is compounded by the sound editing, which turns every slurp of coffee into a deafening slosh, and by the creepy dedication of the camera, which never retreats to a polite distance when it can lean in and stare at someone, face to face."],["p","The model here is Bergman. You cannot banish a couple of women, one of them nearing mental dissolution, to rural solitude without raising the ghosts of Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson, in âPersona.â As Catherine describes her âself-perpetuating cycle of defeat,â it is the listening Virginia on whom we focus: a very Bergmanish device, forcing us to ask whether other souls, with their endless anxieties, are there to be suffered or sympathized with. That uncertainty survives in âQueen of Earth.â When Catherine rubs her head and talks of âbones grinding underneath my skin,â you want to stop the movie and summon professional help, yet at other times she comes across as a spoiled little rich girl, and there isnât a flicker of the wider worldânothing to match the unforgettable shot of Ullmann, in âPersona,â huddled in the corner of a room and shrinking in horror from the images on TV. That film also made emotional sense as a study of a patient and her nurse, whereas when Catherine calls Virginia âmy best friendâ I simply didnât buy it; nothing in their conduct speaks of good companionship, still less of love.

release of âThe Black Panthers: Vanguard of a Revolutionâ is well timed. Next year will mark half a century since Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panthers, in Oakland, California. Even those who opposed or feared them would be hard pressed to claim that the grievances from which the movement sprangâthe economic subjection of African-Americans, and humiliation at the hands of the authoritiesâhave been answered, let alone assuaged. Many aging Panthers are interviewed in Stanley Nelsonâs documentary, and one of them describes a typical recruit to the cause: âThe brother whoâs going to jail, just snatched out of his car for a traffic ticket, just because he was blackâthatâs who weâre after.â If you asked them about the recent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, or indeed about Sandra Bland, who was pulled over in Waller County, Texas, in July, and later died in police custody, I doubt that they would show much surprise."],["p","With no narrator to shepherd us along, the movie feels noisy and restless. The period is revived by a wealth of songs on the soundtrack, and by the sleek and succulent Panther look. The black beret, the leather jacket, the bountiful hair: has any demeanor made such an impact, so fast? And who, if anyone, dreamed it up? Nelson doesnât say, which is a shame, but photographers came flocking, and he is at liberty to feast on the images, both still and moving, that ensued. According to the film, it was Newton, wise to legal statutes, who realized that arms could be borne on public property, as long as they were openly displayed; this meant that the Panthers could stroll into the California state legislature, say, with weapons poised. How better to make a spectacle of yourself? A teen-ager named Michael McCarty was impressed. âWhen I heard about Sacramento, I was, like, ",["em","damn"],", these brothers are bad,â he recalls. âTheyâre here up in Sacramento, in the capitol? ",["em","Packing"],"?â"],["p","So fluent are McCarty and his fellow-recollectors, and so evident is Nelsonâs nostalgia for a fervid era, that anyone wanting a balanced account of the Panthersâ exploits may find the film more rousing than reliable. The 1969 police raid on a Panthers hangout, in Los Angeles, is presented entirely as a one-sided affair; any input from the other side is dismissed by Wayne Pharr, who was then in the house, with an easy shrug. âMy gun just went off,â he says. âI donât know what happened, it just went off.â As for Eldridge Cleaver, the most eloquent of the Panthers, you can understand why people warmed to the blaze of his charisma and still recoil from the misogyny of his youth; in an admission absent from the film, he claimed to have âstarted out by practicing on black girls in the ghettoâ before moving onto âwhite prey,â on the principle that ârape was an insurrectionary act.â By contrast, there were some episodes in the saga of the Panthers that allowed no ambiguity. Whatever you think of Seale (one of the so-called Chicago Eight, tried for conspiracy and incitement to riot, in 1969), the sight of him being bound and gagged in the courtroom, as he tried to defend himself, should remain a permanent scar on the public conscience."],["p","So who will be swayed by Nelsonâs film? First, kids emerging from âStraight Outta Compton,â all fired up, and wanting to learn about earlier manifestations of rage. (Not that the Panthers reaped financial fruit, of the sort that would be plucked by their hip-hop descendants. The most successful feat in Panther history was also the most prosaic: serving free breakfasts to the children of the poor.) Second, any writers and directors who like to delve for stories among the folk who live and protest at the heart of political frenzy. Imagine what Ava DuVernay, the maker of âSelma,â could do with the tale of Elaine Brown, who chaired the Black Panthers between 1974 and 1977. âI was a cocktail waitress in a white strip club two years before I joined the Black Panther Party,â she says. âHow did that happen?â Boom. Thereâs a whole movie, right there.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/hostile-territory","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7022d4972cd5b83381","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alex Ross Perry","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"alex-ross-perry"},{"id":"5c2e1c842bc86f2c9a2449b4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5c2e2bf822d4972cd5b836d6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elisabeth Moss","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elisabeth-moss"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"590a11ef8b51cf59fc42475e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"590a11ef8b51cf59fc42475e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-current-cinema"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Current Cinema","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-current-cinema"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Alex Ross Perry","url":"/tag/alex-ross-perry"},{"name":"Culture","url":"/tag/culture"},{"name":"Elisabeth Moss","url":"/tag/elisabeth-moss"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Anthony Lane","type":"author","title":"Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Everybody always said Walter shot him in the ball, but it wasnât true.

When the buildingâs owner hiked the rent on Sisterâs Community Hardware, the shop moved to Atlantic Avenue.

1692, the Massachusetts Bay Colony executed fourteen women, five men, and two dogs for witchcraft. The sorcery materialized in January. The first hanging took place in June, the last in September; a stark, stunned silence followed. Although we will never know the exact number of those formally charged with having âwickedly, maliciously, and feloniouslyâ engaged in sorcery, somewhere between a hundred and forty-four and a hundred and eighty-five witches and wizards were named in twenty-five villages and towns. The youngest was five; the eldest nearly eighty. Husbands implicated wives; nephews their aunts; daughters their mothers; siblings each other. One minister discovered that he was related to no fewer than twenty witches."],["p","The population of New England at that time would fit into Yankee Stadium today. Nearly to a person, they were Puritans. Having suffered for their faith, they had sailed to North America to worship âwith more purity and less peril than they could do in the country where they were,â as a clergyman at the center of the crisis later explained. On a providential mission, they hoped to begin history anew; they had the advantage of building a civilization from scratch. Like any oppressed people, they defined themselves by what offended them, which would give New England its gritty flavor and, it has been argued, America its independence."],["p","New England delivered greater purity but also introduced fresh perils. Stretching from Marthaâs Vineyard to Nova Scotia and incorporating parts of present-day Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine, it perched on the edge of a wilderness. That was a precarious position well before 1692, when the colony teetered between governments, or, more exactly, as a Boston merchant put it, âbetween government and no government.â The settlers unseated their royal governor in a deft 1689 military coup. They had endured without a charter for eight years."],["p","From the start, the colonists tangled with that American staple, the swarthy terrorist in the back yard. Without a knock or a greeting, four armed Indians might appear in your parlor to warm themselves by the fire, propositioning you, while you cowered in the corner with your knitting. You could return from a trip to Boston to find your house in ashes and your family taken captive. The Indians skulked, they lurked, they flitted, they committed atrocitiesâand they vanished. âOur men could see no enemy to shoot at,â a Cambridge major general lamented."],["p","King Philipâs War, a fifteen-month contest between the settlers and the Native Americans, had ended in 1676. It obliterated a third of New Englandâs towns, pulverized its economy, and claimed ten per cent of the adult male population. Every Bay Colony resident lost a friend or a relative; all knew of a dismemberment or an abduction. By 1692, another Indian war had begun to take shape, with a series of grisly raids by the Wabanaki and their French allies. The frontier had recently moved to within fifty miles of Salem."],["p","From the pulpit came reminders of New Englandâs many depredations. The wilderness qualified as a sort of âdevilâs denâ; since the time of Moses, the prince of darkness had thrived there. He was hardly pleased to be displaced by a convoy of Puritans. He was in fact stark raving mad about it, preached Cotton Mather, the brilliant twenty-nine-year-old Boston minister. What, exactly, did an army of devils look like? Imagine âvast regiments of cruel and bloody French dragoons,â Mather instructed his North Church parishioners, and they would understand. He routinely muddied the zoological waters: Indians comported themselves like roaring lions or savage bears, Quakers like âgrievous wolves.â The French, âdragons of the wilderness,â completed the diabolical menagerie. Given the symbiotic relationship of an oppressed people and an inhospitable landscape, it was from there but a short step to a colluding axis of evil."],["p","The men who catalogued those dangersâwho could discern a line of Revelation in a hailstormâprotected against them, spiritually and politically. They assisted in coups and installed regimes. Where witches were concerned, they deferred to the Biblical injunction: âThou shalt not suffer a witch to live,â Exodus commands. The most literate men in Massachusetts in 1692 were also the most literal. Among them, few probed the subject of witchcraft as intently as did the lanky, light-haired Mather, who had entered Harvard at eleven and preached his first sermon at sixteen. He knew that the hidden world was there somewhere. He would relinquish no tool to exhibit it."],["p","Mather shared the North Church pulpit with his illustrious father, Increase Mather. The president of Harvard, Increase was New Englandâs best-known and most prolific minister. (His son would eventually eclipse him on both counts, publishing four hundred and thirty-seven books, twenty-six of them in the next four years.) The elder Mather was returning from England that spring with a new charter. The fruit of three yearsâ negotiation, it promised at last to deliver Massachusetts from chaos.

isolated settlements, in smoky, fire-lit homes, New Englanders lived very much in the dark, where one listens more acutely, feels most passionately, and imagines most vividly, where the sacred and the occult thrive. The seventeenth-century sky was crow black, pitch-black, Bible black, so black that it could be difficult at night to keep to the path, so black that a line of trees might freely migrate to another location, or that you might find yourself pursued by a rabid black hog, leaving you to crawl home on all fours, bloody and disoriented. Even the colonyâs less isolated outposts felt their fragility. A tempest blew the roof off one of the finest homes in Salem as its ten occupants slept. A church went flying, with its congregation inside."],["p","A visitor exaggerated when he reported that New Englanders could âneither drive a bargain, nor make a jest, without a text of Scripture at the end on it,â but he was not far off. If there was a book in the house, it was the Bible. The early modern American thought, breathed, dreamed, disciplined, bartered, and hallucinated in Biblical texts and imagery. St. John the Baptist might well turn up in a land dispute. A prisoner cited Deuteronomy 19:19 in his own defense. When a killer cat came flying in your windowâtaking hold of your throat and crushing your chest as you lay defenseless in your bedâyou scared it away by invoking the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

He did so especially during the arctic winter of 1691, when bread froze on Communion plates, ink in pens, sap in the fireplace. In tiny Salem village, the Reverend Samuel Parris preached to a chorus of rattling coughs and sniffles, to the shuffling of cruelly frostbitten feet. For everyoneâs comfort, he curtailed his afternoon sermon of January 3, 1692. It was too cold to go on."],["p","Weeks later, word got out that something was grievously wrong in the Parris household. The ministerâs eleven-year-old niece and nine-year-old daughter complained of bites and pinches by âinvisible agents.â Abigail and Betty launched into âfoolish, ridiculous speeches.â Their bodies shuddered and spun. They went limp or spasmodically rigid. They interrupted sermons and fell into trances.

1641, when the colonists established a legal code, the first capital crime was idolatry. The second was witchcraft. âIf any man or woman be a witch, that is, has or consults with a familiar spirit, they shall be put to death,â read the Massachusetts body of laws. Blasphemy came next, followed by murder, poisoning, and bestiality. In the years since, New England had indicted more than a hundred witches, about a quarter of them men. The first person to confess to having entered into a pact with Satan, a Connecticut servant, had prayed for his help with her chores. An assistant materialized to clear the ashes from the hearth and the hogs from the fields. The servant was indicted in 1648 for âfamiliarity with the devil.â Unable to resist a calamity, preternatural or otherwise, Cotton Mather disseminated an instructive account of her compact."],["p","In 1688, four exemplary Boston children, the sons and daughters of a devout Boston stonelayer named John Goodwin, suffered from a baffling disorder. âThey would bark at one another like dogs, and again purr like so many cats,â noted Mather, who observed Goodwinâs family and wrote of their afflictions in âMemorable Providences, Relating to Witchcraft and Possessionsâ the following year. (The 1689 volume was a salute to his fatherâs âIllustrious Providences,â a grab bag of apparitions and portents, published five years earlier.) The Goodwin children flew like geese, on one occasion for twenty feet. They recoiled from blows of invisible sticks, shrieked that they were sliced by knives or wrapped in chains. Jaws, wrists, necks flew out of joint. Parental reproof sent the children into agonies. Chores defied them. But ânothing in the world would so discompose them as a religious exercise,â Mather reported. Thirteen-year-old Martha could read an Oxford compendium of humor, although she seized up when handed a volume he deemed âprofitable and edifying,â or one with the name Mather on the cover."],["p","To observe her symptoms more closely, Mather that summer took Martha Goodwin into his home. She cantered, trotted, and galloped about the household on her âaeriel steed,â whistling through family prayer and pummelling anyone who attempted it in her presenceâthe worst house guest in history. She hurled books at Matherâs head. She read and reread his pages on her case, lampooning their author. The sauciness astonished him. âAnd she particularly told me,â Mather sputtered, four years before the Salem trials, âthat I should quickly come to disgrace by that history.â"],["p","The cause of Marthaâs afflictions was identified soon enough. The witch was the mother of a neighborhood laundress. On the stand, the defendant was unable adequately to recite the Lordâs Prayer, understood to be proof of guilt. She was hanged in November, 1688, on Boston Common."],["p","Samuel Parris, the Salem minister, would have known every detail of the Goodwin familyâs trials from Matherâs much reprinted âMemorable Providences.â The book included the pages Martha wildly ridiculed. The âagitations, writhings, tumblings, tossings, wallowings, foamingsâ in the parsonage were the same, only more acute. The girls cried that they were being stabbed with fine needles. Their skin burned. One disappeared halfway down a well. Their shrieks could be heard from a distance."],["p","Through February, Parris fasted and prayed. He consulted with fellow-clergymen. With cider and cakes, he and his wife entertained the well-wishers who crowded their home. They prayed ardently, gooseflesh rising on their arms. They sang Psalms. But when the minister had had enough of the âodd postures and antic gestures,â the deranged speeches, when it became clear that Scripture would not relieve the girlsâ preternatural symptoms, Parris called in the doctors."],["p","In 1692, a basic medical kit looked little different from an ancient Greek one, consisting as it did of beetleâs blood, fox lung, and dried dolphin heart. In plasters or powders, snails figured in many remedies. Salem village had one practicing physician that winter. He owned nine medical texts; he could likely read but not write. His surgical arsenal consisted of lances, razors, and saws. The doctor who had examined a seizing Groton girl a generation earlier initially diagnosed a stomach disorder. On a second visit, he refused to administer to her further. The distemper was diabolical in origin."],["p","Whoever examined Abigail and Betty arrived at the same conclusion. âThe evil handâ came as no surprise; the supernatural explanation was already the one on the street. The diagnosis likely terrified the girls, whose symptoms deteriorated. It may have gratified Reverend Parris. Witchcraft was portentous, a Puritan favorite. Never before had it broken out in a parsonage. The Devilâs appearance was nearly a badge of honor, further proof that New Englanders were the chosen people. No wonder Massachusetts was troubled by witches, Cotton Mather exulted: âWhere will the Devil show most malice but where he is hated, and hateth most?â The New England ministry had long been on the lookout for the apocalypse, imminent since the sixteen-fifties. The Book of Revelation predicted that the Devil would descend accompanied by âinfernal fiends.â If they were about, God could not be far behind."],["p","Soon the twelve-year-old daughter of a close friend of Parrisâs began to shudder and choke.

Any seventeenth-century New Englander could have told you. As workers of magic, witches and wizards extend as far back as recorded history. The witch as Salem conceived her materialized in the thirteenth century, when sorcery and heresy moved closer together. She came into her own with the Inquisition, as a popular myth yielded to a popular madness. The western Alps introduced her to lurid orgies. Germany launched her into the air. As the magician molted into the witch, she also became predominately female, inherently more wicked and more susceptible to satanic overtures. An influential fifteenth-century text compressed a shelf of classical sources to make its point: âWhen a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil.â As is often the case with questions of women and power, elucidations here verged on the paranormal. Though weak willed, women could emerge as dangerously, insatiably commanding."],["p","The English witch made the trip to North America largely intact. She signed her agreement with the Devil in blood, bore a mark on her body for her compact, and enchanted by way of charms, ointments, and poppets, doll-like effigies. Continental witches had more fun. They walked on their hands. They made pregnancies last for three years. They rode hyenas to bacchanals deep in the forest. They stole babies and penises. The Massachusetts witch disordered the barn and the kitchen. She seldom flew to illicit meetings, more common in Scandinavia and Scotland. Instead, she divined the contents of an unopened letter, spun suspiciously fine linen, survived falls down stairs, tipped hay from wagons, enchanted beer, or caused cattle to leap four feet off the ground. Witches could be muttering, contentious malcontents or inexplicably strong and unaccountably smart. They could commit the capital offense of having more wit than their neighbors, as a minister said of the third Massachusetts woman hanged for witchcraft, in 1656."],["p","Matters were murkier when it came to the wily figure with six thousand years of experience, the master of disguise who could cause things to appear and disappear, who knew your secrets and could make you believe things of yourself that were not true. He turned up in New England as a hybrid monkey, man, and rooster, or as a fast-moving turtle. Even Cotton Mather was unsure what language he spoke. He was a pervasive presence, however: the air pulsed with his minions. Typically in Massachusetts, he wore a high-crowned hat, as he had in an earlier Swedish invasion, which Mather documented in his 1689 book. Mather did not mention the brightly colored scarf that the Devil wound around his hat. Like the Swedish devilâs gartered stockings or red beard, it never turned up in New England."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EBy%20May%2C%201692%2C%20eight%20Salem%20girls%20had%20claimed%20to%20be%20enchanted%20by%20individuals%20whom%20most%20of%20them%20had%20never%20met.%20Several%20served%20as%20visionaries%3B%20relatives%20of%20the%20ailing%20made%20pilgrimages%20to%20consult%20with%20them.%20They%20might%20be%20only%20eleven%20or%20twelve%2C%20but%20under%20adult%20supervision%20they%20could%20explain%20how%20several%20head%20of%20cattle%20had%20frozen%20to%20death%2C%20several%20communities%20away%2C%20six%20years%20earlier.%20In%20the%20courtroom%2C%20they%20provided%20prophetic%20direction%2C%20cautioning%20that%20a%20suspect%20would%20soon%20topple%20a%20child%2C%20or%20cause%20a%20woman%20to%20levitate.%20Minutes%20later%2C%20the%20victim%E2%80%99s%20feet%20rose%20from%20the%20floor.%20With%20their%20help%2C%20at%20least%20sixty%20witches%20had%20been%20deposed%20and%20jailed%20by%20the%20end%20of%20the%20month%2C%20more%20than%20the%20Massachusetts%20prisons%20had%20ever%20accommodated.%20Those%20who%20had%20frozen%20through%20the%20winter%20began%20to%20roast%20in%20the%20sweltering%20spring.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20May%2027th%2C%20the%20new%20Massachusetts%20governor%2C%20Sir%20William%20Phips%2C%20established%20a%20special%20court%20to%20try%20the%20witchcraft%20cases.%20He%20assembled%20on%20the%20bench%20nine%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9Cpeople%20of%20the%20best%20prudence%20and%20figure%20that%20could%20be%20pitched%20upon.%E2%80%9D%20At%20its%20head%20he%20installed%20his%20lieutenant%20governor%2C%20sixty-year-old%20William%20Stoughton.%20A%20political%20shape-shifter%2C%20Stoughton%20had%20served%20in%20five%20prior%20Massachusetts%20regimes.%20He%20had%20helped%20to%20unseat%20the%20reviled%20royal%20governor%2C%20on%20whose%20council%20he%20sat%20and%20whose%20courts%20he%20headed.%20He%20possessed%20one%20of%20the%20finest%20legal%20minds%20in%20the%20colony.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20court%20met%20in%20early%20June%2C%20and%20sentenced%20the%20first%20witch%20to%20hang%20on%20the%20tenth.%20It%20also%20requested%20a%20bit%20of%20guidance.%20During%20the%20next%20days%2C%20twelve%20ministers%20conferred.%20Cotton%20Mather%20drafted%20their%20reply%2C%20a%20circumspect%2C%20eight-paragraph%20document%2C%20delivered%20mid-month.%20Acknowledging%20the%20enormity%20of%20the%20crisis%2C%20he%20issued%20a%20paean%20to%20good%20government.%20He%20urged%20%E2%80%9Cexquisite%20caution.%E2%80%9D%20He%20warned%20of%20the%20dangers%20posed%20to%20those%20%E2%80%9Cformerly%20of%20an%20unblemished%20reputation.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20the%20lines%20that%20surely%20received%20the%20greatest%20scrutiny%2C%20Mather%20reminded%20the%20justices%20that%20convictions%20should%20not%20rest%20purely%20on%20spectral%20evidence%E2%80%94evidence%20visible%20only%20to%20the%20enchanted%2C%20who%20conversed%20with%20the%20Devil%20or%20with%20his%20confederates.%20Mather%20would%20insist%20on%20the%20point%20throughout%20the%20summer.%20Other%20considerations%20must%20weigh%20against%20the%20suspected%20witch%2C%20%E2%80%9Cinasmuch%20as%20%E2%80%99tis%20an%20undoubted%20and%20a%20notorious%20thing%E2%80%9D%20that%20a%20devil%20might%20impersonate%20an%20innocent%2C%20even%20virtuous%2C%20man.%20Mather%20wondered%20whether%20the%20entire%20calamity%20might%20be%20resolved%20if%20the%20court%20discounted%20those%20testimonies.%20With%20a%20sweeping%20%E2%80%9Cnevertheless%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20word%20that%20figured%20in%20every%201692%20Mather%20statement%20on%20witchcraft%E2%80%94he%20then%20executed%20an%20about-face.%20Having%20advised%20%E2%80%9Cexquisite%20caution%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20endorsed%20a%20%E2%80%9Cspeedy%20and%20vigorous%20prosecution.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","By May, 1692, eight Salem girls had claimed to be enchanted by individuals whom most of them had never met. Several served as visionaries; relatives of the ailing made pilgrimages to consult with them. They might be only eleven or twelve, but under adult supervision they could explain how several head of cattle had frozen to death, several communities away, six years earlier. In the courtroom, they provided prophetic direction, cautioning that a suspect would soon topple a child, or cause a woman to levitate. Minutes later, the victimâs feet rose from the floor. With their help, at least sixty witches had been deposed and jailed by the end of the month, more than the Massachusetts prisons had ever accommodated. Those who had frozen through the winter began to roast in the sweltering spring."],["p","On May 27th, the new Massachusetts governor, Sir William Phips, established a special court to try the witchcraft cases. He assembled on the bench nine of the âpeople of the best prudence and figure that could be pitched upon.â At its head he installed his lieutenant governor, sixty-year-old William Stoughton. A political shape-shifter, Stoughton had served in five prior Massachusetts regimes. He had helped to unseat the reviled royal governor, on whose council he sat and whose courts he headed. He possessed one of the finest legal minds in the colony."],["p","The court met in early June, and sentenced the first witch to hang on the tenth. It also requested a bit of guidance. During the next days, twelve ministers conferred. Cotton Mather drafted their reply, a circumspect, eight-paragraph document, delivered mid-month. Acknowledging the enormity of the crisis, he issued a paean to good government. He urged âexquisite caution.â He warned of the dangers posed to those âformerly of an unblemished reputation.â"],["p","In the lines that surely received the greatest scrutiny, Mather reminded the justices that convictions should not rest purely on spectral evidenceâevidence visible only to the enchanted, who conversed with the Devil or with his confederates. Mather would insist on the point throughout the summer. Other considerations must weigh against the suspected witch, âinasmuch as âtis an undoubted and a notorious thingâ that a devil might impersonate an innocent, even virtuous, man. Mather wondered whether the entire calamity might be resolved if the court discounted those testimonies.

month later, Ann Foster, a seventy-two-year-old widow from neighboring Andover, submitted to the first of several Salem interrogations. Initially, she denied all involvement with sorcery. Soon enough, she began to unspool a fantastical tale. The Devil had appeared to her as an exotic bird. He promised prosperity, along with the gift of afflicting at a glance. She had not seen him in six months, but her ill-tempered neighbor, Martha Carrier, had been in touch on his behalf."],["p","At Carrierâs direction, Foster had bewitched several children and a hog. She worked her sorcery with poppets. Carrier had announced a Devilâs Sabbath in May, arranging their trip by air. There were twenty-five people in the meadow, where a former Salem village minister officiated. Three days later, from jail, Foster added a malfunctioning pole and a mishap to her account. The pole had snapped as the women flew, causing them to crash, Fosterâs leg crumpling beneath her."],["p","She appeared entirely coÃ¶perative, both in a jail interview with a minister and before her interrogators. The justices soon learned that Foster had failed to come clean, however. It seemed that she and Carrier had neither flown nor crashed alone on that Salem-bound pole: a third rider had travelled silently behind Foster. So divulged forty-year-old Mary Lacey, a newly arrested suspect, on July 20th. Foster had also withheld the details of a chilling ceremony. The Devil had baptized his recruits, dipping their heads in water, six at a time. He performed the sacrament in a nearby river, to which he had carried Lacey in his arms. On July 21st, Ann Foster appeared before the magistrates for the fourth time. That hearing was particularly sensational: Mary Lacey, who supplied the details missing from Fosterâs account, was her daughter."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b63fd57b86d47b169c733%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b63fd57b86d47b169c733%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b63fd57b86d47b169c733%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b63fd57b86d47b169c733"}]],["p","âDid not you know your daughter to be a witch?â one justice asked Foster. She did not, and seemed taken aback. Mary Warren, a pretty, twenty-year-old servant, helpfully chimed in, a less dramatic witness at Fosterâs hearing than she appeared on other occasions, when blood trickled from her mouth or spread across her bonnet. Warren shared with the court what a spectre had confided in her: Foster had recruited her own daughter. The authorities understood that she had done so about thirteen years earlier. Was that correct? âNo, and I know no more of my daughterâs being a witch than what day I shall die upon,â Foster replied, sounding as unequivocal as she had been on the details of the misbegotten Salem flight. A magistrate coaxed her: âYou cannot expect peace of conscience without a free confession.â Foster swore that if she knew anything more she would reveal it."],["p","At this, Mary Lacey was called. She berated her mother: âWe have forsaken Jesus Christ, and the Devil hath got hold of us. How shall we get clear of this evil one?â Under her breath, Foster began to pray. âWhat God do witches pray to?â a justice needled. âI cannot tell, the Lord help me,â the befuddled old woman replied, as her daughter delivered fresh details of their flight to the village green and of the satanic baptism. Her mother, Lacey revealed, rode first on the stick."],["p","Court officers removed the two older women and escorted Laceyâs seventeen-year-old daughter, Mary Lacey, Jr., into the room. Mary Warren fell at once into fits. At first, the younger Lacey was unhelpful. âWhere is my mother that made me a witch and I knew it not?â she cried, a yet more disturbing question than the one posed in June, when a suspect wondered whether she might be a witch and not know it. Asked to smile at Warren without hurting her, Mary Lacey failed. Warren collapsed to the floor. âDo you acknowledge now that you are a witch?â Lacey was asked. She could only agree, although she seemed to be working from a different definition: a recalcitrant child, she had caused her parents plenty of trouble. She had, she insisted, signed no diabolical pact."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20ideal%20Puritan%20girl%20was%20a%20sterling%20amalgam%20of%20modesty%2C%20piety%2C%20and%20tireless%20industry.%20She%20was%20to%20speak%20neither%20too%20soon%20nor%20too%20much.%20She%20read%20her%20Scripture%20twice%20daily.%20Increase%20Mather%20warned%20that%20youths%20who%20disregarded%20their%20mothers%20could%20expect%20to%20%E2%80%9Ccome%20to%20the%20gallows%2C%20and%20be%20hanged%20in%20gibbets%20for%20the%20ravens%20and%20eagles%20to%20feed%20upon%20them.%E2%80%9D%20The%20attention%20to%20a%20youngster%E2%80%99s%20spiritual%20state%20intensified%20at%20adolescence%2C%20when%20children%20became%20simultaneously%20more%20capable%20of%20reason%20and%20less%20reasonable.%20Fourteen%20was%20the%20dividing%20line%20in%20law%2C%20for%20slander%20among%20other%20matters.%20One%20was%20meant%20then%20to%20embrace%20sobriety%20and%20to%20%E2%80%9Cput%20away%20childish%20things%2C%E2%80%9D%20as%20a%20father%20reminded%20his%20Harvard-bound%20son.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20father%20was%20the%20master%20of%20the%20family%2C%20its%20soul%2C%20the%20governor%20of%20all%20the%20governed.%20He%20was%20often%20an%20active%20and%20engaged%20parent.%20He%20sat%20vigil%20in%20the%20sickroom.%20He%20fretted%20over%20his%20children%E2%80%99s%20bodies%20and%20souls.%20A%20majority%20of%20the%20bewitched%20girls%20had%20lost%20fathers%3B%20at%20least%20half%20were%20refugees%20from%20or%20had%20been%20orphaned%20by%20attacks%20in%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20last%20Indian%20war.%E2%80%9D%20Those%20absences%20were%20deeply%20felt.%20A%20roaring%20girl%20wrestled%20aloud%20with%20the%20demons%20who%20would%20assault%20her%20the%20following%20year%3A%20she%20was%20well%20aware%20that%20she%20was%20fatherless%E2%80%94how%20often%20did%20they%20need%20to%20remind%20her%20as%20much%3F%20But%20she%20was%20hardly%20an%20orphan.%20In%20a%20heated%2C%20one-sided%20conversation%2C%20observed%20and%20preserved%20by%20Cotton%20Mather%2C%20the%20seventeen-year-old%20admonished%20her%20tormentors%2C%20%E2%80%9CI%20have%20God%20for%20my%20father%20and%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20question%20but%20he%E2%80%99ll%20provide%20well%20for%20me.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThe%20justices%20reminded%20Mary%20Lacey%2C%20Jr.%2C%20that%20if%20she%20desired%20to%20be%20saved%20by%20Christ%20she%20would%20confess.%20%E2%80%9CShe%20then%20proceeded%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20court%20reporter%20noted.%20She%20was%20more%20profligate%20with%20details%20than%20her%20mother%20or%20her%20grandmother%20had%20been.%20It%20was%20a%20hallmark%20of%20Salem%20that%20the%20younger%20generation%E2%80%94Cotton%20Mather%20included%E2%80%94could%20be%20relied%20on%20for%20the%20most%20luxuriant%20reports.%20It%20appeared%20easier%20to%20describe%20satanic%20escapades%20when%20an%20adolescent%20had%20already%20been%20told%2C%20or%20believed%2C%20that%20she%20cavorted%20with%20the%20Devil.%20The%20record%20allows%20a%20fleeting%20glimpse%20of%20Mary%E2%80%99s%20sense%20of%20herself.%20%E2%80%9CI%20have%20been%20a%20disobed%E2%80%94%E2%80%9D%20she%20began%2C%20after%20which%20the%20page%20is%20torn.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The ideal Puritan girl was a sterling amalgam of modesty, piety, and tireless industry.

A roaring girl wrestled aloud with the demons who would assault her the following year: she was well aware that she was fatherlessâhow often did they need to remind her as much? But she was hardly an orphan.

It was a hallmark of Salem that the younger generationâCotton Mather includedâcould be relied on for the most luxuriant reports. It appeared easier to describe satanic escapades when an adolescent had already been told, or believed, that she cavorted with the Devil. The record allows a fleeting glimpse of Maryâs sense of herself. âI have been a disobedââ she began, after which the page is torn."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EFollowing%20Mary%E2%80%99s%20testimony%2C%20her%20mother%20was%20returned%20to%20the%20room.%20The%20older%20woman%20had%20so%20often%20scolded%20that%20the%20Devil%20should%20fetch%20her%20away.%20Her%20wish%20had%20come%20true!%20Tears%20streaming%20down%20her%20face%2C%20the%20teen-ager%20now%20managed%20a%20spot%20of%20revenge%3A%20%E2%80%9COh%2C%20mother%2C%20why%20did%20you%20give%20me%20to%20the%20Devil%20twice%20or%20thrice%20over%3F%E2%80%9D%20Mary%20sobbed.%20She%20prayed%20that%20the%20Lord%20might%20expose%20all%20the%20witches.%20Officials%20led%20in%20her%20grandmother%3B%20three%20generations%20of%20enchantresses%20stood%20before%20the%20justices.%20Mary%20continued%20her%20rant%3A%20%E2%80%9COh%2C%20grandmother%2C%20why%20did%20you%20give%20me%20to%20the%20Devil%3F%20Why%20did%20you%20persuade%20me%20and%2C%20oh%2C%20grandmother%2C%20do%20not%20you%20deny%20it.%20You%20have%20been%20a%20very%20bad%20woman%20in%20your%20time.%E2%80%9D%20The%20three%20returned%20to%20jail%20as%20a%20clutch%20of%20warrants%20made%20their%20way%20to%20Andover.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Following Maryâs testimony, her mother was returned to the room.

Certain patterns emerged as well. To cast aspersions on a bewitched girl, to visit oneâs imprisoned spouse too regularly, was to risk accusation. It bordered on heresy to question the validity of witchcraft, the legitimacy of the evidence, or the wisdom of the court. The skeptic was a marked man. It could be wise to name names before anyone mentioned yours. It was safer to be afflicted than accused. Increasingly, you slept under the same roof, if not in the same bed, as your accuser."],["p","Bewitched women choked with fits, whereas menâwho stepped forward only once the trials had begunâtended to submit to paralyzing bedroom visits. Imputations proved impossible to outrun. The word of two ministers could not save an accused parishioner. Neither age, fortune, gender, nor church membership offered immunity; prominent men stood accused alongside homeless five-year-old girls. No one ever suffered afflictions without being able to name a witch. Many braced for a knock at the door."],["p","The court met again early in August, when three men were convicted: George Jacobs, an elderly farmer; John Willard, a much younger one; and John Proctor, the first village man to have been accused. In Cotton Matherâs first Thursday sermon that month, he addressed the trial that all of Massachusetts awaited. Tipping his hand a little, he called once for compassion for the accused, twice for pity for the justices. They were, after all, up against the greatest sophist in existence. They labored to restore the innocent while excising the diabolical; it made for a hazardous operation. The following day, Mather wrote excitedly to an uncle in Plymouth. God was working in miracles. No sooner had they executed five witchesâall impudently protesting their innocenceâthan God had dispatched the Andover witches, who offered âa most ample, surprising, amazing confession of all their villainies,â acknowledging the five executed that had been their confederates, and naming many more.

demonic mastermind was a minister in his early forties named George Burroughs. He had grown up in Maryland and graduated from Harvard in 1670, narrowly missing Samuel Parris. He was in his late twenties when he first arrived in Salem village, where he spent three contentious years. He was never ordained. Before and after that tenure, Burroughs served on the vulnerable Maine frontier. During a 1689 raid, he had joined in a seven-hour battle, waged in a field and an orchard. A veteran Boston militia captain lauded the Reverend for his unexpected role. The assault cost the settlers dearly; two hundred and fifty of them were killed or taken captive. Twice widowed, Burroughs retreated down the coast to Wells, eighty miles north of Boston. From a lice-infested garrison, he several times in the winter of 1692 appealed to the colonial authorities, who had withdrawn troops from the frontier, for clothing and provisions. The enemy lurked outside. They could not hold out for long."],["p","Burroughsâs spectre had been terrifying Salem villagers since April, when he first choked the twelve-year-old daughter of the Parris stalwart. He nearly tore her to pieces, bragging afterward that he outranked a wizardâhe was a conjurer. (Days later, he introduced himself with the same credentials to Parrisâs niece, whom he also bewitched.) He had murdered several women andâevidently a secret agent, in the employ of the French and the Indiansâdispatched a number of frontier soldiers as well. His mission was a frightful one, he informed the twelve-year-old: he who should have been teaching children to fear God had now âcome to persuade poor creatures to give their souls to the Devil.â It was he who presided over the satanic Sabbaths."],["p","Sixteen people had given evidence at Burroughsâs preliminary hearing. Nearly twice as many testified at his trial. Eight confessed witches revealed that he had been promised a kingship in Satanâs reign. Nine witnesses accused the short, muscular ministerâa âvery puny man,â in the estimation of Cotton Matherâof feats that would have taxed a giant. (Mather provided the sole surviving account of the trial, although we have no evidence that he ever entered the courtroom.) âNone of us could do what he could do,â a forty-two-year-old Salem weaver recalled. He had attempted to lift a shotgun that Burroughs had fired but, even with both hands, could not steady the seven-foot weapon. Asked to account for his preternatural strength, Burroughs said that an Indian had assisted him in firing the musket. Lurking behind the testimony was what may have been the most pertinent charge against the former village minister: he had survived every Indian attack unscathed. Several of the bewitched had not been so lucky. Others who might have testified about the musket handling were dead."],["p","The girls delivered up their own reports with difficulty, falling into testimony-stopping trances, yelping that Burroughs bit them. They displayed their wounds for court officials, who inspected the ministerâs mouth. The imprints matched perfectly. Choking and thrashing stalled the proceedings; the court could do nothing but wait for the girls to recover. During one delay, Chief Justice Stoughton appealed to the defendant. What, he asked, did Burroughs think throttled them? The minister replied that he assumed it was the Devil. âHow comes the devil then to be so loath to have any testimony born against you?â Stoughton challenged. A brainteaser of a question, it left Burroughs without an answer."],["p","He was equally bewildered when ghosts began to flit about the overcrowded room. Some observers who were not bewitched saw them too. Directly before Burroughs, a girl recoiled from a horrible sight: she explained that she stared into the blood-red faces of his dead wives. The ghosts demanded justice. By no account an agreeable man, Burroughs managed to join abusive behavior at home with miraculous feats abroad. If those in the court did not know already that, as Mather had it, Burroughs âhad been famous for the barbarous use of his two late wives, all the country over,â they did soon enough. He monitored their correspondences. He made them swear never to reveal his secrets. He berated them days after they had given birth. All evidence pointed to the same conclusion: he was a bad man but a very good wizard."],["p","At one point, a former brother-in-law testified, Burroughs had vanished in the midst of a strawberry-picking expedition. His companions hollered for him in vain. They rode home to find that he had preceded them, on foot and with a full basket of berries. He had divined as well what was said about him in his absence. The Devil could not know as much, the brother-in-law protested, to which Burroughs replied, âMy God makes known your thoughts unto me.â Was it possible, the chief justice suggested, that a devil had fitted Burroughs into some sort of invisibility cloak, so that he might âgratify his own jealous humor, to hear what they said of himâ? Burroughsâs answer is lost; Mather deemed it not âworth considering.â The evidence dwarfed the objections. Burroughs does seem to have bungled his defense. He stumbled repeatedly, offering contradictory answersâa luxury afforded only the accusers. As for âhis tergiversations, contra-dictions, and falsehoods,â Mather chided, âthere never was a prisoner more eminent for them.â"],["p","Out of excuses, Burroughs extracted a paper from his pocket. He seemed to believe it a deal-clincher. He did not contest the validity of spectral evidence, as had others who came before the court, who did not care to be convicted for crimes they committed in someone elseâs imagination. Instead, Burroughs, reading from the paper, asserted that âthere neither are, nor ever were witches, that having made a compact with the Devil can send a Devil to torment other people at a distance.â It was the most objectionable thing he could have suggested. If diabolical compacts did not exist, if the Devil could not subcontract out his work to witches, the Court of Oyer and Terminer had sent six innocents to their deaths."],["p","A tussle ensued. Stoughtonâwho had graduated from Harvard around the time Burroughs was bornârecognized the lines at once. Burroughs had lifted them from the work of Thomas Ady. A leading English skeptic, Ady inveighed against âgroundless, fantastical doctrines,â fairy tales and old wivesâ tales, the results of middle-of-the-night imaginings, excessive drinking, and blows to the head. Though witches existed, they were rare. The Bible nowhere connected them with murder, or with imps, compacts, or flights through the air."],["p","Ady believed that witches were a convenient excuse for the ignorant physician. He suggested that when misfortune struck we should not struggle to recall who had last come to the door. Burroughs denied having borrowed the passage, then amended his answer. A visitor had passed him the text in manuscript. He had transcribed it. He had already several times agreed with the justices that witches plagued New England. It was too late for such a dangerous gambit."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b64016f669264efc13955%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b64016f669264efc13955%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b64016f669264efc13955%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b64016f669264efc13955"}]]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EEarly%20on%20the%20morning%20of%20August%2019th%2C%20the%20largest%20throng%20to%20date%20turned%20out%20to%20inspect%20the%20first%20men%20whom%20Massachusetts%20was%20to%20execute%20for%20witchcraft.%20Martha%20Carrier%20joined%20them%20on%20the%20trip%20to%20the%20gallows.%20As%20the%20cart%20creaked%20up%20the%20hill%2C%20George%20Burroughs%2C%20George%20Jacobs%2C%20John%20Proctor%2C%20and%20John%20Willard%20insisted%20that%20they%20had%20been%20falsely%20accused.%20They%20hoped%20that%20the%20real%20witches%20would%20soon%20be%20revealed.%20They%20%E2%80%9Cdeclared%20their%20wish%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20bystander%20reported%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthat%20their%20blood%20might%20be%20the%20last%20innocent%20blood%20shed%20upon%20that%20account.%E2%80%9D%20They%20remained%20%E2%80%9Csincere%2C%20upright%2C%20and%20sensible%20of%20their%20circumstances%2C%20on%20all%20accounts.%E2%80%9D%20They%20forgave%20their%20accusers%2C%20the%20justices%2C%20the%20jury%3B%20they%20prayed%20they%20might%20be%20pardoned%20for%20their%20actual%20sins.%20Cotton%20Mather%20journeyed%20to%20Salem%20for%20the%20execution.%20Some%20of%20the%20condemned%20appealed%20to%20him%20in%20heartrending%20terms.%20Would%20he%20help%20them%20to%20prepare%20spiritually%20for%20the%20journey%20ahead%3F%20It%20is%20unclear%20if%20he%20did%20so%20or%20if%20he%20held%20the%20same%20hard%20line%20as%20the%20Salem%20town%20minister%2C%20who%20did%20not%20pray%20with%20witches.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBurroughs%20appears%20to%20have%20climbed%20the%20ladder%20first.%20With%20composure%2C%20he%20paused%20midway%20to%20offer%20what%20many%20expected%20to%20be%20a%20long-delayed%20confession.%20A%20wisp%20of%20his%20former%20self%20after%20fourteen%20weeks%20in%20a%20dungeon%2C%20he%20remained%20a%20contrarian.%20Perched%20above%20a%20crowd%20that%20included%20his%20former%20in-laws%20and%20parishioners%2C%20a%20noose%20around%20his%20neck%2C%20he%20delivered%20an%20impassioned%20speech.%20With%20his%20last%20breaths%2C%20Burroughs%20entrusted%20himself%20to%20the%20Almighty.%20Tears%20rolled%20down%20cheeks%20all%20around%20before%20he%20concluded%20with%20some%20disquieting%20lines.%20%E2%80%9COur%20Father%2C%20who%20art%20in%20Heaven%2C%E2%80%9D%20Burroughs%20began%2C%20continuing%2C%20from%20the%20ladder%2C%20with%20a%20blunder-free%20recitation%20of%20the%20Lord%E2%80%99s%20Prayer%E2%80%94an%20impossible%20feat%20for%20a%20wizard%2C%20one%20that%20any%20number%20of%20other%20suspects%20had%20not%20managed.%20For%20a%20few%20moments%2C%20it%20seemed%20as%20if%20the%20crowd%20would%20obstruct%20the%20execution.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EMinutes%20later%2C%20the%20minister%20dangled%20from%20a%20roughly%20finished%20beam.%20The%20life%20had%20not%20gone%20from%20his%20body%20when%20Mather%2C%20on%20horseback%2C%20pressed%20forward%20to%20smother%20the%20sparks%20of%20discontent.%20He%20reminded%20the%20spectators%20that%20Burroughs%20had%20never%20been%20ordained.%20(That%20was%20also%20true%20of%20others%20on%20the%20hill%20that%20day%2C%20but%20at%20least%20made%20the%20dying%20minister%20seem%20unorthodox.)%20What%20better%20disguise%20might%20the%20Devil%20choose%20on%20such%20an%20occasion%2C%20Mather%20challenged%2C%20than%20to%20masquerade%20as%20%E2%80%9Can%20angel%20of%20light%E2%80%9D%3F%20To%20the%20last%2C%20George%20Burroughs%20was%20condemned%20for%20his%20gifts.%20The%20protests%20quieted%2C%20as%20did%20the%20minister%20hanging%20in%20midair.%20He%20may%20have%20heard%20a%20portion%20of%20Mather%E2%80%99s%20remarks.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Early on the morning of August 19th, the largest throng to date turned out to inspect the first men whom Massachusetts was to execute for witchcraft. Martha Carrier joined them on the trip to the gallows. As the cart creaked up the hill, George Burroughs, George Jacobs, John Proctor, and John Willard insisted that they had been falsely accused. They hoped that the real witches would soon be revealed. They âdeclared their wish,â a bystander reported, âthat their blood might be the last innocent blood shed upon that account.â They remained âsincere, upright, and sensible of their circumstances, on all accounts.â They forgave their accusers, the justices, the jury; they prayed they might be pardoned for their actual sins. Cotton Mather journeyed to Salem for the execution. Some of the condemned appealed to him in heartrending terms. Would he help them to prepare spiritually for the journey ahead? It is unclear if he did so or if he held the same hard line as the Salem town minister, who did not pray with witches."],["p","Burroughs appears to have climbed the ladder first. With composure, he paused midway to offer what many expected to be a long-delayed confession. A wisp of his former self after fourteen weeks in a dungeon, he remained a contrarian. Perched above a crowd that included his former in-laws and parishioners, a noose around his neck, he delivered an impassioned speech. With his last breaths, Burroughs entrusted himself to the Almighty. Tears rolled down cheeks all around before he concluded with some disquieting lines. âOur Father, who art in Heaven,â Burroughs began, continuing, from the ladder, with a blunder-free recitation of the Lordâs Prayerâan impossible feat for a wizard, one that any number of other suspects had not managed. For a few moments, it seemed as if the crowd would obstruct the execution."],["p","Minutes later, the minister dangled from a roughly finished beam. The life had not gone from his body when Mather, on horseback, pressed forward to smother the sparks of discontent. He reminded the spectators that Burroughs had never been ordained. (That was also true of others on the hill that day, but at least made the dying minister seem unorthodox.) What better disguise might the Devil choose on such an occasion, Mather challenged, than to masquerade as âan angel of lightâ? To the last, George Burroughs was condemned for his gifts. The protests quieted, as did the minister hanging in midair. He may have heard a portion of Matherâs remarks."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20execution%20of%20a%20beguiling%2C%20Scripture-spouting%20minister%2C%20protesting%20his%20innocence%20to%20the%20end%2C%20created%20nearly%20as%20much%20disquiet%20as%20had%20the%20idea%20that%20a%20beguiling%2C%20Scripture-spouting%20minister%20recruited%20for%20the%20Devil.%20It%20raised%20qualms%20about%20the%20court%20and%20on%20the%20bench.%20Several%20of%20the%20justices%20soon%20allowed%20that%20their%20methods%20had%20been%20%E2%80%9Ctoo%20violent%20and%20not%20grounded%20upon%20a%20right%20foundation%E2%80%9D%3B%20were%20they%20to%20sit%20again%2C%20they%20would%20proceed%20differently.%20And%20it%20sent%20Cotton%20Mather%20to%20his%20desk.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOn%20September%202nd%2C%20he%20wrote%20to%20the%20chief%20justice.%20Already%2C%20Mather%20claimed%2C%20he%20had%20done%20far%20more%20behind%20the%20scenes%20than%20Stoughton%20could%20possibly%20know.%20He%20had%20been%20fasting%20almost%20weekly%20through%20the%20summer%20for%20an%20end%20to%20the%20sulfurous%20assault.%20He%20felt%20that%20the%20Massachusetts%20ministers%20ought%20to%20support%20the%20court%20in%20its%20weighty%2C%20worthy%20task%3B%20none%20had%20sufficiently%20done%20so.%20He%20volunteered%20to%20step%20into%20the%20breach%2C%20to%20%E2%80%9Cflatten%20that%20fury%2C%20which%20we%20now%20much%20turn%20upon%20one%20another.%E2%80%9D%20He%20had%20begun%20to%20write%20up%20a%20little%20something%2C%20%E2%80%9Cto%20set%20our%20calamity%20in%20as%20true%20a%20light%20as%20I%20can.%E2%80%9D%20With%20this%20new%20book%2C%20he%20proposed%20to%20dispel%20any%20doubts%20that%20innocents%20were%20in%20danger%2C%20a%20passage%20he%20underlined.%20Mather%20promised%20to%20submit%20his%20narrative%20to%20Stoughton%2C%20so%20that%20%E2%80%9Cthere%20may%20not%20be%20one%20word%20out%20of%20point.%E2%80%9D%20Might%20the%20chief%20justice%20and%20his%20colleagues%20sign%20off%20on%20his%20endeavor%2C%20which%20would%20remind%20the%20people%20of%20their%20duties%20in%20such%20a%20crisis%3F%20In%20a%20singular%20valediction%2C%20Mather%20wished%20Stoughton%20%E2%80%9Csuccess%20in%20your%20noble%20encounters%20with%20Hell.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIncrease%20Mather%2C%20too%2C%20was%20at%20work%20on%20a%20book.%20As%20father%20and%20son%20wrote%2C%20confessions%20and%20concerns%20multiplied.%20Reports%20circulated%20that%20seven%20hundred%20witches%20preyed%20on%20Massachusetts.%20A%20prominent%20Bostonian%20carried%20his%20ailing%20child%20the%20twenty%20miles%20to%20Salem%2C%20the%20Lourdes%20of%20New%20England%2C%20to%20be%20evaluated%20by%20the%20village%20girls%2C%20incurring%20the%20wrath%20of%20Increase%20Mather.%20Was%20there%20%E2%80%9Cnot%20a%20God%20in%20Boston%2C%E2%80%9D%20he%20exploded%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthat%20he%20should%20go%20to%20the%20Devil%20in%20Salem%20for%20advice%3F%E2%80%9D%20Things%20were%20wholly%20out%20of%20hand%20when%20a%20Boston%20divine%20was%20up%20against%20an%20adolescent%20oracle.%20On%20October%204th%2C%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20seven%20suspects%2C%20all%20under%20the%20age%20of%20eighteen%2C%20went%20home%20on%20bail.%20Among%20the%20eldest%20was%20Mary%20Lacey%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Ann%20Foster%E2%80%99s%20headstrong%20granddaughter.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CI%20found%20this%20province%20miserably%20harassed%20with%20a%20most%20horrible%20witchcraft%2C%E2%80%9D%20Governor%20Phips%20wrote%20on%20October%2012th%2C%20in%20his%20first%20report%20to%20London%20on%20the%20supernatural%20plague.%20He%20sounded%20as%20if%20he%20were%20writing%20from%20Sweden%20rather%20than%20from%20Boston%2C%20borrowing%20Mather%E2%80%99s%20details%20of%20that%20infestation.%20Grappling%20with%20the%20future%20of%20the%20court%2C%20which%20was%20scheduled%20to%20reconvene%20in%20two%20weeks%2C%20he%20insisted%20that%20the%20justices%20had%20always%20ruled%20with%20empirical%20evidence%2C%20but%20admitted%20that%20many%20now%20condemned%20their%20work.%20He%20placed%20a%20ban%20on%20witchcraft%20books.%20%E2%80%9CI%20saw%20a%20likelihood%20of%20kindling%20an%20inextinguishable%20flame%20if%20I%20should%20admit%20any%20public%20and%20open%20contests%2C%E2%80%9D%20Phips%20explained.%20That%20ban%20applied%20only%20to%20volumes%20that%20did%20not%20bear%20the%20name%20Mather%20on%20the%20cover.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Invisible%20World%E2%80%9D%20soon%20slipped%20into%20print%2C%20followed%20by%20Increase%20Mather%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9CCases%20of%20Conscience%2C%E2%80%9D%20both%20artfully%20postdated%20to%201693.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","The execution of a beguiling, Scripture-spouting minister, protesting his innocence to the end, created nearly as much disquiet as had the idea that a beguiling, Scripture-spouting minister recruited for the Devil. It raised qualms about the court and on the bench. Several of the justices soon allowed that their methods had been âtoo violent and not grounded upon a right foundationâ; were they to sit again, they would proceed differently. And it sent Cotton Mather to his desk."],["p","On September 2nd, he wrote to the chief justice. Already, Mather claimed, he had done far more behind the scenes than Stoughton could possibly know. He had been fasting almost weekly through the summer for an end to the sulfurous assault. He felt that the Massachusetts ministers ought to support the court in its weighty, worthy task; none had sufficiently done so. He volunteered to step into the breach, to âflatten that fury, which we now much turn upon one another.â He had begun to write up a little something, âto set our calamity in as true a light as I can.â With this new book, he proposed to dispel any doubts that innocents were in danger, a passage he underlined. Mather promised to submit his narrative to Stoughton, so that âthere may not be one word out of point.â Might the chief justice and his colleagues sign off on his endeavor, which would remind the people of their duties in such a crisis? In a singular valediction, Mather wished Stoughton âsuccess in your noble encounters with Hell.â"],["p","Increase Mather, too, was at work on a book. As father and son wrote, confessions and concerns multiplied. Reports circulated that seven hundred witches preyed on Massachusetts. A prominent Bostonian carried his ailing child the twenty miles to Salem, the Lourdes of New England, to be evaluated by the village girls, incurring the wrath of Increase Mather. Was there ânot a God in Boston,â he exploded, âthat he should go to the Devil in Salem for advice?â Things were wholly out of hand when a Boston divine was up against an adolescent oracle. On October 4th, for the first time, seven suspects, all under the age of eighteen, went home on bail. Among the eldest was Mary Lacey, Jr., Ann Fosterâs headstrong granddaughter."],["p","âI found this province miserably harassed with a most horrible witchcraft,â Governor Phips wrote on October 12th, in his first report to London on the supernatural plague. He sounded as if he were writing from Sweden rather than from Boston, borrowing Matherâs details of that infestation. Grappling with the future of the court, which was scheduled to reconvene in two weeks, he insisted that the justices had always ruled with empirical evidence, but admitted that many now condemned their work. He placed a ban on witchcraft books. âI saw a likelihood of kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admit any public and open contests,â Phips explained.

Wonders of the Invisible Worldâ was Americaâs first instant book. Garlanded in credentials, it advertised itself as having been âpublished by the special command of his Excellency the Governor.â Stoughton prefaced the volume, professing himself mildly surprised but immensely gratified by the work. What a timely account, so carefully and moderately composed! The chief justice was particularly grateful for Matherâs painstaking efforts, âconsidering the place that I hold in the Court of Oyer and Terminer, still laboring and proceeding in the trial of the persons accused and convicted for witchcraft.â Cotton Mather introduced the text with a tribute to his own courage. It was crucial that proper use be made of the âstupendous and prodigious things that are happening among us.â He did so only, he professed, because no one else volunteered. Weeks earlier, he had promised that his work would in no way interfere with that of two colleagues, whom he effectively cut off at the pass."],["p","What constituted sufficient proof of witchcraft? Father and son disagreed. Fifty-three-year-old Increase explained in âCasesâ that a âfree and voluntary confessionâ remained the gold standard. When credible men and women could attest to these things, the evidence was sound. He had no patience for mewling teen-age girls. One did not accept testimony from âa distracted person or of a possessed person in a case of murder, theft, felony of any sort, then neither may we do it in the case of witchcraft.â He cast a vote for clemency: âI would rather,â he wrote, âjudge a witch to be an honest woman than judge an honest woman as a witch.â"],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-left%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22cartoon%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522cartoon%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fcartoon%252F593b64038a032b339a0cd536%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%22593b64038a032b339a0cd536%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"cartoon","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cartoon%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fcartoon%2F593b64038a032b339a0cd536%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"593b64038a032b339a0cd536"}]],["p","Cotton Mather worried less about condemning an innocent than about allowing a witch to walk free. In âWonders,â he set out âto countermine the whole plot of the devil against New England.â He would not be surprised if the witchcraft reached even farther than was suspected, folding into his volume an account of a celebrated thirty-year-old English case, similar to Salemâs, except perhaps for a combusting toad. He chose that trial with reason: it was one in which spectral evidence had served to convict. Mather seems occasionally to have embroidered on court reports with details that appear nowhere in the surviving pages: the smell of brimstone, money raining down, a corner of a sheet ripped from a spectre. He otherwise adhered closely to the evidence while working some magic with his pages; no witnesses for the defense or petitions on their behalf appear in âWonders.â Mather included all the crowd-pleasing spectral stories, while issuing regular reminders that flights and pacts played only supporting roles in the convictions."],["p","He expressed his fervent hope that some of the witches in custody might prove innocent. They deserve âour most compassionate pity, till there be fuller evidences that they are less worthy of it.â Twenty pages later, he wrote of George Burroughs, âGlad I should have been if I had never known the name of this man.â His very initials revolted Mather. He wrote up five trial accounts in all; Burroughs alone was so powerful a wizard that he could not be named."],["p","As quickly as Mather worked, âThe Wonders of the Invisible Worldâ arrived as a case of too much too late. Conceived as a justification, billed as a felicitous accident, advertised in the authorâs own words, the volume read as a full-throated apologia. Governor Phips disbanded the witchcraft court at the end of October. Days after the bookâs publication, Mather wailed to his Plymouth-based uncle. A cataract of âunkindness, abuse, and reproachâ roared his way. People said lovely things to his face and hideous things behind his back. He meant only to tamp down dissent at a critical time. He found himself under fire for another infraction as well: filial disrespect. He had not endorsed his fatherâs volume. (Nor had his father endorsed his.) Among all the freewheeling accusations in 1692, not once had a father accused a son or a son implicated a father. He could see little to do but die."],["p","The new administration could ill afford a rift at this juncture; Increase Mather added a postscript to his pages. He remained convinced that witches roamed the land. He meant not to deny witchcraft but to make its prosecution more exact. He had declined to endorse his sonâs volume only out of an aversion to nepotism; he was most grateful to him for having established that no one had been convicted purely on spectral evidence. He too made a point of including Burroughs, who had, Increase Mather assured his readers, accomplished things that no one who âhas not a devil to be his familiar could perform.â Burroughs had deserved to hang. As Cotton Mather saw it, he had made a case for prosecuting the guilty, his father for protecting the innocent. Were they not saying the same thing? An early death no longer appealed."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EAyear%20after%20the%20trials%2C%20Cotton%20Mather%20treated%20two%20newly%20afflicted%20girls.%20A%20seventeen-year-old%20servant%20began%20to%20convulse%20after%20insulting%20a%20woman%20who%20had%20been%20imprisoned%20in%201692.%20The%20girl%20interrupted%20sermons%20and%20fell%20into%20trances.%20She%20went%20twelve%20days%20without%20food.%20She%20discoursed%20with%20spectres%20who%20tempted%20her%20with%20diabolical%20pacts%3B%20she%20shrieked%20so%20loudly%20that%20well-wishers%20fled%20the%20room%3B%20she%20tore%20a%20leaf%20from%20Mather%E2%80%99s%20Bible.%20He%20followed%20the%20same%20protocol%20he%20had%20with%20the%20Goodwins%2C%20four%20years%20and%20nineteen%20executions%20earlier%2C%20assembling%20groups%20to%20pray%20and%20to%20sing%20Psalms%20at%20her%20bedside.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EBoth%20girls%20eventually%20recovered.%20Mather%20devoted%20thirty-eight%20pages%20to%20the%20initial%20case%20but%20left%20them%20unpublished.%20Given%20the%20tenor%20of%20the%20times%2C%20he%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9CNo%20man%20in%20his%20wits%20would%20fully%20expose%20his%20thoughts%20unto%20them%2C%20till%20the%20charms%20which%20enrage%20the%20people%20are%20a%20little%20better%20dissipated.%E2%80%9D%20He%20did%20not%20care%20in%201693%20to%20cultivate%20what%2C%20centuries%20later%2C%20would%20be%20termed%20the%20paranoid%20strain%20in%20American%20politics%2C%20with%20its%20%E2%80%9Csense%20of%20heated%20exaggeration%2C%20suspiciousness%2C%20and%20conspiratorial%20fantasy.%E2%80%9D%20Political%20stability%20remained%20paramount.%20Mather%20did%2C%20however%2C%20retail%20the%20teen-ager%E2%80%99s%20report%20that%20Frenchmen%20and%20Indians%E2%80%94%E2%80%9Chorrid%20sorcerers%20and%20hellish%20conjurers%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94had%20colluded%20in%20Salem%20witchcraft.%20He%20insisted%20on%20it%20for%20years.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3E%E2%80%9CThere%20is%20no%20public%20calamity%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mather%20noted%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CWonders%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cbut%20some%20ill%20people%20will%20serve%20themselves%20of%20the%20sad%20providence%2C%20and%20make%20use%20of%20it%20for%20their%20own%20ends%2C%20as%20thieves%20when%20a%20house%20or%20town%20is%20on%20fire%2C%20will%20steal%20what%20they%20can.%E2%80%9D%20Twenty-eight%20years%20later%2C%20a%20smallpox%20epidemic%20raged%20through%20Boston.%20Cotton%20Mather%20faced%20down%20the%20entire%20medical%20establishment%20to%20advocate%20something%20that%20seemed%20every%20bit%20as%20dubious%20as%20spectral%20evidence%3A%20inoculation.%20He%20had%20studied%20medicine%20at%20Harvard.%20Over%20the%20decades%2C%20he%20had%20come%20better%20to%20understand%20infectious%20disease.%20Moving%20from%20imps%20and%20witches%20to%20germs%20and%20viruses%2C%20he%20at%20last%20located%20the%20devils%20we%20inhale%20with%20every%20breath.%20The%20battle%20turned%20so%20vitriolic%20that%20it%20dragged%20Salem%20out%20of%20hiding%3B%20Mather%20was%20bludgeoned%20for%20lunacy%20on%20two%20counts.%20Yet%20again%2C%20Massachusetts%20seemed%20to%20be%20in%20the%20grip%20of%20distemper.%20The%20people%20talked%2C%20he%20huffed%20in%20his%20diary%2C%20%E2%80%9Cnot%20only%20like%20idiots%20but%20also%20like%20fanaticks.%E2%80%9D%20He%20remained%20as%20steadfast%20on%20the%20subject%20of%20inoculation%20as%20he%20had%20been%20equivocal%20on%20witchcraft.%20In%20November%2C%201721%2C%20a%20homemade%20bomb%20came%20sailing%20in%20his%20window%20at%203%20%3Cem%20class%3D%5C%22small%5C%22%3Ea.m%3C%2Fem%3E.%20His%20reputation%20never%20recovered.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Ayear after the trials, Cotton Mather treated two newly afflicted girls. A seventeen-year-old servant began to convulse after insulting a woman who had been imprisoned in 1692. The girl interrupted sermons and fell into trances. She went twelve days without food. She discoursed with spectres who tempted her with diabolical pacts; she shrieked so loudly that well-wishers fled the room; she tore a leaf from Matherâs Bible. He followed the same protocol he had with the Goodwins, four years and nineteen executions earlier, assembling groups to pray and to sing Psalms at her bedside."],["p","Both girls eventually recovered. Mather devoted thirty-eight pages to the initial case but left them unpublished. Given the tenor of the times, he wrote, âNo man in his wits would fully expose his thoughts unto them, till the charms which enrage the people are a little better dissipated.â He did not care in 1693 to cultivate what, centuries later, would be termed the paranoid strain in American politics, with its âsense of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy.â Political stability remained paramount. Mather did, however, retail the teen-agerâs report that Frenchmen and Indiansââhorrid sorcerers and hellish conjurersââhad colluded in Salem witchcraft. He insisted on it for years."],["p","âThere is no public calamity,â Mather noted, in âWonders,â âbut some ill people will serve themselves of the sad providence, and make use of it for their own ends, as thieves when a house or town is on fire, will steal what they can.â Twenty-eight years later, a smallpox epidemic raged through Boston. Cotton Mather faced down the entire medical establishment to advocate something that seemed every bit as dubious as spectral evidence: inoculation. He had studied medicine at Harvard. Over the decades, he had come better to understand infectious disease. Moving from imps and witches to germs and viruses, he at last located the devils we inhale with every breath. The battle turned so vitriolic that it dragged Salem out of hiding; Mather was bludgeoned for lunacy on two counts. Yet again, Massachusetts seemed to be in the grip of distemper. The people talked, he huffed in his diary, ânot only like idiots but also like fanaticks.â He remained as steadfast on the subject of inoculation as he had been equivocal on witchcraft. In November, 1721, a homemade bomb came sailing in his window at 3 ",["em",{"class":"small"},"a.m"],". His reputation never recovered.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/the-witches-of-salem","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f407e716b454591b003","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Cotton

January of 1842, Ralph Waldo Emersonâs firstborn child, Waldo, contracted scarlet fever and died within a week. He was five. He had been his fatherâs exuberant companion, who had, Emerson wrote, âtouched with his lively curiosity every trivial fact & circumstance in the household.â Henry David Thoreau, who had lodged with the Emersons, âcharmed Waldo by the variety of toys whistles boats popguns & all kinds of instruments which he could make & mend.â The death was a shock to the entire village of Concord, Massachusetts. When the nine-year-old Louisa May Alcott came to the Emersonsâ door to ask about Waldo, she was greeted, she wrote, by an Emerson âworn with watching and changed by sorrow.â All he said was âChild, he is dead.â Alcott called it her âfirst glimpse of a great grief.â"],["p","But the grief did not feel real, or real enough, to Emerson. âI chiefly grieve that I cannot grieve,â he wrote in a letter the following week. The loss of Waldo spurred an essay, âExperience,â that contains one of the most startling passages in American literature:"],["blockquote",["p","The only thing grief has taught me, is to know how shallow it is. That, like all the rest, plays about the surface, and never introduces me into the reality, for contact with which, we would even pay the costly price of sons and lovers. Was it Boscovich who found out that bodies never come in contact? Well, souls never touch their objects. An innavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with. Grief too will make us idealists. In the death of my son, now more than two years ago, I seem to have lost a beautiful estate,âno more. I cannot get it nearer to me. If tomorrow I should be informed of the bankruptcy of my principal debtors, the loss of my property would be a great inconvenience to me, perhaps, for many years; but it would leave me as it found me,âneither better nor worse. So is it with this calamity: it does not touch me: some thing which I fancied was a part of me, which could not be torn away without tearing me, nor enlarged without enriching me, falls off from me, and leaves no scar. It was caducous. I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, nor carry me one step into real nature."]],["p","This seems nearly callous, but thatâs the point. Emerson had suffered tragic deaths before, and, partly as a result, had developed a theory of spiritual profit and loss: surely the greatest costs led to the richest benefits? When âa great man,â he wrote in âCompensation,â an earlier essay, is âpushed, tormented, defeated, he has a chance to learn something; he has been put on his wits, on his manhood; he has gained facts; learns his ignorance; is cured of the insanity of conceit; has got moderation and real skill.â But Waldoâs death was so profound that it went uncompensated, even by grief. It taught Emerson ânothingâ; it was almost as though his son had never existed. Unluckily, swiftly, even happily, life goes on, only mildly âinconveniencedâ by the most devastating loss imaginable."],["p","âExperienceâ has a knifeâs-edge, emergency intensity that is nowhere to be found in Emersonâs poems, collected in âRalph Waldo Emerson: The Major Poetryâ (Harvard), edited by Albert J. von Frank. Prose was a zone of fruitful conflict for Emerson, who began his public life writing sermons. He entered Harvard Divinity School in 1825, at the age of twenty-one, to prepare for a career in the Unitarian ministry. Soon he was struck by a painful eye disease, likely caused by tuberculosis, and submitted to two cataract operations. According to Robert D. Richardsonâs âEmerson: The Mind on Fire,â Emersonâs reading in Hume, and his knowledge of the âbrilliantly clever arguments of Cicero,â began to erode his faith. His days were âslipping past him, one by one, in an irrevocable procession,â Richardson writes. He knew that the âproper emotionâ wasnât humility or even skepticism but âwonder.â"],["p","Emersonâs essays are like wonder handbooks: they tell you where to find it, how to use it, what to do when it fails you. âNature,â âThe Poet,â âSelf-Reliance,â âCircles,â âExperienceâ: you can use these essays to become enchanted; many dejected secular people have gone to them regularly to see the world in renewed and refreshed terms of beauty. They outfit you for a walk in the woods or an ordinary morning. They are modular: you can remember bits of one, bits of another, mess up the order, mix and match. Their authority comes not from the Church or the ministry but from the power of their prose. Emerson must have realized that half of the people in church were there to hear language electrified by the preacher; his essays are, as Harold Bloom put it, âinterior oratory,â free-range sermons that make their own occasions."],["p","Emerson also wrote a poem about Waldo, âThrenody.â It is often quite beautiful, but it is dressed almost entirely in period costume. The period was the eighteen-forties, and the costume was woodsy, ânative,â and politely anti-European. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who returned from Europe to teach modern languages at Harvard, was considered a boldly American poet: he wrote epics about Miles Standish and the expulsion of the Acadians from Nova Scotia. To Emersonâs contemporaries, experimentation in poetry meant writing about âthe bobolink and the humble-beeâ rather than the English nightingale and the skylark, which, as Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Emily Dickinsonâs correspondent and early advocate, wrote, Americans âmight never have seen or heard anywhere.â"],["p","By these standards, âThrenody,â with its tableaux of American village life, is a masterpiece.

Those unforgettable âbirdlike heavingsâ of the childâs final breaths puncture a frigid silence known to anybody from Emersonâs neck of the woods. The image is borrowed from his journals, roused to this new formal occasion yet maintaining its fringe of untransformed anguish. But the poem quickly stifles its desperation in the prescribed comforts of noble sentiment and regular music."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EThe%20listlessness%20of%20Emerson%E2%80%99s%20poetry%20is%20surprising%2C%20given%20the%20veneration%20he%20expressed%20for%20the%20art.%20Some%20of%20his%20best%20prose%20is%20devoted%20to%20lobbying%20for%20the%20special%20advantages%20of%20poetry.%20These%20works%20are%20thrilling%20because%20they%20are%20written%20in%20thrilling%20sentences.%20This%20does%20not%20necessarily%20imply%20that%20Emerson%E2%80%99s%20poetry%20will%20be%20thrilling%2C%20though%20he%20must%20have%20intended%20his%20large%20claims%20for%20poetry%20to%20be%20tested%20on%20his%20own%20work.%20Like%20many%20of%20his%20essays%2C%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Poet%E2%80%9D%20was%20printed%20with%20an%20original%20short%20lyric%20as%20its%20epigraph.%20The%20mediocrity%20of%20these%20poem-epigraphs%20is%20often%20emphasized%20by%20the%20essays%E2%80%99%20attempts%20to%20honor%20them%20as%20superior%20forms%20of%20expression.%20It%20makes%20for%20a%20strangely%20rigged%20contest%20between%20turbocharged%20prose%20and%20the%20rickshaw%20verse%20it%20ostensibly%20reveres.%20Emerson%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cpoet%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94a%20%E2%80%9Ccomplete%20man%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20%E2%80%9Cman%20without%20impediment%2C%E2%80%9D%20a%20%E2%80%9Csayer%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cnamer%2C%E2%80%9D%20like%20Adam%E2%80%94would%20not%20have%20printed%20the%20lacklustre%20verses%20appended%20to%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Poet%2C%E2%80%9D%20which%20venerate%20%E2%80%9COlympian%20bards%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cdivine%20ideas%E2%80%9D%20with%20rhymes%20as%20bouncy%20as%20a%20Super%20Ball.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20%E2%80%9CMerlin%20I%2C%E2%80%9D%20written%2C%20like%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Poet%2C%E2%80%9D%20in%20the%20eighteen-forties%2C%20Emerson%20plays%20the%20unwinnable%20game%20of%20arguing%20in%20metre%20against%20metre%20and%20in%20rhyme%20against%20rhyme%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThy%20trivial%20harp%20will%20never%20please%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EOr%20fill%20my%20craving%20ear%3B%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIts%20chords%20should%20ring%20as%20blows%20the%20breeze%2C%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EFree%2C%20peremptory%2C%20clear.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENo%20jingling%20serenader%E2%80%99s%20art%2C%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ENor%20tinkle%20of%20piano%20strings%2C%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3ECan%20make%20the%20wild%20blood%20start%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20its%20mystic%20springs.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEmerson%20kept%20an%20Aeolian%20harp%20in%20a%20window%20of%20his%20house.%20He%20intended%20to%20build%20in%20verse%20its%20equivalent%2C%20an%20instrument%20that%20nature%20could%20play.%20But%20the%20instrument%20itself%20was%20old-fashioned%2C%20gaudy%2C%20and%20domestic.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EEmerson%E2%80%99s%20ideas%20were%20obviously%20badly%20served%20by%20the%20rickety%20verse%20structures%20he%20built%20for%20them.%20Seeing%20them%20strain%20and%20buckle%20under%20the%20weight%20of%20his%20mind%20and%20ambition%20led%20him%2C%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Poet%2C%E2%80%9D%20to%20call%20not%20only%20for%20a%20new%20kind%20of%20poem%2C%20which%2C%20at%20least%20in%20theory%2C%20he%20could%20have%20written%2C%20but%20for%20a%20wholly%20new%20kind%20of%20person%2C%20a%20person%20he%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20and%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20become.%20His%20best%20poems%E2%80%94%E2%80%9CEach%20and%20All%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9CBrahma%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Rhodora%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Snow-Storm%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94are%20refinements%20of%20oratory%20to%20the%20special%20rhetorical%20technologies%20of%20poetry.%20But%20his%20quicksilver%20prose%20%3Cem%3Ewas%3C%2Fem%3E%20poetry%2C%20its%20sentences%20like%20signal%20flares%20launched%20one%20after%20another%20into%20the%20ether.%20What%20he%20says%20about%20the%20poet%20is%20truer%20of%20those%20astonishing%20prose%20performances%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EFor%20it%20is%20not%20metres%2C%20but%20a%20metre-making%20argument%2C%20that%20makes%20a%20poem%2C%E2%80%94a%20thought%20so%20passionate%20and%20alive%2C%20that%2C%20like%20the%20spirit%20of%20a%20plant%20or%20an%20animal%2C%20it%20has%20an%20architecture%20of%20its%20own%2C%20and%20adorns%20nature%20with%20a%20new%20thing.%20The%20thought%20and%20the%20form%20are%20equal%20in%20the%20order%20of%20time%2C%20but%20in%20the%20order%20of%20genesis%20the%20thought%20is%20prior%20to%20the%20form.%20The%20poet%20has%20a%20new%20thought%3A%20he%20has%20a%20whole%20new%20experience%20to%20unfold%3B%20he%20will%20tell%20us%20how%20it%20was%20with%20him%2C%20and%20all%20men%20will%20be%20the%20richer%20in%20his%20fortune.%20For%2C%20the%20experience%20of%20each%20new%20age%20requires%20a%20new%20confession%2C%20and%20the%20world%20seems%20always%20waiting%20for%20its%20poet.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EThis%20passage%2C%20like%20so%20many%20in%20his%20great%20essays%2C%20describes%20itself%2C%20its%20own%20idiosyncratic%20%E2%80%9Carchitecture.%E2%80%9D%20This%20is%

listlessness of Emersonâs poetry is surprising, given the veneration he expressed for the art. Some of his best prose is devoted to lobbying for the special advantages of poetry. These works are thrilling because they are written in thrilling sentences. This does not necessarily imply that Emersonâs poetry will be thrilling, though he must have intended his large claims for poetry to be tested on his own work. Like many of his essays, âThe Poetâ was printed with an original short lyric as its epigraph. The mediocrity of these poem-epigraphs is often emphasized by the essaysâ attempts to honor them as superior forms of expression. It makes for a strangely rigged contest between turbocharged prose and the rickshaw verse it ostensibly reveres. Emersonâs âpoetââa âcomplete man,â a âman without impediment,â a âsayerâ and ânamer,â like Adamâwould not have printed the lacklustre verses appended to âThe Poet,â which venerate âOlympian bardsâ and âdivine ideasâ with rhymes as bouncy as a Super Ball."],["p","In âMerlin I,â written, like âThe Poet,â in the eighteen-forties, Emerson plays the unwinnable game of arguing in metre against metre and in rhyme against rhyme:"],["blockquote",["p","Thy trivial harp will never please"],["p","Or fill my craving ear;"],["p","Its chords should ring as blows the breeze,"],["p","Free, peremptory, clear."],["p","No jingling serenaderâs art,"],["p","Nor tinkle of piano strings,"],["p","Can make the wild blood start"],["p","In its mystic springs."]],["p","Emerson kept an Aeolian harp in a window of his house. He intended to build in verse its equivalent, an instrument that nature could play. But the instrument itself was old-fashioned, gaudy, and domestic."],["p","Emersonâs ideas were obviously badly served by the rickety verse structures he built for them. Seeing them strain and buckle under the weight of his mind and ambition led him, in âThe Poet,â to call not only for a new kind of poem, which, at least in theory, he could have written, but for a wholly new kind of person, a person he wasnât and didnât want to become. His best poemsââEach and All,â âBrahma,â âThe Rhodora,â âThe Snow-Stormââare refinements of oratory to the special rhetorical technologies of poetry. But his quicksilver prose ",["em","was"]," poetry, its sentences like signal flares launched one after another into the ether. What he says about the poet is truer of those astonishing prose performances:"],["blockquote",["p","For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument, that makes a poem,âa thought so passionate and alive, that, like the spirit of a plant or an animal, it has an architecture of its own, and adorns nature with a new thing. The thought and the form are equal in the order of time, but in the order of genesis the thought is prior to the form. The poet has a new thought: he has a whole new experience to unfold; he will tell us how it was with him, and all men will be the richer in his fortune. For, the experience of each new age requires a new confession, and the world seems always waiting for its poet."]],["p","This passage, like so many in his great essays, describes itself, its own idiosyncratic âarchitecture.â This is what Emerson meant when he called for a literature of âinsight and not of tradition.â Each sentence is an innovation, âa new thing.â Emerson didnât want to write poems about the New World. He wanted poems to make the world new. It is fascinating, therefore, to see how he arranged for his own swift obsolescence. His poems sometimes feel intentionally slight, as though making way for the accelerating future, still at his back but quickly gaining on him. His prose was poetry by other means, calling for its own mirror image, a poetry whose âargumentâ trumped its forms."]],["inline-embed",{"type":"section","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22section%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cp%3EEmerson%20was%20not%20the%20poet%20he%20had%20in%20mind%20in%20%E2%80%9CThe%20Poet.%E2%80%9D%20In%201840%2C%20Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville%20had%20prophesied%20an%20American%20poetry%20free%20of%20%E2%80%9Clegendary%20lays%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Cold%20traditions%2C%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%9Csupernatural%20beings%2C%E2%80%9D%20masks%2C%20and%20personifications.%20Americans%20led%20%E2%80%9Cpetty%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Cinsipid%E2%80%9D%20lives%2C%20%E2%80%9Ccrowded%20with%20paltry%20interests%E2%80%9D%3A%20their%20lives%20were%20%E2%80%9Canti-poetic.%E2%80%9D%20The%20only%20subject%20possible%20for%20an%20American%20poet%20was%20humankind%3B%20luckily%2C%20as%20Tocqueville%20wrote%2C%20%E2%80%9Cthe%20poet%20needs%20no%20more.%E2%80%9D%20Emerson%2C%20who%20spent%20most%20of%20his%20life%20cultivating%20the%20aura%20of%20an%20elder%2C%20called%20for%20%E2%80%9Ca%20brood%20of%20Titans%E2%80%9D%20who%20would%20%E2%80%9Crun%20up%20the%20mountains%20of%20the%20West%20with%20the%20errand%20of%20genius%20and%20love.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20July%20of%201855%2C%20Emerson%20got%20the%20poet%20he%E2%80%99d%20been%20calling%20for.%20He%20picked%20up%20a%20parcel%20from%20the%20Concord%20post%20office%20which%20contained%20the%20first%20edition%20of%20%E2%80%9CLeaves%20of%20Grass%2C%E2%80%9D%20sent%20anonymously%20from%20Brooklyn%20by%20its%20author.%20The%20book%20was%20unsigned%2C%20though%20there%20was%20a%20frontispiece%20portrait%2C%20the%20name%20%E2%80%9CWalter%20Whitman%E2%80%9D%20on%20the%20copyright%20page%2C%20and%2C%20inside%2C%20the%20jubilant%20line%20%E2%80%9CWalt%20Whitman%2C%20an%20American%2C%20one%20of%20the%20roughs%2C%20a%20kosmos.%C2%A0%E2%80%9D%20After%20a%20little%20hunting%2C%20Emerson%20found%20Whitman%E2%80%99s%20name%20and%20the%20address%20of%20his%20distributor%20in%20a%20newspaper%20advertisement.%20He%20then%20wrote%20his%20famous%20letter%20to%20Whitman%2C%20welcoming%20him%20to%20immortality%3A%20%E2%80%9CI%20greet%20you%20at%20the%20beginning%20of%20a%20great%20career%2C%20which%20yet%20must%20have%20had%20a%20long%20foreground%20somewhere%20for%20such%20a%20start.%E2%80%9D%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EIn%20response%2C%20Whitman%20published%20the%20letter%20in%20the%20book%E2%80%99s%20next%20edition%2C%20along%20with%20twenty%20new%20poems%20and%20his%20own%20open%20letter%20to%20Emerson%20of%20several%20thousand%20words%20celebrating%20%E2%80%9Cthat%20vast%20basis%20of%20the%20supremacy%20of%20Individuality%E2%80%94that%20new%20moral%20American%20continent%E2%80%9D%20whose%20%E2%80%9Cshores%20you%20found%E2%80%9D%3A%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3Cblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EI%20say%20you%20have%20led%20The%20States%20there%E2%80%94have%20led%20Me%20there.%20I%20say%20that%20none%20has%20ever%20done%2C%20or%20ever%20can%20do%2C%20a%20greater%20deed%20for%20The%20States%2C%20than%20your%20deed.%20Others%20may%20line%20out%20the%20lines%2C%20build%20cities%2C%20work%20mines%2C%20break%20up%20farms%3B%20it%20is%20yours%20to%20have%20been%20the%20original%20true%20Captain%20who%20put%20to%20sea%2C%20intuitive%2C%20positive%2C%20rendering%20the%20first%20report%2C%20to%20be%20told%20less%20by%20any%20report%2C%20and%20more%20by%20the%20mariners%20of%20a%20thousand%20bays%2C%20in%20each%20tack%20of%20their%20arriving%20and%20departing%2C%20many%20years%20after%20you.%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%3C%2Fblockquote%3E%5Cn%3Cp%3EWhitman%20was%20a%20fact%20of%20American%20life%20from%20that%20moment%20forward.%20It%20took%20a%20little%20longer%20for%20an%20equally%20important%20disciple%20to%20surface%3A%20Emily%20Dickinson%2C%20who%20treasured%20an%20edition%20of%20Emerson%E2%80%99s%20poems%20given%20to%20her%20by%20an%20admirer%2C%20and%20whose%20brother%20and%20sister-in-law%2C%20Austin%20and%20Susan%20Dickinson%2C%20had%20hosted%20Emerson%20many%20times%20at%20their%20handsome%20house%2C%20the%20Evergreens%2C%20just%20across%20the%20field%20from%20her%20home.%20Of%20course%2C%20Dickinson%E2%80%99s%20poems%20sound%20nothing%20like%20Emerson%E2%80%99s.%20He%20provided%2C%20for%20the%20wild%20synaptic%20activity%20of%20his%20prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9s%2C%20the%20framework.%20He%20was%20their%20server.%20If%20Emerson%E2%80%99s%20poems%20had%20been%20just%20a%20little%20better%20than%20they%20were%2C%20we%20might%20not%20have%20American%20literature%20as%20we%20know%20it.%20Our%20greatest%20writers%2C%20seeing%20their%20own%20visions%20usurped%2C%20might%20have%20been%20content%20to%20remain%20his%20readers.%C2%A0%E2%99%A6%3C%2Fp%3E%5Cn%22%7D","ref":""},["p","Emerson was not the poet he had in mind in âThe Poet.â In 1840, Alexis de Tocqueville had prophesied an American poetry free of âlegendary lays,â âold traditions,â âsupernatural beings,â masks, and personifications. Americans led âpettyâ and âinsipidâ lives, âcrowded with paltry interestsâ: their lives were âanti-poetic.â The only subject possible for an American poet was humankind; luckily, as Tocqueville wrote, âthe poet needs no more.â Emerson, who spent most of his life cultivating the aura of an elder, called for âa brood of Titansâ who would ârun up the mountains of the West with the errand of genius and love.â"],["p","In July of 1855, Emerson got the poet heâd been calling for. He picked up a parcel from the Concord post office which contained the first edition of âLeaves of Grass,â sent anonymously from Brooklyn by its author. The book was unsigned, though there was a frontispiece portrait, the name âWalter Whitmanâ on the copyright page, and, inside, the jubilant line âWalt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos.Â â After a little hunting, Emerson found Whitmanâs name and the address of his distributor in a newspaper advertisement. He then wrote his famous letter to Whitman, welcoming him to immortality: âI greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground somewhere for such a start.â"],["p","In response, Whitman published the letter in the bookâs next edition, along with twenty new poems and his own open letter to Emerson of several thousand words celebrating âthat vast basis of the supremacy of Individualityâthat new moral American continentâ whose âshores you foundâ:"],["blockquote",["p","I say you have led The States thereâhave led Me there. I say that none has ever done, or ever can do, a greater deed for The States, than your deed. Others may line out the lines, build cities, work mines, break up farms; it is yours to have been the original true Captain who put to sea, intuitive, positive, rendering the first report, to be told less by any report, and more by the mariners of a thousand bays, in each tack of their arriving and departing, many years after you."]],["p","Whitman was a fact of American life from that moment forward. It took a little longer for an equally important disciple to surface: Emily Dickinson, who treasured an edition of Emersonâs poems given to her by an admirer, and whose brother and sister-in-law, Austin and Susan Dickinson, had hosted Emerson many times at their handsome house, the Evergreens, just across the field from her home. Of course, Dickinsonâs poems sound nothing like Emersonâs. He provided, for the wild synaptic activity of his protÃ©gÃ©s, the framework. He was their server. If Emersonâs poems had been just a little better than they were, we might not have American literature as we know it. Our greatest writers, seeing their own visions usurped, might have been content to remain his readers.Â â¦"]]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/ecstasy-of-influence","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7622d4972cd5b83286","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"books"},{"id":"5c2e1c962396212cbb9fc9be","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Children","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"children"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c2710c62d10815437","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Death","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"death"},{"id":"5c2e1cc24a08312cd3aa6c9e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Grief","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"grief"},{"id":"5c2e1e177e716b454591af50","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"âHenry David Thoreauâ","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"henry-david-thoreau"},{"id":"5c2e308b397f5b30646d0a54","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Louisa May Alcott","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"louisa-may-alcott"},{"id":"5c2e1df1b75f002c8941e602","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Poetry Collections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"poetry-collections"},{"id":"5c2e1e302396212cbb9fcb4d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ralph-waldo-emerson"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"592e2a5036e1a35e5cba5262","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Books","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"books"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Books","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"books"}]}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Books","url":"/tag/books"},{"name":"Children","url":"/tag/children"},{"name":"Death","url":"/tag/death"},{"name":"Grief","url":"/tag/grief"},{"name":"âHenry David Thoreauâ","url":"/tag/henry-david-thoreau"},{"name":"Louisa May Alcott","url":"/tag/louisa-may-alcott"},{"name":"Poetry Collections","url":"/tag/poetry-collections"},{"name":"Ralph Waldo Emerson","url":"/tag/ralph-waldo-emerson"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Dan Chiasson","type":"author","title":"Dan Chiasson, a contributor to The New Yorker since 2007, teaches English at Wellesley College.

Markowitz is sixteen and in the eleventh grade at Eleanor Roosevelt High, on East Seventy-sixth Street. âMy dad is a lawyer, and my mom is a banker at JP Morgan,â she said one morning, while strolling up Madison Avenue. âThey, like, donât know who I am or where I came from.â Markowitz has long brown hair and wore bright-pink lipstick and big Kate Spade sunglasses. She has taken a fashion-design class at Parsons and describes her style as âelegant punk.â She used to do Model U.N., and sheâd like to get back into it. In the meantime, sheâs serving as the youngest member ever on Community Board 8."],["p","âI applied when I was fifteen, which youâre not really supposed to do,â Markowitz said. âMy principal sent an e-mail basically explaining that teen-agers could now apply because of new legislation. There was this meeting at City Hall.â She had never been, but it sounded cool. âIt was kind of hard to get around down thereâI donât know how the streets are organized.â New York City community boards, of which there are fifty-nine, serve as advisory bodies to the City Council, the Mayorâs Office, and other agencies; each board comprises fifty members, who are appointed by their borough president. Markowitz, who is used to applying for thingsâlike junior high (East Side Middle) and internships (with Senator Charles Schumer)âfaced a multi-round screening process. After submitting a formal application, she had a group interview, in which she was asked to participate in a team challenge: âWe had to pretend we were in the wilderness and we had items that we had to list in terms of importance.â Then she had a one-on-one with her City Council representative, Ben Kallos. âWe did have a frank conversation about schoolwork and how hard this would be,â Kallos said later. âShe could not bring her homework to meetings.â Markowitz got the job. âMy mom was like, âThey really let you vote?â And I was like, âYeah!âÂ â"],["p","Crossing Seventy-third, Markowitz explained that her issues are education and affordable housing. Although Times Square is outside her boardâs jurisdiction, she has followed the controversy over the body-painted topless women who pose for photos with tourists there. âI like the whole free-the-nipple movement,â she said. âIâm a feminist, and thereâs the idea that a nipple is on both genders. I personally wouldnât walk around topless in Times Square, though.â"],["p","Sheâs still getting used to being on the board. âThe monthly meetings are from six-thirty to nine, so when you have school it is long,â she said. âAt the first meeting, I was so confused. They say âmotion to vote onâ and then they give, like, a number. I had no idea what they were voting on.â"],["p","Her districtâwhich extends from Fifty-ninth Street up to Ninety-sixth Street on the East Side, plus Roosevelt Islandâhas a lot of historic buildings. âIf people want to make a change to any of those buildings, they have to go past the board,â she said. Members also weigh in on matters before the State Legislature, like whether to legalize marijuana. âI think it should be legalized,â Markowitz said. âItâs crazyâI know a boy who went to jail for a few days because of weed.â A regular item on the agenda is liquor licenses. âSometimes people say, âThis bar serves underage kids!â And Iâm likeââ Markowitz smiled and shrugged. She is too young to buy a drink, but, she said, âI do get to decide who gets a liquor license.â"],["p","Her classmates for the most part are not into politics. âEveryone is obsessed with clothes,â she said. âAnd Kanye West.â Several other teen-agers have joined community boards; they compare notes in a Facebook group. She has befriended a septuagenarian CB8 member named Dave."],["p","Markowitzâs dream job is Secretary of State. âBut a lot of people are mad at John Kerry right now about the Iran nuclear deal, so, I mean, I donât know if I want to be hated so much,â she said. She likes Bill de Blasio well enough. âA lot of kids are like, âOh, no snow day!âÂ â She rolled her eyes."],["p","This summer, during her internship in Chuck Schumerâs Manhattan office, Markowitz did casework, mostly, which meant answering the phone and logging âconcerns.â She was in the room recently when the Senator gave a press conference with Amy Schumer, who is his cousin, on expanding gun control.

American artâand what makes it weird, too. The museumâs curator of performance, Jay Sanders, recently showcased ",["em",{"class":"small"},"dancenoise"],", the potent performance duo whoâve done so much to break down those old theatre walls and make politics the locus of a frenzied, amusing, and thought-provoking style. One playwright who would fit well in Sandersâs kind of programming is Lucas Hnath. He is an artist whose particular brand of American strangeness grows along with his strengths, many of whichâa sense of high drama, and a deep understanding of how the patriarchy wants to hold on to just thatâare not immediately apparent in his minimal scripts, which look, on the page, less like dialogue than like poems."],["p","The thirty-six-year-old writer grew up strange. Raised in Orlando, he says that an early expectation was that he would become a preacher, in part because of his motherâs interests. She herself enrolled in seminary when he was a teen-ager, and he sat in on her classes, picked up some Greek and Hebrew, and learned how to interpret the Bible. Translating is the playwrightâs job; he must transcribe and shape what one characterâs soul says to another. Hnath skipped life as a pastor, he says, because he didnât want to be responsible for peopleâs souls; he chose another way into magic and mysticism by becoming a playwright."],["p","Soon after developing his voice at New York Universityâhe got his M.F.A. in dramatic writingâHnath started having his work produced; the first piece I saw was âA Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney,â in 2013, at SoHo Rep. It was about Disney, death, and legacy. As directed by Sarah Benson, the theatreâs visionary director, there was something nasty about the showânot an assault on dead white men but a sneaky attack on heritage. It was hard to look at, and hard to look away. Hnathâs eleventh full-length play, âThe Christians,â at Playwrights Horizons (in previews, opening Sept. 17), is set in a megachurch. Itâs also about men battling for power, but instead of money and show business the issues are influence and faith: How do we interpret, let alone control, another personâs vision? And why do men fight over the right to say what they mean while grabbing everyone elseâs right to speak, too? For all its control on the page, âThe Christiansâ is about the uncontrollable, which is to say, how we imagine what life will look like once we enter the everlasting.Â â¦"]],"canonicalUrl":"http://web.archive.org/web/20191222153447/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/09/07/divine-intervention","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c842bc86f2c9a2449b4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"slug":"culture"},{"id":"5c2e1c7636cecf40192141bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Theatre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"theatre"}],"sections":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":[{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"magazine","children":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5910aa3ddd6207318b5db99c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Theatre","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-theatre"},{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"The Theatre","parent":[{"id":"59040e521048cc5ce9e6a56c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Magazine","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"magazine"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"the-theatre"}]}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contentTags":[{"name":"Culture","url":"/tag/culture"},{"name":"Theatre","url":"/tag/theatre"}],"contentType":"article","contributors":[{"name":"Hilton Als","type":"author","title":"Hilton Als, a staff writer at The New Yorker, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.

E. Watson, the populist from Georgia who had a long and increasingly demagogic career in American politics, wrote in 1910:"],["blockquote",["p","The scum of creation has been dumped on us. Some of our principal cities are more foreign than American. The most dangerous and corrupting hordes of the Old World have invaded us. The vice and crime which they have planted in our midst are sickening and terrifying. What brought these Goths and Vandals to our shores? The manufacturers are mainly to blame. They wanted cheap labor: and they didnât care a curse how much harm to our future might be the consequence of their heartless policy."]],["p","The objects of Watsonâs bile were the Italians, Poles, Jews, and other European immigrants then pouring into the United States. A century later, in the populist summer of 2015, some of their great-grandchildren have been cheering Donald Trump as he denounces the latest generation of immigrants, in remarkably similar terms."],["p","American populism has a complicated history, and Watson embodied its paradoxes. He ended his career, as a U.S. senator, whipping up white-Protestant enmity against blacks, Catholics, and Jews; but at the outset, as a leader of the Peopleâs Party in the eighteen-nineties, he urged poor whites and blacks to join together and upend an economic order dominated by âthe money power.â Watson wound up as Trump, but he started out closer to Bernie Sanders, and his hostility to the one per cent of the Gilded Age would do Sanders proud. Some of Watsonâs early ideasârural free delivery of mail, for exampleâeventually came to fruition."],["p","Thatâs the volatile nature of populism: it can ignite reform or reaction, idealism or scapegoating. It flourishes in periods like Watsonâs, and like our own, when large numbers of citizens who see themselves as the backbone of America (âproducersâ then, âthe middle classâ now) feel that the game is rigged against them. They arenât the wretched of the earthâSanders attracts educated urbanites, Trump small-town businessmen. Theyâre people with a sense of violated ownership, holding a vision of an earlier, better America that has come under threat."],["p","Populism is a stance and a rhetoric more than an ideology or a set of positions. It speaks of a battle of good against evil, demanding simple answers to difficult problems. (Trump: âTrade? Weâre gonna fix it. Health care? Weâre gonna fix it.â) Itâs suspicious of the normal bargaining and compromise that constitute democratic governance. (On the stump, Sanders seldom touts his bipartisan successes as chairman of the Senate Veteransâ Affairs Committee.) Populism can have a conspiratorial and apocalyptic bentâthe belief that the country, or at least its decent majority, is facing imminent ruin at the hands of a particular group of malefactors (Mexicans, billionaires, Jews, politicians)."],["p","Above all, populism seeks and thrills to the authentic voice of the people. Followers of both Sanders and Trump prize their manâs willingness to articulate what ordinary people feel but politicians fear to say. âI might not agree with Bernie on everything, but I believe he has values, and heâs going to stick to those and he will not lie to us,â a supporter named Liam Dewey told ABC News. The fact that Sanders has a tendency to drone on like a speaker at the Socialist Scholars Conference circa 1986âone who happens to have an audience of twenty-seven thousandâonly enhances his bona fides. Heâs the improbable beneficiary of a deeply disenchanted public. As for Trump, his rhetoric is so crude and from-the-hip that his fans are continually reassured about its authenticity."],["p","Responding to the same political moment, the phenomena of Trump and Sanders bear a superficial resemblance. Both men have no history of party loyalty, which only enhances their street credâtheir authority comes from a direct bond with their supporters, free of institutional interference. They both rail against foreign-trade deals, decry the unofficial jobless rate, and express disdain for the political class and the dirty money it raises to stay in office. Last week, Trump even denounced the carried-interest tax loophole for investment managers (a favorite target of the left). âThese hedge-fund guys are getting away with murder,â he told CBS News. âThese are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.â"],["p","But the difference between Sanders and Trump is large, and more fundamental than the difference between their personal styles or their places on the political spectrum. Sanders, who has spent most of his career as an outsider on the inside, believes ardently in politics. He views the political arena as a battle of opposing classes (even more than Elizabeth Warren, he really does seem to hate the rich), but believes that their conflicts can be managed through elections and legislation. What Sanders calls a political revolution is closer to a campaign of far-reaching but plausible reforms. He proposes a financial-transactions tax and the breakup of the biggest banks; he doesnât demand the nationalization of banking. His views might appall Wall Street, but they exist within the realm of rational persuasion."],["p","Trump (whatever he really believes) is playing the game of anti-politics. From George Wallace to Ross Perot, anti-politics has been a constant in recent American history; candidates as diverse as Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama have won the Presidency by seeming to reject or rise above the unlovely business of politics and government. Trump takes it to a demagogic extreme. Thereâs no dirtier word in the lexicon of his stump speech than âpolitician.â He incites his audiencesâ contempt for the very notion of solving problems through political means. China, the Islamic State, immigrants, unemployment, Wall Street: just let him handle itâheâll build the wall, deport the eleven million, rewrite the Fourteenth Amendment, create the jobs, kill the terrorists. He offers no idea beyond himself, the leader who can reverse the countryâs decline by sheer force of personality. Speaking in Mobile, Alabama, recently, he paused to wonder whether representative government was even necessary. After ticking off his leads in various polls, Trump asked the crowd of thirty thousand, âWhy do we need an election? We donât need an election.â When Trump narrows his eyes and juts out his lip, heâs a showman pretending to be a strongman."],["p","There arenât many examples of the populist strongman in American history (Huey Long comes to mind). Our attachment to democracy, if not to its institutions and professionals, has been too firm for that. There are more examples of populists who, while failing to win national election, extend the parameters of discourse and ultimately bring about important reforms (think of Robert M. La Follette, Sr.).

Thomas Hardy novel, they at least seem to promise plenty of carbs. And so it is at Faro, a new Italian restaurant in Bushwick, where the kitchen makes its flour from grains grown upstate and then turns it into inventive pasta shapes. Thereâs also a wood-burning oven that does wonders with asparagus and octopus, animal-welfare-approved meat, and a minimalist dining room so cool and spacious that it looks like an imagined Los Angeles."],["p","You canât eat the Zeitgeist, though, and the trendy premise of Faro gives way to an oddly old-fashioned meal. This is a polite way of saying that the food is very heavy. The Roman gnocchi, especially when served at the height of summer, will send even the heartiest of eaters into a fugue state as she plows through two huge planks of semolina. They seem the size of Cabbage Patch Kids, and rather than swim in their pool of thick white sauce they sit very still, mollified by a blanket of kale, egg, and Parmesan. Still, polishing off a chewy starch surrounded by cream isnât exactly hard work. After mining the local-grain porridge for chanterelles, it disappears as well, along with the squid-ink calamaretti, crowned with a wreath of lobster and doused in a cilantro-coconut curry. Lemonâs for wimps, as Caligula probably said."],["p","That calamaretti, like much of whatâs on offer, looks spectacular: black, red, and green, on a handmade plate from a local studio that designs quirky ceramics for Manhattan tasting menus. You half expect hashtags to form in the steam above it (#NoFilter, #EatLocal). Faro should, by rights, be annoying, precious, and easily dismissed, but there are so many pleasing details, like pickled mustard seeds in the beef tartare, and chÃ¨vre cream beneath the fire-roasted beetsânot to mention all those idiosyncratic plates scraped clean. Dessertâs a moist, dense cake, like polenta, made with corn ground in house. Whiskey sours are neither local nor new, but theyâre good, too.Â â¦"],["p",["em","Open daily for dinner.
