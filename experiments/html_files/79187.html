<p><b>Q: What's been the toughest thing about the transition, what's been the easiest, the most fun, the most interesting to you?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> I suppose the most interesting thing has been meeting the various people who are in the department head positions. We have some very qualified people doing things that I don’t think is always fully appreciated by the people or even those of us in government understand the magnitude of what some of these agencies are doing. That's been very gratifying.</p>
<p>We've extended the opportunity to continue to many of those [department heads] because we believe they are doing a very good job. The most difficult thing about this I suppose in the transition is trying to come to grips with a very difficult budget. In fact I'm leaving here in just a few minutes to return to some budget briefings this afternoon. Working with that with [the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget], they do a good job of laying the issues out, giving projections of what revenue projections are expected to be, spending for the current year and the curves they see coming. This is going to be a difficult supplemental budget and an even more difficult 2012 general budget.</p>
<p><b>Q: On the budget, what have you learned, what's that curve like? Is it as bad as you feared?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It's not as bad as I was led to believe it might have been. But it's bad enough. It's going to be difficult because for lack of a better term, all the low-hanging fruit already has been picked either last year or the year before. The choices that confront us now are going to be very difficult choices.</p>
<p>There are many facets to the budget itself. Yesterday, for example, we were looking at what the HOPE scholarship situation was. That's not a very good picture looming out there. The Legislature, of course, already put statutory changes in place to deal with the so-called first trigger that will cut in half the book allowance this summer. It's somewhat obvious we will then immediately move into the second trigger that will be eliminating the book allowance all together. Even all those will not be able to put us on a stable footing. There will have to be some choices. And some of these will have to be statutory changes to salvage the program.</p>
<p>We're looking at the full magnitude of the deficit. Even though revenue has not dropped, it has been on a gradual increase, whereas the drawdown has been a very dramatic increase.</p>
<p>That's probably attributable to several factors. One is the economy itself. People who were working and lost their job are now going back to school.</p>
<p>Or whether it just be continuing in college or deciding to go to college whereas that might not have been a choice in the past.</p>
<p>The increased volume of students, the participation of regents and technical college system [schools], those have had rather dramatic effects on the projects for solvency of the HOPE scholarship program. There are some choices that are going to have to be made. The timetable for those choices is not going to be long.</p>
<p><b>Q: What choices? Cut back eligibility, increase the threshold to qualify?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> There are a lot of proposals. Some being to increase eligibility requirements, some to not expend money for remedial programs, where students are having to take remedial classes. The one I least favor, of course, is getting away from merit-based. I think we need to keep it merit-based, and I think we'll be able to do that.</p>
<p>We may have to go back to a very fundamental approach, and that is look at HOPE as it was originally conceived and passed and look at all the enhancements added to it over the years and decide which of those enhancements can we continue with, which need to be eliminated.</p>
<p><b>Q: Talking about higher ed, there was a huge fight over the budget for higher ed. It's a problem that isn't going to go away.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Obviously it is in a different situation because of the constitutionality of the lump-sum budgeting for the Board of Regents. It does not give the governor or General Assembly ability to make specific recommendations of where the cuts will come from. Obviously the elimination of the Extension Service was one of those rather flamboyant approaches, and it had its desired effect of inflaming the public. But it was not, and ultimately it was backed off of, because it was not a responsible approach to the problem.</p>
<p>Hopefully some lessons were learned as a result of that last year, and hopefully there will be a more realistic approach to where reductions should come from.</p>
<p><b>Q: Staying on education, K-12 funding? Do you see a path to funding schools that eliminates some of the problems we've had the last few years? And part of that is the transfer of some of the responsibility to local governments through property taxes.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Both funding sources, both state and local, are under severe attack in terms of the pressure that is being felt. The state, of course, as part of the general budgetary process. Local governments, of course, are under huge pressure as a result of ad valorem taxes and as residential property values and the process of making those equitable and reducing those down. Both sources of funding for public education, that is the state and local governments, are under tremendous pressure. The state being primarily a sales tax, income tax system and the local being a primarily property tax augmented with some sales taxes, although those sales taxes aren't dedicated to education.</p>
<p>The reality is there are going to be tough choices again on K-12 education budgets again this year. There's no way around that. I advocated, you may recall during the campaign, we ought to look at freeing up choices for local boards of education to use revenue as they deem more appropriate. Some of that is a statutory formula; some of it is probably regulatory in nature.</p>
<p>We have not gotten into all the details of that yet. That is something I look forward to talking to the state school superintendent and state school board about how do we work cooperatively to try and make sure we use the money as effectively as possible.</p>
<p><b>Q: Back to taxes. A.D. [Frazier, head of a special committee created by the General Assembly to study the state’s tax code] was with you yesterday [at the state Farm Bureau convention], and I covered their meeting the other day. Are there specific things you want to see in [the committee’s] recommendations? Something that makes it easier for you to sign?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> I have to go back to our campaign platform. And keep in mind our primary focus is to create jobs for our state. Any change we make to our tax structure, the first question we ought to ask is does that create private-sector jobs for the state of Georgia? And if it does, then we should look at it favorably, and if it doesn't, then perhaps we should look at some other things that will achieve a better purpose. Whether we like it or not, corporate taxes are a factor in businesses deciding where they're going to locate, whether they're going to expand. I had a conversation with a business that is located in our state. They are contemplating expansion. But they're also looking at some of our neighboring states that do not have the corporate tax we have. Those are very real things. These are jobs that hang in the balance depending on what direction we take. I think there is a debate that is going to be coming. I don't know at what point we will see it manifest itself. That is: Which is better in terms of job creation? Is it better to lower the corporate income tax rate or is it better to lower the individual income tax rate? That debate has yet to manifest itself.</p>
<p><b>Q: At the meeting last week there were some comments that weren't very positive about cutting corporate tax. If it's not in the package, would you either consider not signing it or would you consider advocating for it as a separate piece of legislation?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It's a little premature to try to answer that because I don't know what the whole package is going to look like. Even though corporate taxes are a relatively small part of the overall revenue, it does have an impact in terms of companies making decisions of expanding in our state, locating here initially or whatever. I don't think you can ignore it. If you do not cut corporate taxes, then what are you going to do to make the tax structure more business-friendly?</p>
<p><b>Q: What's been fun? What have you enjoyed about this? Are you exhausted? Tell me something about how Nathan Deal is dealing with all this.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Nothing can be more stressful than a campaign, so everything is relative.</p>
<p><b>Q: Have you measured the drapes at the Governor’s Mansion yet?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No I have not. I've been focused on this transition and dealing with the budget. I let my wife have the responsibility for the inauguration, and we have a good team working there on it. I guess the fun part is feeling as if you have some ability to alter the direction of our state, hopefully in the right way to be able to make a positive impact, not only for the immediate future but for the long term. That's both a humbling feeling as well as an exhilarating feeling.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are the big things you have to do? There are a number of agency heads still to be named. You've got to produce a budget.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> You're going to have the supplemental [budget]. There will be some alterations reflected in the supplemental budget. But unlike years past where the supplemental was always the Christmas tree in January, this is not going to be that kind of January, and it hasn't been for quite a couple of years now. We're going to be looking at the entire budget process and, of course, focusing on the executive branch to begin with because that's where we have the most immediate impact ourselves. That's what our transition team has been doing as they've gone through interviewing existing heads of agencies, I've charged them with several basic concepts. First of all, let's understand what the agency does. Let's decide if it is a function that is worth keeping, and if it is worth keeping, how can we do it better than we're currently doing it.</p>
<p>And secondly, is it a function that is similar to or is able to be consolidated with another state agency so that we can save the expenses of administration simply by the consolidation process? We believe we're going to have success on both fronts that we'll be able to reduce the number of people employed in the executive branch and we'll be able to reduce the costs associated with that.</p>
<p><b>Q: Any of those you can share yet?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Not yet. We haven't been through the whole process yet, but we will as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there anything I haven't' touched on that you want to talk about?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> You're dealing with people. And you're dealing with having the best people you can get in these positions of leadership. The qualities I want are first of all people of integrity. People who have an understanding in depth of the job they're asked to do and people who have a foresight as to how they can make their agency function more appropriately to serve the needs of Georgians. I think that's what happens sometimes in state government and all government quite frankly: We assume that because an agency has been created and charged with a responsibility that that is something to be perpetuated ad infinitum, and we very rarely go back and assess the underlying purpose we had when it was originally created. We don't have the luxury of ignoring asking those questions. I'm going to ask everybody who is the head of an agency to figure out first, how can you do your job better, more efficiently and more cost-effectively and are there things that can be consolidated? And if so, tell us what they are.</p>
<p>We're probably not going to be able to do a lot in depth at this point about looking at privatization of services, but that is certainly part of the picture. We may get into that before the session is concluded. But we've had success in our state with privatization of certain services, and I think there are others that we can continue to explore that.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do you have a plan for Jan. 11, the day after the inauguration. Are you going to roll out a 100-days plan? Is there one piece of legislation you want to push first? Have you mapped that out? It's a question of style.</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> It's going to be an effort on our part to not surprise the leadership in the House and the Senate to give them foreknowledge and hopefully participation in the decision-making process, especially as it relates to major changes in state government. They are going to be the ones who have to work with their members to get legislation passed, and many of these structural changes obviously require legislative action.</p>
<p>I view this as an opportunity for us all to work for a common goal. Now that may not always be possible. There are going to be differences of opinion. I view my role as setting out some markers, the general road map of where I think the state ought to go. I made a statement this morning in a meeting I think there are two big forces always at work in the political arena. One is circumstances. Now, circumstances are things you generally don't have control over. The other is principles. You do have control over your principles. Sometimes your principles and your philosophy of how government should operate don't coincide with circumstances that allow you to implement your philosophy. Now, I think we have the opportunity -- whether it be bad economic times or not -- that we have the circumstances that coincide with my political philosophy, my political philosophy being that government be as small as possible and yet do the essential things it needs to do. That's the philosophy. It coincides with the circumstances of a downturned economy where revenue is restricted. Those both work in cohesion with each other to move to making government more effective, more efficient and basically smaller.</p>
<p>The reality is if you want bigger government, now is not the environment in which you can [have] it. I view it as an opportunity. It's been a thrilling experience for me thus far to be able to take philosophy, mesh it with the economic circumstances of our state and say let's put these two together. Let's come up with some ideas and some movements we'll be proud of.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is left? You have to pick your House floor leaders, decide about a revenue commissioner. What are the big ones?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> We just announced today Mark Williams for commissioner of natural resources. We think that's a great selection. He's been a great representative. There are some other major department heads we have not made final determinations on; Department of Revenue being one of those. We're just working through that, and hopefully we'll conclude fairly soon.</p>
<p><b>Q: Anything else?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> I was just telling [spokesman] Brian [Robinson] I just finished up “American Lion,” Jon Meacham's' book about Andrew Jackson. It's a part of American history I didn't recall. I didn't realize how close our country was to a civil war back in the 1830s. He probably postponed it for about 30 years there. That was the era of nullification. It was the big issue with John C. Calhoun and their nullification concepts. The ironic thing is we're kind of seeing the re-emergence of those ideas of importance of states’ rights, the relationship of states to the federal government, and it's an interesting corollary to where we are today.</p>
<p>Whereas in the late 1820s and mid-1830s it was precipitated by the Tariff Act, which the Southern states felt was punitive to them, and it was regional in the issues that caused the issues to fester. Here we have something like health care reform, and it's not really regional. It's an action by the federal government that states are reacting to. Maybe not by way of nullification, although that's been suggested, but states are reacting to it and it brings back into focus some of these same issues that have been repeated throughout our history. You see more states, and it's not just regional, in their opposition to this major national federal policy. That's one that's a major issue to states. When you start talking about the financial obligations this bill will place on this state and every state, it's huge. That's going to play itself out in the courts first of all, and whether it plays itself out in Congress remains to be seen.</p>
