<h1>Another Ice Age?</h1>
<p>
</p><p>In Africa, drought continues for the sixth consecutive year, adding
terribly to the toll of famine victims. During 1972 record rains in
parts of the U.S., Pakistan and Japan caused some of the worst flooding
in centuries. In Canada's wheat belt, a particularly chilly and rainy
spring has delayed planting and may well bring a disappointingly small
harvest. Rainy Britain, on the other hand, has suffered from
uncharacteristic dry spells the past few springs. A series of unusually
cold winters has gripped the American Far West, while New England and
northern Europe have recently experienced the mildest winters within
anyone's recollection.</p><p>As they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past
several years, a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect
that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are
actually part of a global climatic upheaval. However widely the weather
varies from place to place and time to time, when meteorologists take
an average of temperatures around the globe they find that the
atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three
decades. The trend shows no indication of reversing.
Climatological Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive, for
the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of
another ice age. <aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2033925,00.html" target="_blank">(See photos of how scientists are trying to keep Africa's deserts at bay.)</a></aside></p><p>Telltale signs are everywhere  from the unexpected persistence and
thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward
migration of a warmth-loving creature like the armadillo from the
Midwest.Since the 1940s the mean global temperature has dropped about 2.7° F.
Although that figure is at best an estimate, it is supported by other
convincing data. When Climatologist George J. Kukla of Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory and his wife Helena
analyzed satellite weather data for the Northern Hemisphere, they found
that the area of the ice and snow cover had suddenly increased by 12%
in 1971 and the increase has persisted ever since. Areas of Baffin
Island in the Canadian Arctic, for example, were once totally free of
any snow in summer; now they are covered year round. <aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,684430104001_2033121,00.html" target="_blank">(See a video on the history of climate change.)</a></aside></p><p>Scientists have found other indications of global cooling. For one thing
there has been a noticeable expansion of the great belt of dry,
high-altitude polar winds  the so-called circumpolar vortex—that
sweep from west to east around the top and bottom of the world.
Indeed it is the widening of this cap of cold air that is the immediate
cause of Africa's drought. By blocking moisture-bearing equatorial
winds and preventing them from bringing rainfall to the parched
sub-Sahara region, as well as other drought-ridden areas stretching all
the way from Central America to the Middle East and India, the polar
winds have in effect caused the Sahara and other deserts to reach
farther to the south. Paradoxically, the same vortex has created quite different weather
quirks in the U.S. and other temperate zones. As the winds swirl around
the globe, their southerly portions undulate like the bottom of a
skirt. Cold air is pulled down across the Western U.S. and warm air is
swept up to the Northeast. The collision of air masses of widely
differing temperatures and humidity can create violent storms—the
Midwest's recent rash of disastrous tornadoes, for example.</p><p> <aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/picturesoftheweek" target="_blank">See TIME's Pictures of the Week.</a></aside> </p><!--pagebreak-->
<p><b>Sunspot Cycle.</b></p><p> The changing weather is apparently connected with
differences in the amount of energy that the earth's surface receives
from the sun. Changes in the earth's tilt and distance from the sun could, for
instance, significantly increase or decrease the amount of solar
radiation falling on either hemisphere—thereby altering the earth's
climate. Some observers have tried to connect the eleven-year sunspot
cycle with climate patterns, but have so far been unable to provide a
satisfactory explanation of how the cycle might be involved.</p><p>Man, too, may be somewhat responsible for the cooling trend. The
University of Wisconsin's Reid A. Bryson and other climatologists
suggest that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a
result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more
sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth.</p> <aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/interactive/0,31813,1620995,00.html" target="_blank">(See an infographic on the effects of the changing climate.)</a></aside><p>Climatic Balance. Some scientists like Donald Oilman, chief of the
National Weather Service's long-range-prediction group, think that the
cooling trend may be only temporary. But all agree that vastly more
information is needed about the major influences on the earth's
climate. Indeed, it is to gain such knowledge that 38 ships and 13
aircraft, carrying scientists from almost 70 nations, are now
assembling in the Atlantic and elsewhere for a massive 100-day study of
the effects of the tropical seas and atmosphere on worldwide weather.
The study itself is only part of an international scientific effort
known acronymically as GARP (for Global Atmospheric Research Program).</p><p>Whatever the cause of the cooling trend, its effects could be extremely
serious, if not catastrophic. Scientists figure that only a 1% decrease
in the amount of sunlight hitting the earth's surface could tip the
climatic balance, and cool the planet enough to send it sliding down
the road to another ice age within only a few hundred years.</p><aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1670875,00.html" target="_blank">(See TIME's video, "This Changing Earth.")</a></aside><p>The earth's current climate is something of an anomaly; in the past
700,000 years, there have been at least seven major episodes of
glaciers spreading over much of the planet. Temperatures have been as
high as they are now only about 5% of the time. But there is a peril
more immediate than the prospect of another ice age. Even if
temperature and rainfall patterns change only slightly in the near
future in one or more of the three major grain-exporting countries  the
U.S., Canada and Australia  global food stores would be sharply
reduced. University of Toronto Climatologist Kenneth Hare, a former
president of the Royal Meteorological Society, believes that the
continuing drought and the recent failure of the Russian harvest gave
the world a grim premonition of what might happen. Warns Hare:
"I don't believe that the world's present population is sustainable
if there are more than three years like 1972 in a row."</p><p> <aside class="jump"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190925181622/http://www.time.com/time/cartoonsoftheweek" target="_blank">See the Cartoons of the Week.</a></aside> </p>
