<p>by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616212114/mailto:jmiller@pubaff.ucsf.edu">Jeff Miller</a> </p>
<p>In <br/>
  our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616212114/http://pub.ucsf.edu/today/cache/news/200601203.html">last story</a> <br/>
  about Medicare Part D, Marilyn Stebbins, clinical professor in the UCSF School <br/>
  of Pharmacy, offered an independent, frontline perspective on how the new drug <br/>
  insurance plan was then unfolding. With less than 30 days before the May 15, <br/>
  2006 sign up deadline, Stebbins, who has been busy conducting education and <br/>
  enrollment sessions with seniors all over northern California, and her colleague <br/>
  Tim Cutler, assistant clinical professor in the UCSF School of Pharmacy, answer <br/>
  this latest round of Medicare Part D questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have most eligible seniors now signed up with a drug insurance plan? <br/>
  And among those who haven’t, are there any population groups that seem more <br/>
  reluctant or unable to do so? Why?</strong> </p>
<p>Of the 43 million Medicare-eligible patients, the US Department of Health <br/>
      and Human Services estimates that 39.1 million will have creditable drug <br/>
      coverage in 2006. It is estimated that 29.3 million of these enrollees would <br/>
      be enrolled in a Part D plan, and that 10 million of these enrollees would <br/>
      have creditable coverage through an employer or union. As of March 1, 2006, <br/>
      17.9 million of the 29.3 million have enrolled in a Part D plan. The majority <br/>
      of those that have enrolled have had facilitated enrollment. Only 6.4 million <br/>
      beneficiaries have actually signed up for a Part D plan on their own. This <br/>
      leaves another 11.9 million who have not enrolled, but are eligible. </p>
<p>For the March 2006 Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Enrollment Update, <br/>
      go <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616212114/http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7453.pdf">here</a> (pdf).</p>
<p>Of these 11.9 million beneficiaries who have not yet enrolled, cultural <br/>
      barriers, where there is a lack of trust in government, and language barriers <br/>
      may play a role. The majority of outreach programs and materials produced <br/>
      have been in English. There are also those who are just too confused by <br/>
      the enrollment process (Internet or 800 telephone numbers) and the large <br/>
      numbers of plan choices and options. </p>
<p><br/>
<strong>What is the best way to reach the unregistered before the May 15 <br/>
      deadline? Is the UCSF School of Pharmacy making any special effort to do <br/>
      so?</strong></p>
<p>Pharmacies are making a huge effort to reach Medicare beneficiaries before <br/>
      May 15 with mailings and incentives to come in and talk to the pharmacist <br/>
      about a Part D plan. The UCSF School of Pharmacy, in particular, has been <br/>
      conducting Medicare outreach programs to assist patients in the decision <br/>
      and enrollment process. Many of the areas that have been targeted include <br/>
      underserved, low-income communities. An upcoming outreach program will be <br/>
      offered in five languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Russian, Spanish <br/>
      and English - with one-on-one sessions to assist these individuals <br/>
      with their plan choices and to ensure that they are getting any extra help <br/>
      for which they may be eligible.</p>
<p><strong>What are the penalties if someone misses the May 15 deadline, and <br/>
      how are the penalties calculated? </strong></p>
<p>If you are told that you are eligible for Medicare Part D and you do not <br/>
      join by May 15, you will be assessed a penalty AND you may not join a plan <br/>
      until the annual open enrollment period the next year (November 15-December <br/>
      31). If you join at a later date than when you were eligible, you will be <br/>
      assessed a penalty of 1% per month of missed enrollment. The penalty is <br/>
      based upon the national average premium in the year the patient signs up. <br/>
    </p>
<p>Here is an example:  <br/>
      You decide 4 years after you become eligible for Medicare to join a Part <br/>
      D plan. That year, the national average premium is $50.<br/>
  </p>
<ul class="support">
  <li> 
     
      <font color="#FF9933"> • </font> 4 years of missed enrollment adds up to 48 months x 1% = 48%.
    
  </li>

  <li> 
     
       <font color="#FF9933"> • </font> 48% of $50 (the national average premium that year) = $24. 
    
  </li>
  <li> 
     
       <font color="#FF9933"> • </font> $24 is added to the premium that the patient chooses that year. 
    
  </li>
  <li> 
     
      <font color="#FF9933"> • </font>If the plan the patient chooses has a $15 premium, the patient will 
        pay $39 each month that year, instead of $15, due to the penalty. 
    
  </li>

  <li>
    
<font color="#FF9933"> • </font> This penalty is recalculated every year, based on that year’s 
        national average premium, and added to the premium of the plan that the 
        patient chooses that year.
          
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is it true that the drug insurance plans can change their coverage <br/>
      almost daily? If true, are the plans required to inform their members in <br/>
      some way? And if prescription drug coverage changes and a drug suddenly <br/>
      is not covered, can members appeal the decision or seek after-the-fact reimbursement?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, drug plans can change their formularies at any time during the year. <br/>
      However, the provision is that the plan must inform the patient, the prescriber <br/>
      and the pharmacy 60 days prior to the change. Each plan must also have an <br/>
      appeal process in place, and a member may appeal to get the drug covered <br/>
      after the change. Usually, the plan will contact the prescriber to determine <br/>
      whether another agent in the formulary would be appropriate. If not, the <br/>
      prescriber can fill out a prior authorization to continue to have the drug <br/>
      covered for the patient. Because of the 60-day prior notification, after-the-fact <br/>
      reimbursement may not be possible. If patients know that a drug they are <br/>
      taking is being removed from the formulary, they need to contact the plan <br/>
      immediately to discuss the appeal process.</p>
<p><strong>Can people who have already signed up with a plan change their <br/>
      mind? What should govern that decision? </strong></p>
<p>This year - and this year only - people who have chosen a plan have one <br/>
      chance to change their mind before May 15, and switch into another plan. <br/>
      If you are in a plan and discover that there may be plan that covers your <br/>
      medications and is less expensive, this may be a good reason to consider <br/>
      changing plans. If you are not sure whether you are in the most economical <br/>
      plan, you may call 1-800-Medicare or go to the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100616212114/http://www.medicare.gov/">website</a> <br/>
      to see whether the plan you are in is the best plan for you, based on the <br/>
      medication that you take. You can also visit your local pharmacy and ask <br/>
      them to help you with the Medicare website, if you are unfamiliar with the <br/>
      Internet. After this year, once you enroll in a plan, that will be your <br/>
      plan for the entire year, and you will not have the option to switch until <br/>
      the next year.</p>
<p><strong>Does the drug insurance coverage extend to other states, so that <br/>
      you don’t have to worry while traveling?</strong></p>
<p>In general, the answer is no. Each Medicare region in the country has its <br/>
      own set of plans that are offered. If you travel outside of your region <br/>
      and the region that you visit does not have that plan, you may be unable <br/>
      to get your prescription filled. There are several plans, however, that <br/>
      are nationwide. To be safe, people should travel with enough medication <br/>
      to cover them while traveling. All plans offer 90-day prescription fills, <br/>
      either at local pharmacies or through mail order, so there should not be <br/>
      a problem getting enough medication to cover you while traveling. If you <br/>
      live a portion of the year outside of your home region, you may want to <br/>
      choose a national plan or be sure that the plan that you have can mail your <br/>
      medication refills to you when you are away.</p>
<p><strong>Do you expect a shakeout of the many different insurance plans <br/>
      after the May 15 enrollee numbers are known? What will happen to those who <br/>
      joined a plan that decides not to participate next year in Medicare Part <br/>
      D?</strong></p>
<p>I think we will see some changes in plans in <br/>
      the next open enrollment period. I think we will see fewer plans and changes <br/>
      in premiums, copayment structures and formularies. Each year, Medicare patients <br/>
      will have to reevaluate their plan choice, even if the plan remains a Medicare <br/>
      Part D plan. This is because the plan can change its structure each year, <br/>
      as well as its formulary, so it may no longer be the best choice for you. <br/>
      If the plan you are in this year chooses not to participate next year, you <br/>
      will receive notification of this, and you will need to choose a new plan <br/>
      during open enrollment.
