<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    THE consumer who pays attention to freshness should find shopping for milk and milk-related products relatively simple. The highly perishable products displayed in the dairy case are usually marked to indicate the last date on which the product can be sold. In certain areas some dairy products are dated according to local restrictions; otherwise the date is determined by the manufacturer.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    In New York City fluid milk and cream are dated according to a regulation established by the municipal Department of Health, and it is illegal to sell them beyond that date. When the dating is up to the manufacturer, the product may still be sold legally after the date passes, but in practice most processors will recall such products or accept them for return.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The expiration date does not mean that the product is unfit for consumption beyond it. Anywhere from a few days' to a couple of weeks' leeway is allowed so that with proper storage the consumer can assume the product will remain wholesome for a time in the home. How long not only is determined by storage conditions and usage but also varies widely from product to product and brand to brand.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    A fresh dairy product will not have any hint of a rank, sour odor.  Even so-called sour cream smells fresh, and any sign of discoloration or mold is an indication of spoilage.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Dairy products bearing the latest date should be purchased. The dairy case should be the final stop on a shopping trip, and products should be refrigerated as soon as possible. Remove them from the refrigerator only briefly. Do not mix products with different dates; the practice shortens the life of the fresher one. Fluid Milk        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    New York City is the only place in the state and one of relatively few in the country that has its own dating system for fluid milk, which may legally be sold only up to 96 hours after 6 A.M. on the day after pasteurization. The rule is the same for whole, skim or low-fat fortified milk.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    According to Charles Reisberg, Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Health, the four-day period should allow the consumer three additional days during which the milk will remain in good condition. ''We know that at seven days after pasteurization there is a lessening in quality, even with milk properly refrigerated at 45 degrees,'' he said.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Outside the city limits the processer determines the expiration date. Dairylea, one of the biggest processers in the region, with headquarters in Rockland County, usually allows 10 to 12 days.  Sealtest milk may be dated from 8 to 12 days from the time of processing, depending on the results of periodic samplings from various plants.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Asked why the city's regulation, which until 1978 limited milk to 66 hours on sale after pasteurization, is stricter, Mr. Reisberg said, ''There are too many variables, and we have no guarantee that proper care has been taken.'' He emphasized that temperature was as important a factor as time. He was alluding primarily to periods when the milk may not be properly refrigerated, when, say, a store is tranferring it from a delivery truck to the display cases and may leave it on the sidewalk or in the aisles. Also, consumers may have groceries delivered, and orders can sit waiting in the store or on a truck for several hours.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Optimally, milk should be kept at 45 degrees or below from the time it leaves the processing plant until it is put into the dairy case.  American Dairy Association literature suggests that milk be stored at 40 degrees at home. The open display cases that most markets use keep the cold air concentrated in the lower portions. ''If a store stacked up the milk in one of those cases I wouldn't buy it from the top,'' said Alfred Place, Director of the Division of Milk Control of the State Department of Agriculture and Markets.        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Milk should never stand at room temperature. If some is kept out for a meal, it should not be mixed back in the original container but covered and stored separately. Milk should not stand in direct light since this can destroy riboflavin (vitamin B2). Though freezing will not affect the nutrients, it is not recommended because some protein will coagulate and flake; while these small particles do not mean that the milk is spoiled, it may not be as satisfactory to use. Cream        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The New York City code requires that regular pasteurized cream or half and half be sold within 96 hours of production, as is milk. If unopened, cream should last about 10 days more. Opening the container will shorten shelf life. For whipping, cream that is a few days old will produce better results because it will naturally thicken as it stands in the refrigerator. Ultrapasteurized cream is given 15 days in New York City, although processors put its shelf life at about 90 days. Butter        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Producers generally mark butter with a two-to-three-month shelf life, although the American Dairy Association does not recommend keeping it for longer than four weeks. Salted butter is somewhat less perishable under refrigeration than unsalted, but in the freezer it may pick up a rancid flavor sooner. Unsalted butter may be frozen for up to nine months. Butter should always be kept covered to preserve its flavor. Buttermilk        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Buttermilk sold commercially is a cultured low-fat product, not the byproduct of butter making. Friendship Dairies in upstate New York stamps its buttermilk with a 26-day code. ''We feel there is a comfortable seven days beyond that pull date,'' the dairy said.  Cultured dairy products such as buttermilk do have a tendency to separate, but stirring should restore the proper texture. Sour Cream        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    Sour cream is made by inoculating carefully controlled cultures into cream with 18 to 20 percent butterfat. The expiration dates on pure sour cream vary: Dairylea marks its product with a 30-day shelf life; Friendship allows 42 days and Sealtest 60 days, each giving a two-week margin of freshness beyond the expiration date. The American Dairy Association says the total keeping time for sour cream is about four weeks. Cottage Cheese        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The life of cottage cheese kept covered and under refrigeration can range from 21 days to 60 days. Fruit-and vegetable-flavored cottage cheese has a somewhat shorter shelf life. The addition of salt extends the keeping quality so salt-free cottage cheese may not keep quite as long. Yogurt        </p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
                    The ingredients in yogurt and its method of production greatly affect shelf life. Natural yogurt and yogurt that is pasteurized before the cultures are added usually remain fresh for a shorter period than yogurts that have been stabilized with gelatin or other additives or pasteurized after fementation. In evaluating freshness, differences between brands must be taken into consideration. Yogurts on the market bear an expiration date from 21 to 50 days after production, with at least another week or two of freshness beyond that.        </p>

<div class="shareTools shareToolsThemeClassic shareToolsThemeClassicHorizontal articleShareToolsBottom" data-description="  THE consumer who pays attention to freshness should find shopping for milk and milk-related products relatively simple. The highly perishable products displayed in the dairy case are usually marked to indicate the last date on which the product can be sold. In certain areas some dairy products are dated according to local restrictions; otherwise the date is determined by the manufacturer.   In New York City fluid milk and cream are dated according to a regulation established by the municipal Department of Health, and it is illegal to sell them beyond that date. When the dating is up to the manufacturer, the product may still be sold legally after the date passes, but in practice most processors will recall such products or accept them for return." data-shares="facebook,twitter,google,email,showall|Share" data-title="FRESHNESS OF MILK PRODUCTS" data-url="http://web.archive.org/web/20180304042559oe_/http://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/10/garden/freshness-of-milk-products.html"></div>
