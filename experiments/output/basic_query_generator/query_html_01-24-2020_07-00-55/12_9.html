AMANPOUR: This week -- jobs. Employment numbers just out look
better than they have in two years. But how real is the recovery?
How can America keep putting people back to work? We'll have a
spirited debate. And I'll be joined by Diane Sawyer. And we ask, how
important is it to buy things that are made in America?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
In Libya, an uprising erupts into civil war. Colonel Gadhafi
told me his people love him.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MOAMMAR GADHAFI: All my people with me. They love me, all.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: But his forces are now battling a rebel army in the
streets. We'll have the latest. And my exclusive interview with
Senator John McCain. He's calling for American military intervention.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And we meet the women warriors behind the uprising. Could they
be al Qaeda's worst nightmare? "This Week," America and the world
starts right now.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Welcome to our viewers here and around the world. These days,
Americans have had to think hard about where the United States stands
in the world, how the American worker fits into a new and changing
global economy, and what stance the United States should take as
people fight for basic freedoms around the Middle East.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We turn first to jobs, issue No. 1 for the American people. And
this week, finally, some good news to report. For the first time in
almost two years, the unemployment rate has dropped below 9 percent.
192,000 jobs were created in February. It's progress, but for many
Americans, it's not enough. Amid the frustration, concern that so
many manufacturing jobs have gone overseas, which raises a provocative
question. If Americans bought more products made in America, would it
make a difference? And would giving up all those products made with
cheap labor overseas be too expensive?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
All week long, my colleagues at World News with Diane Sawyer have
been reporting on their effort to answer that question. Here are the
highlights from their series, "Made in America."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We need to out-innovate, out-educate,
and out-build the rest of the world.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
OBAMA: We want to create and sell products all over the world
that are stamped with three simple words, made in America. That's our
goal.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
DAVID MUIR: We searched all over the country for one very brave
and willing family. Meet the Usrys (ph). Mom, dad, son, daughter,
and the dog, Amber. They were like so many other families who told
our producers their house must be filled with plenty that is made in
America.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would like to think we buy more American
than the typical family.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: But what would happen when we start to pick things up?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is made in China.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the cross?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Honduras.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Made in Honduras.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You're covering the world here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Made in Thailand.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Usually you're looking at what's on the
plate, not underneath it, right?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So here's the test.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The table is made in Thailand.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: And the chairs?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mexico.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: And we had a fork from?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Saint Pattern's (ph).
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: This one's from Korea.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: China.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And the plate is from Japan.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is there anything made in America on this
table?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It doesn't appear to be that way.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: Even the children's rooms.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
What about your Texas hat here?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's see. Bangladesh.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: So this is your room, huh? And little Ellis. And her
prized American Girl dolls. Right there, what does it say? Made in
--
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: China.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: In the 1960s, nine of every 10 products Americans bought
were made in America. Today, more than half of what we buy is foreign
made. So we wondered, could the Usrys manage without any foreign made
products at all?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
So we're going to ask you, if you would leave your own house in
our hands? And they did.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Bye, David.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: You're really going to leave me with your house?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's all yours.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: Take one last look.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Back inside, we kept going. It was every room of the house. The
bedroom. The bedspread, Pakistan. Night stand, Indonesia. The lamp,
China.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
This is where it's all going. Anything foreign made from inside
that house, right in here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The stove, ripped out. The refrigerator, gone. The piano. That
is a heavy piano. And every inch of that trailer filled. And with
the sun setting, the Usrys were about to return to this. And this.
And this. Their living room, with one lone vase.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
What do you think?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow. It's quite barren.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All of our appliances are gone.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: We did leave the kitchen sink because the kitchen sink was
the only thing made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything but the kitchen sink. Thank
you.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: But now would come the real challenge. Helping the family
scour the country for items to replace what we took away.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Enter the best shopper I know. Armed with her Blackberry and her
laptop, Sharyn Alfonsi.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SHARYL ALFONSI: Hi.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ALFONSI: We immediately started working the computer and decided
to start small.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Hi, I'm trying to find out if a certain coffee maker was made in
the USA. What's made in America?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Frustrating, but worth asking, because economists say if we all
just spend 1 percent more on American made goods right now, 18 cents a
day, that would be 200,000 new jobs today.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And then the moment that made even us sweat. The trucks. All
six of them coming down Snow White Drive. Would it be enough to fill
this home?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow, our American-made room. Oh, wow, wow.
This looks great. All American-made?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ALFONSI: All American made.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: Twenty-four hours ago, you thought this was impossible?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We did.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you saw how empty the house was.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A little bit skeptical that we'd be able to
pull it off. Or you guys.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: We were skeptical, too. But we found it. In fact, too
many American companies to count. Just the living room. Harden,
upstate New York. Lee Industries, North Carolina. Mohawk rugs,
Georgia. The drapes, New Jersey. And the mirror, Missouri.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But it doesn't come cheap. At least not everything. The lamp,
$250. But the drapes, just $40 at J.C. Penney. Remember that first
label we checked?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is made in China.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: That cost them $80. And the American options we found of
comparable quality, the same price range, a little cheaper, $73 up to
$89. The one loaned to us with the rest of the furniture, $250. We
paid the shipping.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ALFONSI: And the kitchen. Just when we ripped that stove out of
the wall, we realized we were in trouble. Yes, we scooped up
fiestaware for $35 and the glasses for less than a dollar. But then
the appliances.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The only 100 percent American-made appliances we could find were
the legendary Viking, Subzero, and Wolf. High end and highly
expensive. But there was another option, a compromise. We did find
some appliances half-made in the U.S. and they were about half the
cost of what we bought.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: The old bedroom set, $1,758. The new one, $1,699. The
American goods, less expensive, and just as durable. And those
workers who made it all in their Virginia factory, so proud to tell
us, made in America.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, now I'm with Diane Sawyer, and the team who put
this series together, David Muir and Sharyn Alfonsi. Thank you all.
And it is quite stunning to see a house which is then completely
emptied of everything, because nothing was made in America.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
DIANE SAWYER, ABC NEWS: You just start from the question, how
much of in your shopping cart was made in America? How much of what
you have in the living room, around you right now as you're watching?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What kind of reaction did you get?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SAWYER: Most people think about half. Isn't that what we --
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SAWYER: Yes, at least half. And then the revelation. And that
was the first thing we wanted to do. It's just a wakeup call about
the reality around us.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We know it's a global economy, but the thousand pressure points
that create what really establishes jobs.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
However, I loved knowing that my neighbors are making things that
I'm buying. That's one factor among other factors. We thought people
should start asking the question.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What really will put the jobs back where they're meant
to be here in this country?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ALFONSI: Well, if you look at it, every economist we spoke to
say, you might say it seems very simple, but the reality is, if you
make something in America, it creates American jobs. It is that
simple. At the same time, of course it's more complex than that. We
don't want to be bemoaning the loss of the lightbulb. We don't make a
single lightbulb in the United States. What we want to be thinking
about is the next lightbulb and being -- manufacturing in smart areas,
in areas that create high-value jobs.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: It's funny, economists say don't worry about the plasma
screen that we had to remove from the Usrys' house. They have no TV
in the living room or their bedroom now. They said we should be
thinking about the next generation of televisions that interconnect
the Internet and On Demand and everything else.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: And to get that next generation of innovators, you're
going to need the next generation of great education. Where does that
really play into this manufacturing debate?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SAWYER: Well, it's everything, as we know. And we think that if
you look at the whole path ahead for the -- for America, for what we
want to achieve, you see the convergence of what we are making, what
our aspirations are, and is our education serving what we want to be?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Thank you so much. And Diane and the team will be
continuing their made-in-America reporting in this next week and in
the next several weeks.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And when we come back, my exclusive interview with Senator John
McCain. I'll ask him about jobs, as well as the escalating violence
in Libya and what can be done about it. Stay with us.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Welcome back. Senator John McCain has one eye on the
jobs picture here in the United States and another on the unfolding
revolutions in the Middle East. And he's just returned from a trip to
the region, so we have lots to talk about today. And we're glad to
have him here with us at the Newseum.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Senator McCain, thank you for joining us.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Thank you.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Let me ask you first about the report that we just
saw. What does it say to you about that empty house but particularly
its impact on jobs here in the United States?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Well, I think it's obviously a recognition of the
reality and the trends, that cheaper, lower-cost labor products will
usually prevail over the products made in higher wage and income
countries.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But I would also point out that, if you'd emptied that house, if
you'd left a computer there or an iPad or an iPhone, those are built
in the United States of America. And as the president said,
continuously, and I agree with him, innovation is the key to us being
able to restore our economy.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And that's got to be exports. We've got to have free trade
agreements. I'm glad the president is supporting the South Korea free
trade agreement. We basically abandoned Colombia and Panama. All
these other countries are concluding free trade agreements amongst
themselves while we are being left behind. And that's very harmful.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Small statistic: two years ago, 40 percent of the imports of
agricultural goods in Colombia were from the United States of America.
They concluded free trade agreements. Now 20 percent is there. So we
have the ability to outcompete any other country in the world and
outinnovate.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, to that end, then, what do you make, and how do
you react to the good job news over the last month, that 192,000 more
jobs have been added and the unemployment rate has dipped below 9
percent? <!-- page -->
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: I think that's good. And I still worry about the
housing situation. And my state of Arizona is one of those that
suffered most from the collapse. And we still have nearly 50 percent
of the homes are still underwater.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But you've got to look at it as good news. But you also have to
recognize that we need to do more. Even at this present rate, we
would not be able to see a significant drop in unemployment for a very
long time. But it is encouraging news.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, what about the budget battle right now, the $61
billion in cuts, which even Mark Zandi, who was one of your advisers,
has said could lose 700,000 jobs.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: You know, he's the same guy that said that, if we
adopted the stimulus package, unemployment would never go above 8
percent. Please.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: But do you think these steep cuts will affect the
employment?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: I don't think so. But what I do know, that unless we
get our fiscal house in order, we are facing a calamity. There is no
way you can avoid that. So let's -- we did a $787 billion stimulus
package. We went on a spending spree over the last 10 years, a lot of
it -- some of it, at least, under Republican administrations, as well
as Democrats.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We have got to get our budget balanced. And that's -- that's
vital to the future. And by the way, it has to include Social
Security reform, Medicare, and Medicaid reform. Anybody who thinks we
can do that with 12 percent to 15 percent of the budget or make those
kinds of changes on that small a percentage of the budget is just
wrong.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: And we're going to be debating this afterwards. But,
obviously, a big element of the recovery here is linked, to an extent,
to the Middle East, where you've just been, the rising gas prices.
And of course, there, so many of the revolutions are about jobs as
well.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Let's go first to Libya. You have called for some kind of
intervention, a no-fly zone. Do you still maintain that position, to
have a no-fly zone over Libya?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Yes, I do. Senator Kerry and Senator Lieberman and I,
and others, have called for that.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
I would like to point out their air assets are not large. Their
air defenses are somewhat antiquated. And this would send a signal to
Gadhafi that the president is serious when he says we need for Gadhafi
to go. And also, it would be encouraging to the resistance, who are
certainly outgunned from the air.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But these air assets that the Libyan -- that Gadhafi has are not
overwhelming. They're not -- you know, not saying they aren't a
challenge, but...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: So how do you respond, then, to what Secretary Gates
said?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We're going to play what he said about this idea of a no-fly
zone.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT M. GATES: There's a lot of frankly
loose talk about some of these military options. And let's just call
a spade a spade. A no-fly zone begins with an attack on Libya to
destroy the air defenses. That's the way you do a no-fly zone.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(END VIDEO CLIP)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Do you think that it is, as he says too difficult,
that it's loose talk, when it comes to talk about a no-fly zone?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: I have great respect for Secretary Gates and the
outstanding job that he has done. We can't risk allowing Gadhafi to
massacre people from the air, both by helicopter and...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What he's really doing is attacking military
installations, ammunition depots and potentially a rebel army. If the
U.S. does get involved, is that taking sides?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Well, clearly, we are on the side of the rebels. We
have called for Gadhafi's removal. That's the president of the United
States' policy.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But, again, I want to emphasize. Ground intervention would not
be appropriate, certainly not at this time. A ground intervention by
the part of the United States could be very counterproductive. But we
can assist in a lot of ways, humanitarian, intelligence, providing
them with some training and other things that we could do as they form
up a provisional government in Benghazi.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: You mentioned what the president said, calling for
Colonel Gadhafi to step aside. I mean, when the president says he's
got to go, presumably he has to go. How does that happen? How does
one get him to go?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Well, first of all, I hope that Gadhafi understands the
inevitability of...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: But he hasn't shown...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Oh, I agree...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: ... much indication to us.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: He's insane. But perhaps the people around him would
begin to depart the sinking ship, and by, again, a no-fly zone,
declaring our assistance or support of a provisional government,
perhaps which is being formed up now. There's a lot of steps we can
take, providing significant humanitarian aid.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Look at this humanitarian crisis. It's huge on -- on both
borders. So I think there's a lot we could do, including intelligence
capability and giving them technical assistance.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: And in terms of where you've just come back from,
Egypt and other parts of that -- of that area, many people look with
great optimism to what's going on. Some are pessimistic. How can the
United States help manage the transition?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: First of all, by not appearing to interfere or dictate.
There's a lot of skepticism in Egypt and Tunisia and other countries
about -- because of our support of past rulers.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But offer assistance -- perhaps the most important thing we could
do in the long run for these countries is investment. Because you
know this was all about jobs.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
I'd love to see our high-tech CEOs go over there and say, OK,
we're going to invest. But we need to give them incentive to do so,
like a trade preference agreement, which we could enact immediately.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
This is really about the economy of these countries. And,
finally, there's so much to cover, Christiane. I don't mean to insult
your intelligence. But really, Egypt is the key to all of this...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Everybody says that.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: ... the heart and soul of the Arab world. The other
countries are very important. But maybe we could fail in one of those
other countries. We fail in Egypt, it has severe consequences.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: So much more to discuss, Senator McCain.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(LAUGHTER)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Thank you so much for joining us.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: Thanks for having me on.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Thank you.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MCCAIN: And when we return, how do we create jobs in America?
Is buying American the answer? If not, what is?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We take up that discussion after this.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
OBAMA: One of the things that I think there is a misconception
about is that somehow our manufacturing days have passed. that's not
true. we're still one off the dominant manufactures in the world.
the challenge, the difference is, is that what used to take 1,000
people to manufacture might now take 100.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MITT ROMNEY, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS: You see row after
row of textile mill buildings and you know when you see those
buildings that this state had to have gone through an economic crisis
at one point. It's going to take more than a speech in this part,
more than rhetoric to put the Americans back to work. It's going to
take a new president of the United States.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(END VIDEO CLIP)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Mitt Romney, last night in New Hampshire, the
presidential
campaign clearly well under way. And jobs will be at the very heart
of it. Today, the number of Americans in manufacturing jobs is at a
70-year low. And as you have just seen, ABC has asking an intriguing
question this week if each American spent just a little bit more on
American-made products, would it put more people back to work?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
So joining me to discuss that is mu ABC News colleague David
Muir, Leo Gerard, president of the United Steel Worker, Chrystia
Freeland, global editor at large for Thompson Reuters, and Mort
Zuckerman, editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Thank you for being here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Let me start with you, ladies first, Made in America, that report
that we just saw, is that the answer?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
FREELAND: No. I mean, I thought it was a terrific report, but,
you know, we are not going to go back to a world in which everyone
buys goods just made in their own country. And that's a good thing.
You know, trade helps the world economy. And I don't think we want to
push a line that says, well, if all Chinese people only bought goods
made in China, all German people only goods made in Germany that
wouldn't be great for American companies that do business around the
world.
Having said that, what I really liked about the report was
focusing on the notion that giving up on manufacturing is really a
mistake. And I think we did have a rhetoric in the past sort of, you
know, 20 years that said, you don't need to make things in a country
anymore. That's a mistake.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: We're not going to go back for all those traditional
things being made in America. Is that bad for your people?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: No. I think what we've got to recognize, though, is
we've had 25 years of record-breaking trade deficits. And in those 25
years America has gone from being the world's largest creditor nation
to the world's largest debtor nation. And that's because we're not
playing on a level playing field and America has no manufacturing
policy.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And so we can succeed if we have end up having a manufacturing
policy that puts out at as equal footing not one that puts us behind
the 8 ball with China as an example.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Level playing field, is that the answer? How does one
achieve that?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: Well, I don't know that you can get a level playing
field, because I don't know exactly what that means. We can't compete
on several levels with China and other countries like that,
particularly in terms of labor costs. It's just not going to work.
But there are many things we can do. And we have to appeal to our
strengths not to our weaknesses. Low cost labor is never going to be
our strength. America is past those days. But we have to have a
highly educated workforce to focus on the industries of the future and
to find ways to really develop those industries.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And another thing that we could do, which would really help a lot
of companies focus on America is to have a tax code that makes sense
so that you eliminate these special preferences and lower overall tax
rates. Canada, for example, has a corporate tax rate of 16.5 percent,
because they've eliminated a lot of those crap.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Let me just ask David about a statistic...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Let me make a point on taxes though. We're giving
companies tax breaks to move jobs overseas when we ought to be giving
people tax breaks to create jobs here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: On that issue about creating jobs. In your report, in
the series, there was an amazing statistic about just how much more an
American should pay every day, or every year, to create hundreds of
thousands of new jobs.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: We talked to a number of economists on this, as you know,
Christiane. Mark Zandi for one said, if we pumped $20 billion into
the economy in the next year, if every American spent that would be
the equivalent of $64 in the next year we could actually create
200,000 jobs.
But I wanted to answer what Chrystia said about buying only Made
in America or only Made in German, only -- that's a giant leap from
what the question was that was posed this week. These economists told
us unanimously that all things equal, durability, price, that if you
want to buy a cabinet from up the street from the furniture store, or
a product at your retail outlet that says Made in America, you're not
going to throw off the global trade balance. And you will help create
a job in America. They said it's as simple as that.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
FREELAND: What I liked about David's report, at the end when you
were refurnishing that house, the Viking stove was the one appliance
you found that was 100% made in America. And I think that's the kind
of place you should see America focusing on.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Hang on a sec. The high-end manufacturing. It's something where
if you look at western industrialized economy's, Germany is one
country that has been really successful at hanging on to
manufacturing. And that's because as Mort was saying, they haven't
focused on the cheap stuff. They've said what we can do that is
special is the super specialized stuff. It requires a highly educated
work force.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Germany has a manufacturing strategy. We don't. And
the reality is when you talk about the high end stuff, the iPad and
the iPhone are made in China, they're not made in America. If you
look at a modern wind turbine invented in Sandusky, Ohio we can't make
a wind turbine from start to finish, because we've never had a
strategy.<!-- page -->
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: So what is the strategy? If America doesn't have one,
why not? Because it is, by far, still the biggest manufacturer in the
world.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: We have never had that kind of state intervention in
terms of an industrial policy. That's not been the way the American
system works. But we actually put handicaps on it in this sense, I
mean, we have health care costs that are so dramatically higher than
everybody else that people want to ship jobs abroad. We have taxes
that makes absolutely though sense. There are a lot of special
benefits for individual companies, individual industries. We ought to
eliminate as many of those as we can and lower the tax rates so that
there's more of an opportunity to develop and do business here in the
United States. There are some things we can do.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We should have an infrastructure policy rather than an industrial
policy which would make it a lot easier for the private sector to
work. We have absolutely -- those would create many, many jobs and
would be a great stimulus for our economy.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Mort and I probably disagree on the words, because I
think if you have an infrastructure strategy, you have in fact got a
manufacturer strategy. We don't have any strategy. And when people
keep talking about low-priced goods, low-priced goods they have an
expensive cost. Low-priced goods with China where we've accumulated
almost a $2 trillion deficit with China have meant hundreds of
thousands of people unemployed. It's meant poison in our kids toys.
It's meant lead in our steel that we have had to send back. The Bay
Bridge is three years behind schedule because they bought Chinese
steel that won't hold the welds.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
FREELAND: You're not saying we should stop buying things from
China or stop trading with China?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: No. I'm not saying we should stop trading. In fact, no
country can survive without trade. What I'm in fact saying is that we
have got to have some set of rules on which we trade by. Our union
filed nine trade cases against China and won every one. Why are we
winning them? Because they cheat. At the very least we should ask
for an economy where we're not cheated.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: Just back from China. And I think Leo would agree on this
point, correct me if I'm wrong, but we have to pick which items we
want to compete with. I mean, we were in these Chinese factories,
south of Shanghai, as you know Christiane. In one factory that makes
one-third of all the socks in the world. I mean, America doesn't want
to make socks anymore. We don't want to compete with that. We want
to compete with the products...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: We're going to continue this right after the break.
Lots to talk about. We're going to break. And we'll come back and
continue.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Up next, Washington's answer to the job crisis. Will the deep
budget cuts on the table stick a fork in the recovery?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Coming up next, will the budget battle in Washington
have an impact on jobs?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And from the Middle East, the latest on the civil war in Libya.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And the women behind the revolutions, are they the best hope for
real democracy in the region?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: President Obama says the United States needs to build
on the momentum of Friday's upbeat jobs reports. The progress is
clearly fragile and the budget battles in Washington will certainly
have an impact, say many analysts. The question is -- what will that
impact be?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Joining me again here in the Newseum, my ABC colleague David
Muir. Leo Gerard, president of the United Steel Workers. Chrystia
Freeland, global editor at large for Thompson Reuters. And Mort
Zuckerman, editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Let's just go back to the lightbulb and finish that rather heated
debate.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: Well, it's interesting, because we were talking about
China. And the workers in those factories make $14 a day, $270 a
month, and they send much of it back to their child who's being raised
by the grandparents in rural China. We could never survive competing
against China in certain respects. We have got to pick--
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: We've got to pick which products.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
MUIR: They say the answer are multiplier products, the ones that
take multiple people to get it from start to finish. But Leo saw the
reporting this week and brought us this, about a lightbulb here in
America. This is what I love.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: The Ashram Sylvania Super Saver lightbulb has no mercury
in it. It's the most energy-efficient lightbulb invented so far. We
can hardly get it sold in America.
MUIR: But who knew about it?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Who knew about it?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, who knew? Why not?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Because of the onslaught of Chinese products, you can't
get it put in the store. I mean, it's a totally different discussion
about how you get on Wal-Mart's shelf or how you get on the shelf at
Home Depot or the big box stores.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What about the key issue of human capital? With
technology, sort of, you know, replacing the workforce -- what about a
55-year-old guy who is making x and now doesn't have that job? How
does one retrain him?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Three quick points on that. First of all --
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Or woman.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Men or women. There's training adjustment assistance
that was cut by the Republicans in the last budget that we need for
the people who are 55 and older. We have got 40 percent unemployment
in the trades, so we're having a hard time getting apprentices done.
Most of our manufacturing workplaces, we lost 55,000 factories during
the Bush era, 2,800 factories as the result of the Wall Street
collapse. Those factories used to train apprentices. Now they're
barely scratching to get back. And we have got to train, we've got to
get our community colleges ramped up, and we've got to get people
getting back--
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: This is the problem. The cutting of spending on
education.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: The jobs -- the -- most jobs are created by start-up
companies. OK? A huge part of them come from people who have
intellectual or educational knowledge, MAs and PhD's in the hard
sciences. Roughly 50 percent of the graduate degrees in the hard
sciences are foreign students. We have reduced the number of foreign
students we have allowed to stay and work in this country from 195,000
in the year 2000 to 65,000 today.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
This is absolutely criminal.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What does it mean?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: It means we do not have the intellectual power.
These people go back to their own countries. There -- and they start
the high-tech companies.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
I'll give you an example. The computer was built in the United
States, developed and built in the United States. Andy Grove wrote
about it. We now have 166,000 jobs in the computer industry in the
United States, but 1.5 million jobs are overseas. This is exactly
what's wrong.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: That is a manufacturing company. We have to train --
just a minute. We have got to keep the intellectual capabilities and
the educational capabilities to put high-value added products into the
stream of this country's economy. Because if we don't, we're going to
lose that, and then we'll really be lost.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
FREELAND: I totally agree with you, Mort. And that piece that
Andrew Grove wrote was very interesting, but his point was that
America is really good at inventing stuff. And if you look at who are
the big leading edge high-tech companies in the world, they're still
American. Right? It's Apple. It's Google. It's Facebook. We're
seeing a revolutionary effect.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But what is not happening is the follow-on jobs for hundreds of
thousands of people are not there. Apple is a good example.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: I want to ask you about the budget cuts as well.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Let me make this last point. One of the things that is
wrong is that for the last 30 years in both the United States and
Canada, we have told our kids, you have got to go to school and become
financial engineers. What we should have been doing is getting more
mechanical engineers.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
It's not our fault. It's the system that said you ought to go to
school and become a financial engineer. We've got too many financial
engineers--
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: Financial services is a major industry in this
country. We don't tell kids what to do. We can make it very
attractive for kids to go into the hard sciences.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: Tell them they'll make $28 million.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ZUCKERMAN: And have the jobs available. Not everybody thinks in
terms of going into the financial industry.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: $61 billion of budget cuts. Mark Zandi says 700,000
jobs will be lost.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
FREELAND: I think he's right. I mean, I think that, you know,
the problem is the U.S. government at both the federal and the state
level needs to figure out how to walk and chew gum at the same time.
So what you need to do is find a way in the medium term to have a
full, a sold promise to the markets, we're going to deal with
essentially the health care problem.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GERARD: We lost 55,000 factories that don't pay taxes anymore.
Each one of those workers employed four more workers.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: David, Leo, Chrystia, Mort, thank you very much
indeed, and this is a conversation that will just keep continuing.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We've seen them on the front lines of the protests sweeping the
Middle East. But what is next for the women of those revolutions?
Will they be as active in shaping the future of their region? And can
the prominent role they have played be a spoiler for Islamic militants
looking to take advantage of those upheavals? A powerhouse roundtable
coming up next. And Tina Brown will be on hand to unveil the new and
improved Newsweek magazine.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Welcome back, and now we turn to those revolutions
rocking the Middle East. There are reports of escalating violence in
Libya today. Rebel fighters clashing with Gadhafi loyalists. A lot
of uncertainty about how much territory the rebels actually control.
It has of course been a truly historic last few weeks in Libya and
throughout the Middle East and North African region. Many things have
changed, not just governments, but the people themselves, and perhaps
especially the women. Their influence could well have a huge impact
on what happens next. ABC's Lama Hasan has been in the region
throughout and has this report now from Libya.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: The wave of change sweeping across the Arab world has
finally given women a voice. Everywhere I went in the region, I was
impressed and surprised by the women I saw. Something changed. A
barrier was broken. They felt empowered and determined to bring down
regimes.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (inaudible), we never want (ph) you (ph)!
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: Mothers dragging their children along so they could
witness history. Girls who were not shy about mixing with boys,
standing shoulder to shoulder with them to fight for their cause.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Here in Libya, with the protests now giving way to the armed
rebellion, it's the work being done by Dr. Iman and her sister, Salwa,
a lawyer, behind the scenes, that is making a difference in keeping
the momentum of this revolution going.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SALWA BUGAIGHIF, LIBYAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Everything is not
easy. But if there is a will, there is a way. We'll have to go to
the end.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: With no specific role, they deal with whatever is thrown
at them. Everything from listening to worried fathers whose sons are
fighting on the front line to keeping up with the day to day clashes
and casualty numbers, to having meetings about health and educational
issues in a new, free eastern Libya.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
DR. IMAN BUGAIGHIF, LIBYAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: It consumes a
lot, but it's just amazing that we don't feel the time. We come here
from morning and we don't feel tired.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: It's easy to see how crucial they are to the movement.
No sooner are they done with one informal hallway meeting, they're
pulled into the next one. Even our cameraman struggles to keep up
with them, and they are modest.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
I. BUGAIGHIF: We're not the heroes. The heroes are the mothers
who are encouraging their children to go and fight for freedom. And
they know it may be the last time they will see them.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: These weren't the first women I'd encountered during the
last amazing two months. The revolution has spread like a fever
across the Middle East. In Egypt, women, especially young women, have
helped lead the uprising, blogging, tweeting, organizing, making their
views heard any way they can, for the first time in full partnership
with men.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We will not give up. <!-- page -->
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: 24-year-old Gigi Ibrahim is one of the faces of the
Egyptian revolution. An outspoken activist, Ibrahim was shot in the
back with a rubber bullet during the protests in Tahrir Square. That
didn't stop her.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
GIGI IBRAHIM, EGYPTIAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: I was more
determined, I think. This is what helped the revolution. People died
for this. Hundreds were willing to die for this to continue and
succeed. And this is the price of democracy and freedom.

HASAN: Worried about her safety, her family begged her not to
demonstrate.

me.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
HASAN: Rallying them to come out in big numbers to fight for

Arab world.

AMANPOUR: And the big question, how much will the newly
empowered women of the Middle East shape their emerging democracies?
It's something the United States, as well as much of the world, is
looking at closely.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Tina Brown, editor in chief of the Daily Beast and Newsweek, is
joining us. And she's hosting a women of the world summit this week.
Some of the women involved are joining us now. Dr. Nawal el Saadawi,
a long-time activist for women's rights in Egypt. Zainab Salbi, the
Iraqi founder of Women for Women International. And Sussan Tahmadebi,
who has been at the forefront of the struggle for women's rights in
Iran.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Ladies, thank you for joining us. Who could fail to be
optimistic? When you look at that piece, do you think gains are
solidified and set in stone?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SALBI: No. When I look at this piece, I first get emotional to
see that women are rising up and joining men in the streets. I also
remember history, history where women in the Middle East have rose up
before, participated in revolutions against French colonialism in
Algeria, against the shah of Iran. So we have that history, but it
often gets hijacked at the moment of their victory. We often get sent
back home.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, let's discuss that. Tina Brown, you are also
going to show us the new cover of "Newsweek," which we're going to put
up. And it is about 150 women who shape the world with Hillary
Clinton as the cover.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
What can somebody like the U.S. secretary of state and the rest
of the global community do to help these women in these revolutions?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
BROWN: Well, I think what is interesting right now is that
Hillary Clinton, in fact, has actually met her moment, in a sense,
because her long-held conviction has always been that women are the
leading indicators. That women, if you empower women, you're going to
make huge changes in the democracy movement and of course in the GDP
of the countries concerned. And she's been pounding that drum for a
long time.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
So this issue of Newsweek, you see her really in action, what she
is doing. We followed her to, for instance, on a trip to Yemen, just
a few weeks before the Arab revolution, and saw her conducting a very
robust town hall, where people were being encouraged to talk, women
were being encouraged to ask about women's rights. And after that
meeting, she met with a few of the women who clustered around her and
asked them, said, can you help us educate women here? About the
country here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: So education and helping with civil society and
democracy.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
BROWN: And also doing away with the barbaric custom, for
instance, of child brides. But they did also say, not in such a way
as to get us blowback. So it's all about how do you do that without
big-footing the whole atmosphere.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, Nawal, here we are in your country. It has now
got a revolution in place. A military committee is still running it.
How are women's rights going to be enshrined in Egypt? Not even on
the committee to write the constitution.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: I look at women's rights as global and local. And
we cannot be liberated in Egypt in a country that is not liberated.
Our problem is colonialism. I am here in New York, in Washington, and
I want to speak to you, Americans, and the government. It's the
problem of colonialism.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: What do you mean by that?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: I mean, that, you know, if we are independent, if
we're producing our food, then we will be OK. Now 50 percent of the
people in Egypt earn under $2 a day because of American neo-
colonialism (ph). You see. So women cannot be liberated in a country
not liberated. You see?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Is that right?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(CROSSTALK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: You see, I have to link that. It cannot be --
women's issues are not -- are global issues, local issues, politics,
economics. It's everything.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: No one is talking about the real big picture here.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SALBI: I would say we need to look at what happens to women as
an indicator for the direction of a society. Usually we look at what
happens to women as a marginal issue on the side. We need to shift
that. Women are bellwether for the society. Progress starts with
women and violence starts with women. And so rather than not worrying
about preservation of women's rights in the constitution or labor
laws, for example, which the Middle East still don't have equal rights
for women, or education, or employment opportunities. We need to look
at that as actually very important indicator for what is going to
happen in Egypt or Afghanistan or Iraq or whatever countries that
we're talking about.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Sussan, everybody is looking at the revolutions and
thinking, oh, my goodness. We saw this in Iran 30 years ago. Women
were on the streets in Iran, demanding something different than the
monarchy. And then a year later after the revolution, they were on
the streets again, complaining about being forced to wear the veil.
How is this not going to happen in this region and particularly in
Iran as well right now?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
TAHMASEBI: I think the -- I would have to agree with what Zainab
said. But I think the situation now is very different than 30 years
ago. And what Nawal said, it is the global context. And we have the
opportunity to really amplify women's voices in these countries.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
We're surprised to see women out in the revolutions and on the
streets. But the reality is for someone like myself, who lived in
Iran and worked in Iran, it's not surprising at all to see it in Iran,
to see it in Egypt because women are present. And wherever you are in
these countries, there are women who are advocating for women's
rights.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
And I think one way to do that is that women's movements
themselves need to be very vigilant in defending their rights. We
need to have regional opportunities to make women's rights an
indigenous issue and then global solidarity.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Tina, you know, everybody here obviously looks to this
not just as a woman's issue, but also sort of a big picture issue of
is this going to tamp down the whole idea of extremism, terrorism, is
this a big blow to al Qaeda for instance?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
BROWN: Well, if as Sussan right said, we have vigilant and the
women in these countries have to be supported in every conceivable
way. I mean, women like Nawal here have been working with this for
you know, 30, 40 years, doing brave acts and speaking out at a time
when -- Nawal was jailed for speaking out about feminist ideas and
this repressive society. So it's about vigilance, it really is, and
about doing everything America can to do it can to support and educate
without being clumsy about it, without going in and creating blow
back.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Because what happens -- what can happen is that suddenly it's
presented that the women's rights are an issue of foreign influence.
And once that happens, you know, this nationalistic Islamic fervor
starts to take place and the whole issue gets submerged. So it's
really, really important fur us to help them in every way we can with
the soft power aspect.
AMANPOUR: And Nawal, you have been doing this for decades. You
have seen in your region how -- just even in Egypt, let's talk about
the Muslim Brotherhood. Do you think the Muslim Brotherhood it is an
enemy of women in Egypt? And an enemy of real democracy?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: We have to look at this problem of religious
fundamentalism it's a universal problem.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: But particularly in Egypt with the Muslim Brotherhood,
do you think that they will allow...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: No.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Women to have full participation?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: I'm not afraid. They ask me, are you afraid of
Muslim brothers? No. I am afraid of local dictators, you know, the
one that will come after Mubarak and global dictators -- disunity.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Well, let me ask you to follow that.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: I didn't finish my comment. Because we are always
concentrating on local dictators who oppress women. We are oppressed
by both -- external powers. I am afraid of external powers, that's
the point -- it's related to my immigration (ph).
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Right, but that's kind of what I was talking about.
The external idea of oppression and also extremism, fundamentalism and
indeed terrorism.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
SALBI: Well, it's interesting because religious groups in the
Middle East have figured out that using women and utilizing women to
promote their issues is a good thing. In Iraq, for example, since
2003 it was religious groups, not secular groups, that incorporated
women in their elections and in their parties.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
In a way we need to learn, the secular groups need to learn from
the religious groups, by really giving the platform for women and
promoting women in leadership. We should not take the women's rights
for granted issue, because the other side is using it to advance their
own cause.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The issue is about family laws at the end of the day. The issue
is about mobility and access to resources for women. And usually,
that law is traded off. We get free trade, you get family law with
religious groups. This time, this is a secular revolution, this is
not a religious one. It is actually telling dictators as well as
fundamentalists the same thing, we are not going to tolerate this
anymore.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
So this is the -- it's a really critical point in here of do not
bargain women away. Do not bargain them in Afghanistan, do not
bargain them in Egypt. And that is really the point.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: And briefly, you are part of the million signatures
campaign. You started that. Where does the situation for women and
indeed the whole sort of protest movement, does that have any legs in
Iran?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: You mean, inside the protesters and in the region?
Well, I think...
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Everybody wants to see this uprising come to Iran. Do
you think there is any chance?
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
EL SAADAWI: Well, women in Iran have been fighting for their
rights for 100 years, especially before these recent developments,
they have been at the forefront of fighting for their rights and
fighting for democracy. And for nearly two years now after the
disputed president elections, people have been on the streets and have
been fighting at least for their votes initially.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
So I think that it's, you know, reflected and the same issues are
going on inside of Iran that they are in other places.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Thank you all so much. And we'll be watching the
women's summit, the Daily Beast Newsweek that's coming up this week.
So thanks very much for joining us. And we will be right back.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
AMANPOUR: Thank you for watching ABC News. We are always here
online at ABCnews.com And we hope you'll watch World News Sunday
later this evening. And I'll see you here next week.
