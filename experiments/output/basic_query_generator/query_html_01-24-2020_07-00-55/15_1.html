Kivisto of the School of Psychological Science at the University of Indianapolis said in a statement.</p><p>Kivisto and colleagues analyzed household gun ownership, homicide rate, and other data spanning from 1990 through 2016.<strong> </strong>They culled these data from a variety of sources, including the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, US Census, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Previous studies had shown an association between gun ownership and gun homicide rates, but suggested that it could differ depending on the relationship between the offender and the victim.

(In the study, the researchers noted that despite the existence of federal legislation design to curtail domestic gun homicides—such as the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Gun Control Act of 1968—there has been little enforcement of them, leading many states to enact their own legislation.) </p><p>States with laws that bar those with a risk of committing intimate partner violence from owning guns and require them to surrender any guns they already have, such as California and Illinois, show a lower incidence of domestic gun homicide.
