	<p><br/>Almost six years ago, bombs began to fall in Baghdad. Americans hoped for a quick end to Saddam Hussein&#39;s reign and a relatively quick and painless transition to a democratic Iraq.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 12px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span>&#0160;&#0160;<br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; It wasn&#39;t quick. And it wasn&#39;t painless. But on Friday, President Barack Obama signaled the end of the Iraq war. He praised America&#39;s armed forces for &quot;succeeding beyond any expectation&quot; in Iraq. He announced that combat troops would be out of Iraq by Aug. 31, 2010, and that all American troops would leave by the end of 2011.America will close the final chapter of the Iraq war and mark it down for the history books as a place where American political and military will was supremely tested. Where moments of inspiration were balanced by days of gruesome violence. Where American commanders found a way to win. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;I want to be very clear,&quot; Obama said in his speech before a military audience at Camp Lejeune on Friday. &quot;We sent our troops to Iraq to do away with Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime -- and you got the job done. We kept our troops in Iraq to help establish a sovereign government -- and you got the job done. And we will leave the Iraqi people with a hard-earned opportunity to live a better life -- that is your achievement; that is the prospect that you have made possible.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; You got the job done. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Obama&#39;s withdrawal plans have drawn criticism from some of his Democratic allies, who say the president will leave too many troops in Iraq for too long. He has stretched his own timetable. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; That criticism suggests a lack of faith in their new president&#39;s ability to make sound decisions based on the advice of his military commanders. Obama&#39;s plan is smart, careful and above all, flexible. It will be guided by commanders on the ground and by the conditions they face. It allows for 35,000 to 50,000 troops to remain after combat troops depart. Those remaining troops will help to train, equip and advise Iraqi security forces and conduct targeted counter-terrorism missions, as well as protect civilian and military efforts in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraq&#39;s government and security forces are gaining strength exponentially. Its political system is maturing with each peaceful, democratic election. Iraq will be ready to stand on its own. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Think back to the days when Iraq seemed certain to tilt into civil war, when suicide bombers struck at will, when &quot;mission accomplished&quot; sounded like a cruel joke. When there was no end in sight to a long, exhausting war.<br/></p>

	<p>One year ago, fresh American troops were dispatched as part of the &quot;surge&quot; into Baghdad to tamp down violence and allow political reconciliation. It has been a remarkable year, with violence plummeting and streams of emigres returning to Baghdad. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; And on Wednesday, Iraq&#39;s political leaders finally held up their end of the bargain. The Iraqi parliament did three things. It approved a budget, to start moving on crucial reconciliation projects. It passed a new law to define the scope of provincial powers, critical to power sharing. And it promoted reconciliation by granting a general amnesty for thousands of Iraqi prisoners.That&#39;s huge progress. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Yes, there&#39;s still much to do, and some skepticism about whether the Iraqi government will continue to follow through on its promises. But there should be no doubt that the increase in troops has brought a significant, welcome change in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; You wouldn&#39;t know that by listening to the Democratic presidential candidates or leaders in Congress. Last weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the surge &quot;a failure.&quot; Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have grudgingly acknowledged a glint of progress. But they&#39;ve programmed their Iraq comments in a way that suggests they haven&#39;t read a headline in a year. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; To accept that the surge is working requires a &quot;suspension of disbelief,&quot; Clinton said last September. Obama has tried some selective rewriting of history. He said last month that he predicted that &quot;given how wonderfully our troops perform ... we would see an improvement in the security situation and we would see a reduction in violence.&quot; But, as the Washington Post reported on Jan. 8, 2007, he said that in the absence of political progress, &quot;I don&#39;t think 15,000 or 20,000 more troops is going to make a difference in Iraq and in Baghdad.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Obama also suggested last month that Sunni tribes changed sides to battle Al Qaeda only after Democrats took the House and Senate in the 2006 election. &quot;I welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place, although I would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in Anbar province, Sunni tribes, who started to see, after the Democrats were elected in 2006, you know what, the Americans may be leaving soon. And we are going to be left very vulnerable to the Shias. We should start negotiating now.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The Sunni reversal certainly has been a key reason -- perhaps the key reason -- the surge has worked. But that reversal didn&#39;t happen after the November election. The tribes publicly announced that they&#39;d agreed to join forces against Al Qaeda in September 2006. The Sunnis flipped sides because of Al Qaeda savagery and brilliant diplomacy by American officers, and only after they became convinced the U.S. would not abandon them. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The fall campaign is now taking shape. And the contrast on Iraq couldn&#39;t be sharper. Sen. John McCain, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, staked his candidacy on supporting the surge. He says that more troops are needed to provide security, fight terrorists, disarm militias, train the Iraqi army and work with police units. Obama and Clinton call for beginning troop withdrawal or redeployment, while leaving a residual force to fight terrorists and maintain stability. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Progress, political and military, is fragile but real. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Just as American strategy has evolved on the ground in Iraq, so should the candidates&#39; approach to the war. That means the Democrats need to be more open about progress there. They need to be talking about how to leave Iraq when it is a stable Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; That also means McCain will have to acknowledge the enormous costs of this war -- already borne and going forward. It doesn&#39;t undercut his main point that to leave too quickly risks the collapse of Iraq and a chain reaction across the Middle East. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The U.S. has paid a high price for freedom in Iraq. It has a huge stake in protecting that freedom. It would be a mistake to abandon the effort.</p>

	<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demonstrated considerable prowess this week. She and her aides whipped Democrats into line to pass a bill in the House that would bring U.S. combat troops home from Iraq by no later than Sept. 1, 2008. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; She wielded all the political weapons at her command and eked out a victory, without a vote to spare. She enticed conservative Democrats, who fear such a deadline would tie the hands of U.S. commanders, largely by loading the bill with billions in pork-barrel spending. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; She persuaded liberals, who wanted an immediate cutoff of funds and withdrawal of troops, with some old-fashioned political arm-twisting and more pork-barrel spending. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; It was an impressive performance. But the House is ill-equipped to micromanage American forces on the ground in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The House plan puts pressure in the wrong place: on U.S. military commanders. It sets up a series of benchmarks and timetables. Even if President Bush certifies that the Iraqis are making sufficient progress, U.S. combat troops would be redeployed by Sept. 1, 2008, at the latest. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; We fervently hope that U.S. combat troops have completed their mission by that date. But the House plan starts to tie the hands of American commanders just when the troop surge seems to be showing the first tentative signs of working. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The 218-212 vote on the House plan showed the deep divide in Congress on this issue. The bill likely won&#39;t survive intact in the Senate, which is set to debate a plan for a squishier deadline for withdrawing troops. Even if the House plan did pass the Senate, Bush has vowed to veto it. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A stalemate between the president and Congress on a spending bill of this magnitude--about $124 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan--is not without dangers. Defense Secretary Robert Gates warned that failure to pass the bill soon &quot;will have a genuinely adverse effect on the readiness of the Army.&quot; He said it would force the Army to delay training of units and halt repair of vital equipment. Bush said Friday that if the spending bill is not signed into law by April 15, troops and their families &quot;will face significant disruptions.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Americans are understandably impatient about the war. They want the Iraqi government to stop dithering and start moving more quickly on benchmarks of political, military and economic progress. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Ultimately, however, it&#39;s the president&#39;s job--not lawmakers&#39;--to pressure the Iraqis. It&#39;s his role to let Iraq&#39;s leaders--and, just as important, the American people--know what will happen if they fail to meet their goals in a timely manner. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush still hasn&#39;t done that to anyone&#39;s satisfaction. But setting a date for withdrawal won&#39;t help the U.S. prevail in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Nor will it prevent Iraq from sliding into chaos. </p>

</h3><!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-content">

<div class="entry-body">
	<p>A restrained President Bush pleaded with Congress Tuesday night for time to let his new &quot;surge&quot; strategy in Iraq work. He clearly hopes to head off anti-surge resolutions now simmering in the U.S. Senate, and other potential congressional moves to limit his already-narrowed options in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; But it&#39;s telling--and sobering for the administration--that the war debate no longer follows partisan lines between Republicans and Democrats. Some of the most forceful voices lifted in recent days against sending 21,500 fresh troops to Iraq are from within Republican ranks. Earlier this week, the administration lost one of its staunchest allies, GOP Sen. John Warner, to the anti-surge surge. Warner offered a non-binding resolution opposing the president&#39;s plan to send more troops to secure Baghdad. And he enlisted two Republican moderates: Sens. Susan Collins and Norm Coleman. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; On Wednesday, a different resolution repudiating the president&#39;s war strategy--pushed by Democratic Sen. Joe Biden and supported by Republican Sens. Chuck Hagel and Olympia Snowe--was passed by the Foreign Relations Committee. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A debate on one or both is likely to start next week in the full Senate. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Warner insisted that his resolution was not intended to rebuke the president or to set timetables for withdrawal or troop reduction. Rather, he said, it was &quot;to express the genuine--and, I repeat, the genuine--concerns of a number of senators from both parties about the president&#39;s plan.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Those concerns are reflected across America. Some polls show Americans oppose the president&#39;s plan by a ratio of 2-to-1. They, like many in Congress, are increasingly convinced the president&#39;s Iraq strategy is taking the wrong track. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The two resolutions are strikingly similar in their alternative strategy for the war. Both focus on pushing Iraqi leaders to make compromises for the sake of unity. They back a U.S. military mission that conducts counterterrorism operations, trains and equips Iraqi forces and pursues more muscular diplomacy with Iraq&#39;s neighbors. The recent report from the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommended the same measures. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; By contrast, Bush&#39;s new plan to secure Baghdad rests heavily on a shaky Iraqi government. So far, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been unable or unwilling to take the tough actions to push his nation to confront the relentless sectarian violence. More time and more U.S. troops may simply buy more government inaction. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush says he is impatient. He says America&#39;s commitment is not &quot;open-ended.&quot; He says he has set &quot;benchmarks&quot; for the Iraqis. But he has been frustratingly vague on what they are and--most important--what happens if the Iraqis fail to meet them. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A non-binding resolution is purely symbolic. It won&#39;t stop the president&#39;s buildup. But Bush can&#39;t afford to ignore such resolutions or the fact that the ranks of his Republican allies on the war are dwindling. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The president has had two opportunities in recent weeks to fully explain how he plans to force the Iraqis to seize control of their own destiny. He hasn&#39;t done it. Until he does, he can expect more skepticism from Congress--and from many Americans. </p>

</h3><!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-content">

<div class="entry-body">
	<p>President Bush stood before his impatient citizenry Wednesday night to make three admissions: I have not committed enough troops to a war this nation must win. I have not forced Iraqi leaders to push past their sectarian squabbles to secure the destiny of their nation. There have been mistakes, and they have been mine. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; But he&#39;s not giving up on the Iraq mission, he essentially told Americans, and neither should they. America cannot afford to have its enemies--or its friends--see it in retreat from Islamic extremists of many stripes. The U.S. is in a struggle with purveyors of terror and hate. Losing is not an option. That&#39;s the correct goal. But is the strategy Bush articulated Wednesday night the right way of achieving it? <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush is sending more troops to Iraq. He&#39;s sending something else as well: warnings to Iraqi leaders. He has told Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki that American patience with his feckless government is not &quot;open-ended.&quot; He also has told al-Maliki that his country&#39;s fractious political leadership must meet benchmarks for national reconciliation. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush set out the benchmarks. Where his address was disappointingly vague was in setting out the consequences. He said the Iraqis risk losing the support of the American people and the Iraqi people. But that appears already to have happened, at least on these shores. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; America has set benchmarks before. And then it has retreated, fearful that too much pressure would undercut the Iraqi government and embolden the insurgency. The upshot: a confusing mix of signals from Washington to Baghdad. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Setting stark deadlines and consequences would have risks. The forces of chaos in Iraq could dial up their efforts as a way to ensure that the al-Maliki government would fail--and perhaps fall. That said, Baghdad needs to know it can&#39;t rely on endless supplies of U.S. troops. America has no other leverage but military and economic aid. Bush must be ready to use that leverage--and make sure that the Iraqis know it. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Over the weekend came the first evidence that the Iraqis may be heeding Bush&#39;s tough message. Al-Maliki declared that his Shiite-dominated government would crack down on Sunni Arab and Shiite militants with equal vigor. Now he must deliver. That puts a lot of pressure on al-Maliki, who has so far proven unable or unwilling to take action, particularly if it would rankle militia leader Moqtada Sadr, one of the prime minister&#39;s most powerful backers. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; At the same time, American military commanders need to make sure that pressure remains squarely on the Iraqis to bridge their differences. Another 21,000 American troops won&#39;t make much of a difference in the Baghdad inferno if Iraqi troops don&#39;t take charge to wipe out the militias and death squads, no matter the sect or affiliation. More troops won&#39;t make much difference if Iraqi leaders don&#39;t achieve political reconciliation. A strong government that represents all the people brings stability, not vice versa. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush faces skepticism from Congress and from weary Americans. A few weeks ago, former Secretary of State James Baker, a leader of the Iraq Study Group, noted that one word didn&#39;t appear much, if at all, in his group&#39;s report: Victory. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Wednesday night, the president made clear that &quot;victory&quot; is still in his vocabulary. It should be. Americans need a democratic Iraqi government, able to defend itself from extremists, in that difficult neighborhood. Iraq&#39;s leaders need to be much more aggressive in securing and building the new nation that they and their people need just as much.</p>

<div class="entry-body">
	<p>Fresh American troops may be headed to Iraq as part of a so-called &quot;surge&quot; to turn the course of the war. The effort is likely to mean a tour of duty for perhaps 10,000 or more U.S. troops, although the numbers and time frame are still in flux. <br/>If that is true, President Bush will need firm answers to overcome some intense public opposition. What will the troops&#39; mission be? A push to secure Baghdad? A move to train more Iraqi troops to take control of their country? A drive to vanquish the bloody Shiite militias of radical cleric Moqtada Sadr? A new offensive against the Sunni death squads and foreign terrorists tormenting the country? There are those who argue that security trumps all and that the troops should be used mainly to douse the relentless violence in Baghdad. That strikes us as short-sighted. It&#39;s a military solution to what has become mostly a political problem. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Yes, more troops might briefly tamp down violence in the capital, at least in some areas. But there&#39;s no guarantee of that; a similar attempt last fall failed. And remember, a surge is a temporary maneuver, designed to get quick results. If we know it, then the enemy does too. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; As the Iraq Study Group report said: &quot;Perpetrators of violence leave neighborhoods in advance of security sweeps, only to filter back later. Iraqi police have been unable or unwilling to stop such infiltration and continuing violence. ... Security efforts will fail unless the Iraqis have both the capability to hold areas that have been cleared and the will to clear neighborhoods that are home to Shiite militias.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; If there is a mission for a surge of American troops, it will be to help Iraq stand on its own sooner. That may mean doubling or tripling the number of American advisers in Iraqi units. It can&#39;t mean doing the job for them. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; As former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warned in an interview with columnist Cal Thomas published last month in the Tribune: &quot;The more troops you have--particularly American troops, who are so darn good at what they do--the more they will do things and the more dependent the Iraqis will become, and the less independent they will become.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; More troops means more targets for insurgents. More troops also feeds the image of America as an occupier, which may further fuel the insurgency. Gen. George Casey, the top-ranked commander in Iraq, added this caution: The more troops, the more Iraqi leaders &quot;can continue to blame us for all of Iraq&#39;s problems, which are, at base, their problems.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Their problems. That&#39;s about as candid as a serving general gets. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Prevailing in Iraq will require a different sort of surge, one of better trained, more committed Iraqi troops and military leaders. Most important, it will demand Iraqi political will. As the Iraq Study Group concluded: &quot;The fundamental cause of violence in Iraq ... is the absence of national reconciliation.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; So far, unfortunately, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his government have been unwilling or unable to take the tough political steps to reconcile all sects and factions. The disgraceful taunting of Saddam Hussein by his Shiite executioners provided an appallingly stark reminder of how divided--splintered--Iraq is. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; As Lt. Gen. Ray Odierno told Newsweek: &quot;You now have different groups ... trying to vie for power within Iraq. That&#39;s what makes this extremely more complex than this has been in the past. It&#39;s not simply Sunni insurgents or Al Qaeda that we&#39;re fighting anymore--fighting is the wrong term--we&#39;re trying to influence (Iraqis) to operate within the confines of the government.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A surge of American troops runs risks. It may buy the Iraqi government more time to avoid hard decisions. It may buy Iraqi leaders more time to not confront the Shiite militias that are fanning brutal sectarian violence. Or more time to avoid bringing Sunnis into a full political partnership and enlist their aid in reining in Sunni death squads. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; If Bush is to sell a new mission, it must be guided by one fact: Only the Iraqis can put an end to the violence. </p>

</h3><!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-body">
	<p>How will the world remember Saddam Hussein? Will it remember his barbarous reign, his heedless slaughtering of his own citizens? Will it remember a dictator so fickle and feared that he was misled by his own inner circle, told lies about his military prowess because no one dared tell the truth? A megalomaniac who could not conceive of a world in which he would be overthrown, after all the millions he had spent buying friends in Europe and Russia? <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; One thing is certain: He won&#39;t be remembered for his farewell letter, in which a seemingly humbled Hussein, sentenced to death, urged his fellow countrymen to think good thoughts. &quot;I call on you not to hate because hate does not leave space for a person to be fair and it makes you blind and closes all doors of thinking,&quot; he wrote. Hussein inspired enough hate among his own countrymen, particularly the Kurds and Shiites, to ensure that such a message could only be taken with a strong dose of irony. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The former dictator was hanged early Saturday in Iraq, only weeks after his conviction for crimes against humanity. If it was an unusually swift appeals process--and by American standards, it was warp speed--then it was also an open-and-shut case. Hussein and his henchmen were found guilty of rounding up and killing 148 Shiite Muslims from the northern Iraqi town of Dujail in 1982, in retaliation for an assassination attempt on Hussein there. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A separate trial was under way, this one on charges of genocide. Hussein was accused for his role in the so-called Anfal campaign against Iraqi Kurds, in which an estimated 180,000 people were killed. If Dujail was &quot;one snippet of life under&quot; Hussein&#39;s regime, Anfal showed the world &quot;in living color what life was like under Saddam,&quot; said Vanderbilt University law professor Michael A. Newton, quoted on the Council on Foreign Relations Web site. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Victims were tortured and shot. Some were exposed to chemical weapons. Many were buried in mass graves. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; It was something of a mystery how someone so coldly calculating could have so badly misjudged the events that led to his removal from power. If he didn&#39;t have weapons of mass destruction, why not come clean? <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Thanks to a fascinating article in Foreign Affairs, we don&#39;t have to guess about Hussein&#39;s monumentally flawed strategic decisions. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Based on interviews and seized documents, the authors concluded that Hussein believed the U.S. would not dare to attack Iraq. He believed that France and Russia would block U.S. action via the UN Security Council. If they failed, he believed his forces could inflict such enormous losses that the U.S. would retreat. At the very least, he believed foreign forces would never advance to Baghdad, that America would be satisfied with a result short of regime change. He believed that he would survive as ruler. That&#39;s why he didn&#39;t torch the oil fields. He figured he&#39;d need the money to prop up his regime. He wouldn&#39;t tell the truth about WMD because he feared such weakness might encourage attacks from outside. Even so, Hussein&#39;s biggest fear was an internal revolt. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Most telling, the authors in Foreign Affairs wrote, &quot;Saddam truly trusted only one person: himself. As a result, he concentrated more and more power in his own hands.&quot; And because he saw threats everywhere, he &quot;used a remarkable set of hiring criteria&quot; for those he needed to handle operational details. &quot;As one senior Iraqi leader noted, Saddam selected the `uneducated, untalented, and those who posed no threat to his leadership for key roles.&#39;&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; To the end, Hussein kept &quot;giving orders to deploy and maneuver formations that had ceased to exist. ... As he discussed the plan for the final defense of the city, another brigade of U.S. armor was busily chewing up the manicured lawn in front of his central palace.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Hussein&#39;s regime is believed to have murdered at least 300,000 Iraqis. He offered no mercy to his own people, and he deserved none from them. </p>

	<p>The long-awaited Iraq Study Group report landed with a thud on President Bush&#39;s doorstep Wednesday morning. It&#39;s grim reading. &quot;The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. There is no path that can guarantee success, but the prospects can be improved.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; What follows are 79 specific recommendations and lots of gloomy prose. Bush need not adopt every one of them, but he does need to accept that this is a broad and important strategy to rescue the struggling U.S. mission in Iraq.The panel&#39;s major points: <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - Squeeze Iraq: The U.S. should set benchmarks for the Iraqis--and threaten to withdraw military, political or economic aid if those benchmarks aren&#39;t reached. The biggest chip: pulling combat troops if the government fails to end its internal bickering and build a military strong enough to protect it. This carries a risk--that an American ultimatum would weaken Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; That said, the strategy is worth the risk. Leveraging a threat of withdrawal if sectarian rivalries don&#39;t recede would get the attention of Iraq&#39;s Sunni and Shiite leaders, particularly al-Maliki. Sunni leaders haven&#39;t felt pressure to quell the violent factions within their ranks; Shiites haven&#39;t felt pressed to make accommodations to Sunnis as long as U.S. forces provided the muscle to keep them in power. The threat of losing American support should, paradoxically, empower al-Maliki to force difficult compromises on his splintered government. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraqis need to solve their own problems, and Americans deserve to know that Washington is pressuring Baghdad to the max. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - Train and draw down: The study group says the U.S should accelerate the training of Iraqi troops and the hand-over of responsibility to them. As that proceeds, the U.S. could withdraw nearly all combat brigades by early 2008. This suggestion is the clearest winner in the report and the least surprising. It would intensify existing U.S. policy. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; By year&#39;s end, the U.S. will have trained an Iraqi army of about 138,000, the report states. More and better-disciplined Iraqi troops are needed. Training has multiple facets: Embedding more U.S. advisers in Iraqi units is the best way to improve their performance and to give Iraqis confidence that they can defend their government. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; That capability would serve U.S. interests far better than an abrupt U.S. withdrawal. Retired Gen. Anthony Zinni, who opposed the Iraq invasion and once served as top U.S. commander in the Mideast, warns that leaving Iraq swiftly would boost Iranian influence and invite more sectarian violence. &quot;This is not Vietnam or Somalia or those places where you can walk away,&quot; he told The New York Times. &quot;If we just pull out, we will find ourselves back in short order.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; This likely would mean a faster handoff than Bush has envisioned. He has said he won&#39;t pull U.S. troops off the battlefield until Iraq is stabilized and its government protected. But speeding the handoff is a concession the president should accept. U.S. commanders and Iraqi leaders are already pushing for this. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - Engage Iran and Syria. The Iraq panel urges a more muscular diplomatic effort, drawing in Iran and Syria, to help stabilize Iraq. This is worth a renewed effort; al-Maliki said earlier this week that he&#39;s already reaching out to those countries. Let&#39;s not get too optimistic. Granted, both countries could help curb violence. Iran could stop funding of major Shiite militias in Iraq. Syria could stop the surge of foreign fighters and Al Qaeda recruits across its border to join Sunni insurgents in Iraq. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Prospects are remote, however, that Tehran or Damascus, both of whom would love to see U.S. efforts fail in the region, will do much besides talk. Why? Because they have much more pressing items on their agendas--and the price of whatever limited cooperation they might be willing to surrender may well be too high. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; There is one possible opening for U.S. diplomacy with Iran and Syria: if both fear a growing regional conflict could send refugees over their borders and embolden their own restive minority populations. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - What the study group didn&#39;t propose: The debate within this country over Iraq has included two facile suggestions that the Baker-Hamilton panel plainly rejected: Set a timetable for an immediate pullout and partition Iraq into Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions. The first would condemn Iraqis who have embraced freedom and democracy--remember all those purple fingers?--to the furies of insurgents and terrorists; the second would isolate the oil-poor Sunnis and likely send refugees fleeing from region to region. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; One of the study group&#39;s key points isn&#39;t even in its report. A side letter from Baker and Hamilton warns in blunt, even scolding terms that a divided America needs to come together. &quot;Americans can and must enjoy the right of robust debate within a democracy,&quot; Baker and Hamilton write. &quot;Yet U.S, foreign policy is doomed to failure--as is any course of action in Iraq--if it is not supported by a broad, sustained consensus.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Broad, sustained consensus hasn&#39;t been this nation&#39;s strong suit of late. The Iraq Study Group offers a credible agenda that the White House, the Congress and the American people should embrace. </p>

</h3><!-- .entry-header -->

<div class="entry-body">
	<p>Did President Bush intentionally mislead this nation and its allies into war? Or is it his critics who have misled Americans, recasting history to discredit him and his policies? If your responses are reflexive and self-assured, read on.<br/>On Nov. 20, the Tribune began an inquest: We set out to assess the Bush administration&#39;s arguments for war in Iraq. We have weighed each of those nine arguments against the findings of subsequent official investigations by the 9/11 Commission, the Senate Intelligence Committee and others. We predicted that this exercise would distress the smug and self-assured--those who have unquestioningly supported, or opposed, this war. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The matrix below summarizes findings from the resulting nine editorials. We have tried to bring order to a national debate that has flared for almost three years. Our intent was to help Tribune readers judge the case for war--based not on who shouts loudest, but on what actually was said and what happened.The administration didn&#39;t advance its arguments with equal emphasis. Neither, though, did its case rely solely on Iraq&#39;s alleged illicit weapons. The other most prominent assertion in administration speeches and presentations was as accurate as the weapons argument was flawed: that Saddam Hussein had rejected 12 years of United Nations demands that he account for his stores of deadly weapons--and also stop exterminating innocents. Evaluating all nine arguments lets each of us decide which ones we now find persuasive or empty, and whether President Bush tried to mislead us. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; In measuring risks to this country, the administration relied on the same intelligence agencies, in the U.S. and overseas, that failed to anticipate Sept. 11, 2001. We now know that the White House explained some but not enough of the ambiguities embedded in those agencies&#39; conclusions. By not stressing what wasn&#39;t known as much as what was, the White House wound up exaggerating allegations that proved dead wrong. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Those flawed assertions are central to the charge that the president lied. Such accusations, though, can unfairly conflate three issues: the strength of the case Bush argued before the war, his refusal to delay its launch in March 2003 and his administration&#39;s failure to better anticipate the chaos that would follow. Those three are important, but not to be confused with one another. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; After reassessing the administration&#39;s nine arguments for war, we do not see the conspiracy to mislead that many critics allege. Example: The accusation that Bush lied about Saddam Hussein&#39;s weapons programs overlooks years of global intelligence warnings that, by February 2003, had convinced even French President Jacques Chirac of &quot;the probable possession of weapons of mass destruction by an uncontrollable country, Iraq.&quot; We also know that, as early as 1997, U.S. intel agencies began repeatedly warning the Clinton White House that Iraq, with fissile material from a foreign source, could have a crude nuclear bomb within a year. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Seventeen days before the war, this page reluctantly urged the president to launch it. We said that every earnest tool of diplomacy with Iraq had failed to improve the world&#39;s security, stop the butchery--or rationalize years of UN inaction. We contended that Saddam Hussein, not George W. Bush, had demanded this conflict. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Many people of patriotism and integrity disagreed with us and still do. But the totality of what we know now--what this matrix chronicles-- affirms for us our verdict of March 2, 2003. We hope these editorials help Tribune readers assess theirs. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE ROAD TO WAR: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION&#39;S NINE ARGUMENTS <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Biological and chemical weapons <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The Bush administration said Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction. Officials trumpeted reports from U.S. and foreign spy agencies, including an October 2002 CIA assessment: &quot;Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons, as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Many, although not all, of the Bush administration&#39;s assertions about weapons of mass destruction have proven flat-out wrong. What illicit weaponry searchers uncovered didn&#39;t begin to square with the magnitude of the toxic armory U.S. officials had described before the war. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; There was no need for the administration to rely on risky intelligence to chronicle many of Iraq&#39;s other sins. In putting so much emphasis on illicit weaponry, the White House advanced its most provocative, least verifiable case for war when others would have sufficed. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraq rebuffs the world <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; In a speech that left many diplomats visibly squirming in their chairs, President Bush detailed tandem patterns of failure: Saddam Hussein had refused to obey UN Security Council orders that he disclose his weapons programs--and the UN had refused to enforce its demands of Hussein. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Reasonable minds disagree on whether Iraq&#39;s flouting of UN resolutions justified the war. But there can be no credible assertion that either Iraq or the UN met its responsibility to the world. If anything, the administration gravely understated the chicanery, both in Baghdad and at the UN. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Hussein had shunted enough lucre to enough profiteers to keep the UN from challenging him. In a dozen years the organization mass-produced 17 resolutions on Iraq, all of them toothless. That in turn enabled Hussein to continue his brutal reign and cost untold thousands of Iraqis their lives. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The quest for nukes <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Intelligence agencies warned the Clinton and Bush administrations that Hussein was reconstituting his once-impressive program to create nuclear weapons. In part that intel reflected embarrassment over U.S. failure before the Persian Gulf war to grasp how close Iraq was to building nukes. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Four intel studies from 1997-2000 concurred that &quot;If Iraq acquired a significant quantity of fissile material through foreign assistance, it could have a crude nuclear weapon within a year.&quot; Claims that Iraq sought uranium and special tubes for processing nuclear material appear discredited. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; If the White House manipulated or exaggerated the nuclear intelligence before the war in order to paint a more menacing portrait of Hussein, it&#39;s difficult to imagine why. For five years, the official and oft-delivered alarms from the U.S. intelligence community had been menacing enough. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Hussein&#39;s rope-a-dope <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The longer Hussein refuses to obey UN directives to disclose his weapons programs, the greater the risk that he will acquire, or share with terrorists, the weaponry he has used in the past or the even deadlier capabilities his scientists have tried to develop. Thus we need to wage a pre-emptive war. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Hussein didn&#39;t have illicit weapons stockpiles to wield or hand to terrorists. Subsequent investigations have concluded he had the means and intent to rekindle those programs as soon as he escaped UN sanctions. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Had Hussein not been deposed, would he have reconstituted deadly weaponry or shared it with terror groups? Of the White House&#39;s nine arguments for war, the implications of this warning about Iraq&#39;s intentions are treacherous to imagine--yet also the least possible to declare true or false. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Waging war on terror <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraq was Afghanistan&#39;s likely successor as a haven for terror groups. &quot;Saddam Hussein is harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror ... &quot; the president said. &quot;And he cannot be trusted. The risk is simply too great that he will use them, or provide them to a terror network.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The White House echoed four years of intel that said Hussein contemplated the use of terror against the U.S. or its allies. But he evidently had not done so on a broad scale. The assertion that Hussein was &quot;harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror&quot; overstated what we know today. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The drumbeat of White House warnings before the war made Iraq&#39;s terror activities sound more ambitious than subsequent evidence has proven. Based on what we know today, the argument that Hussein was able to foment global terror against this country and its interests was exaggerated. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Reform in the Middle East <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Supplanting Hussein&#39;s reign with self-rule would transform governance in a region dominated by dictators, zealots and kings. The administration wanted to convert populations of subjects into citizens. Mideast democracy would channel energy away from resentments that breed terrorism. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; U.S. pressure has stirred reforms in Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and imperiled Syria&#39;s regime. &quot;I was cynical about Iraq,&quot; said Druze Muslim patriarch Walid Jumblatt. &quot;But when I saw the Iraqi people voting . . . it was the start of a new Arab world... The Berlin Wall has fallen.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The notion that invading Iraq would provoke political tremors in a region long ruled by despots is the Bush administration&#39;s most successful prewar prediction to date. A more muscular U.S. diplomacy has advanced democracy and assisted freedom movements in the sclerotic Middle East. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraq and Al Qaeda <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; President Bush: &quot;... Iraq and the Al Qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy--the United States of America. We know that Iraq and Al Qaeda have had high-level contacts that go back a decade.... Iraq has trained Al Qaeda members in bombmaking and poisons and deadly gases.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Two government investigative reports indicate that Al Qaeda and Iraq had long-running if sporadic contacts. Several of the prewar intel conclusions likely are true. But the high-ranking Al Qaeda detainee who said Iraq trained Al Qaeda in bombmaking, poisons and gases later recanted. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; No compelling evidence ties Iraq to Sept. 11, 2001, as the White House implied. Nor is there proof linking Al Qaeda in a significant way to the final years of Hussein&#39;s regime. By stripping its rhetoric of the ambiguity present in the intel data, the White House exaggerated this argument for war. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The Butcher of Baghdad <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell: &quot;For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows--intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Human Rights Watch estimates that Hussein exterminated 300,000 people. Chemical weapons killed Iraqi Kurds and Iranians; Iraqi Shiites also were slaughtered. Tortures included amputation, rape, piercing hands with drills, burning some victims alive and lowering others into acid baths. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; In detailing how Hussein tormented his people--and thus mocked the UN Security Council order that he stop--the White House assessments were accurate. Few if any war opponents have challenged this argument, or suggested that an unmolested Hussein would have eased his repression. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Iraqis liberated <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE SAID <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; President Bush and his surrogates broached a peculiar notion: that the Arab world was ready to embrace representative government. History said otherwise--and it wasn&#39;t as if the Arab street was clamoring for Iraq to show the way. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; WHAT WE KNOW TODAY <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The most succinct evaluation comes from Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.): &quot;Every time the 27 million Iraqis have been given the chance since Saddam Hussein was overthrown, they have voted for self-government and hope over the violence and hatred the 10,000 terrorists offer them.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; THE VERDICT <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The White House was correct in predicting that long subjugated Iraqis would embrace democracy. And while Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites have major differences to reconcile, a year&#39;s worth of predictions that Sunni disaffection could doom self-rule have, so far, proven wrong.</p>

	<p>The White House urged a timid UN to enforce its demands that Saddam Hussein stop mistreating his people. Part 8 in a Tribune series exploring the administration&#39;s arguments for war.<br/>What White House contended <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; America, like the rest of the world, has an inconsistent record of confronting, or tolerating, mass murder. For many years, Iraq was New Rwanda, a slaughterhouse ignored by a United Nations content to mouth its humanitarian platitudes.In making its case for war, the Bush administration did not argue primarily that the U.S. had the moral duty to purge a tyrant. Rather, the White House urged that the timid UN, arguably corrupted by oil-for-food bribes, enforce its demands that Saddam Hussein end his butchery. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Speaking at the UN on Sept. 12, 2002, President Bush told the diplomats: &quot;In 1991, Security Council Resolution 688 demanded that the Iraqi regime cease at once the repression of its own people, including the systematic repression of minorities, which the council said threatened international peace and security in the region. This demand goes ignored.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; That accurately described Resolution 688, which condemned repression &quot;in many parts of Iraq, including most recently in Kurdish populated areas. ... &quot; The mandate called for that cruelty to end and urged respect for &quot;the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Bush then gave the diplomats a chilling litany of specifics: &quot;Last year the UN Commission on Human Rights found that Iraq continues to commit extremely grave violations of human rights and that the regime&#39;s repression is all-pervasive. Tens of thousands of political opponents and ordinary citizens have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, summary execution and torture by beating and burning, electric shock, starvation, mutilation and rape. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;Wives are tortured in front of their husbands, children in the presence of their parents, and all of these horrors concealed from the world by the apparatus of a totalitarian state.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; During his Oct. 7, 2002, speech in Cincinnati, Bush added more details that portrayed the dictator as nihilist and macabre: &quot;On Saddam Hussein&#39;s orders, opponents have been decapitated, wives and mothers of political opponents have been systematically raped as a method of intimidation, and political prisoners have been forced to watch their own children being tortured. ... &quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Then-Secretary of State Colin Powell reminded the UN Security Council on Feb. 5, 2003, of how Hussein&#39;s weaponry had vanquished innocents: &quot;... Saddam Hussein&#39;s use of mustard and nerve gas against the Kurds in 1988 was one of the 20th Century&#39;s most horrible atrocities. Five thousand men, women and children died. His campaign against the Kurds from 1987 to &#39;89 included mass summary executions, disappearances, arbitrary jailing, ethnic cleansing and the destruction of some 2,000 villages. He has also conducted ethnic cleansing against the Shi&#39;a Iraqis and the Marsh Arabs, whose culture has flourished for more than a millennium. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;Saddam Hussein&#39;s police state ruthlessly eliminates anyone who dares to dissent. Iraq has more forced disappearance cases than any other country--tens of thousands of people reported missing in the past decade. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;Nothing points more clearly to Saddam Hussein&#39;s dangerous intentions and the threat he poses to all of us than his calculated cruelty to his own citizens and to his neighbors. ... <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;For more than 20 years, by word and by deed, Saddam Hussein has pursued his ambition to dominate Iraq and the broader Middle East using the only means he knows--intimidation, coercion and annihilation of all those who might stand in his way. For Saddam Hussein, possession of the world&#39;s most deadly weapons is the ultimate trump card, the one he must hold to fulfill his ambition.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; What we know today <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The butchery of Saddam Hussein&#39;s Iraq was remote from the American experience--psychopathic in design, unfathomable in scope. What are our ears to make of 38-year-old Ahmed Hassan Mohammed, testifying Dec. 5 at Hussein&#39;s trial in Baghdad about the blood and shreds of hair beneath what he described as a human meat grinder? <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Isolated grotesquerie, that we can fathom. We can wrap our imaginations, abhorrently, around a John Wayne Gacy with corpses tidily arrayed like parquet tiles beneath his suburban home. How, though, do we grasp the ambition of the pogroms Hussein orchestrated? How, too, do we grasp a timid world&#39;s eagerness to avert its eyes? <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; No one knows how many people Hussein&#39;s regime exterminated. Probably the most authoritative estimates come from Human Rights Watch, a New York-based organization. The group estimates a toll of 300,000--a number sufficiently conservative to withstand challenge. Other estimates run much higher. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; In December 2002, three months before war in Iraq, Human Rights Watch enumerated Hussein&#39;s cruelties in a policy paper titled &quot;Justice for Iraq.&quot; Among its assertions: <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - &quot;Iraq used chemical weapons extensively, starting in 1983-1984, during the Iran-Iraq war. It is estimated that some 20,000 Iranians were killed by mustard gas, and the nerve agents tabun and sarin.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - &quot;The government&#39;s notorious attacks on the Iraqi Kurds have come in phases. Between 1977 and 1987, some 4,500-5,000 Kurdish villages were systematically destroyed and their inhabitants forcibly removed and made to live in `resettlement camps.&#39; Commencing in the spring of 1987, thousands of Iraqi Kurds were killed during chemical and conventional bombardments. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;From February to September 1988, the Iraqi government launched the official `Anfal&#39; campaign, during which Iraqi troops swept through the highlands of Iraqi Kurdistan rounding up everyone who remained in government-declared `prohibited zones.&#39; More than 100,000 Kurds, mostly men and boys, were trucked to remote sites and executed. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; &quot;The use of chemical weapons reached a peak in March 1988; in the town of Halabja alone, where a documented 3,200 people are believed to have died from chemical gas attacks, and the actual number may be more than 5,000.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - &quot;During the early years of the [1980-88] Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi government arrested thousands of Shi&#39;a Muslims [for alleged Iranian sympathies]. Many have `disappeared&#39; or remain unaccounted for; others died under torture or were executed. This campaign was followed by the forced expulsion of over half a million Shi&#39;a during the 1980s to Iran, after the separation out of many male family members. These men and boys, estimated to number between 50,000-70,000, were arrested and imprisoned indefinitely without charge; most remain unaccounted for.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - &quot;After the Gulf War, in southern Iraq, members of the Shi&#39;a majority rose up in revolt against the Iraqi leadership. In response, thousands of Shi&#39;a including hundreds of clerics and their students, were imprisoned without charge or `disappeared&#39; in state custody. Hundreds were summarily executed.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - The total number of Iraqi &quot;disappearances&quot; reached 250,000 to 290,000, including members of &quot;communist and other leftist groups; Kurdish, Assyrian and Turcoman opposition groups; out-of-favor Ba&#39;athists; and the relatives of persons in these groups.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - A &quot;ubiquitous network of security services and informants has suppressed independent civilian institutions and terrorized the Iraqi population into virtual silence. Torture techniques have included hangings, beatings, rape and burning suspects alive. Thousands of Iraqi political detainees have died under torture.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A parallel U.S. State Department report to Congress for 2002 chronicled other practices of Hussein&#39;s regime: amputation without anaesthesia, burning with hot irons and blowtorches, suspension from rotating ceiling fans and, beginning in 2000, tongue amputation--in front of crowds--for critics of the dictator or his family. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; A November 2002 British government dossier listed other torture techniques, such as piercing hands with electric drills, gouging out the eyes of some victims and gradually lowering others into acid baths. The British also cited Iraqi efforts to &quot;cleanse&quot; prisons: &quot;In 1984, 4,000 political prisoners were executed at a single prison, the Abu Ghraib.&quot; <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Since the invasion of Iraq, the discovery of some 300 sites where Hussein&#39;s henchmen buried their victims has refreshed the agony of Iraqi families unable to find even fragments of their loved ones&#39; remains. Evidence at Hussein&#39;s trial, and the discovery of secret government files by the tons, may help a nation comprehend the breadth of its suffering. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; - - - <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; The risk in considering body counts this large, cruelties this ghoulish, is that at some point the victims seem more like statistics than individual men, or women, or children. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; In detailing how Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime had mistreated his people--and mocked United Nations Security Council Resolution 688--the Bush White House was spot-on, even reserved. Few if any war opponents, in this country or elsewhere, have suggested that the administration exaggerated this argument. <br/>&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; Nor have the opponents asserted that an unmolested Hussein would, out of gratitude, have eased his repression. Those UN inspectors who, for a time, supposedly contained his menace? Their specialty was searching for weapons sites, not exhuming mass graves.</p>
