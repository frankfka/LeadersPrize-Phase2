<h3>McCain Shifts Position on More US Troops to Afghanistan</h3>
<p class="date">July 15, 2008  5:20 PM</p>
<!-- <p class="author">Natalie Gewargis</p>-->
<p>While <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/07/the-success-of.html "><strong>Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, was seeming defensive on Iraq today</strong></a>, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was changing his position on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Just last week, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/07/09/politics/fromtheroad/entry4246617.shtml"><strong>McCain was calling for the U.S.'s NATO allies to increase their troop presence in Afghanistan</strong></a>  and was resisting calls for more U.S. troops there. “I would like to have our allies make a bigger commitment, both in personnel and other ways,” McCain said in Portsmouth, Ohio. “I’d like to hear from our military leaders, our chairman of the joint chiefs, as well as the military commanders there.” </p>
<p>McCain foreign policy aide Randy Scheunemann told <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/07/06/obama_mccain_split_over_afghan_strategy/?page=2"><strong>the Boston Globe</strong></a>  that there needed to be more NATO troops, and "there is no easy answer, but clearly Pakistan needs to do more to crack down there."</p>
<p>This was quite a contrast from Obama, who <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://www.nysun.com/national/mccain-will-call-for-a-surge-of-troops/81861/ "><strong>since August 2007</strong></a> has been calling for at least two additional U.S. brigades in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>A contrast, that is…until today.</p>
<p>"Our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan say that they need at least three additional brigades," <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2008/07/mccain-now-supp.html"><strong>McCain said today</strong></a>  at a town hall in Albuquerque. "Thanks to the success of the surge, these forces are becoming available, and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them."</p>
<p>During a trip to Afghanistan in 2006, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/16/asia/AS_GEN_Afghan_US.php "><strong>McCain resisted such a call</strong></a>, saying when asked if more US troops were needed, "If it's necessary, we will, and I'm sure we would be agreeable, but the focus here is more on training the Afghan National Army and the police, as opposed to the increased U.S. troop presence."</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters on his bus today after his speech, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/15/mccain_revises_plan_to_send_th.html "><strong>McCain rejected the notion</strong></a> that he and Obama have similar plans for the region.</p>
<p>"He's just said we need more troops," McCain said. "There is a dramatic difference. He's never been to Afghanistan, he's never been briefed on Afghanistan personally by the commanders." Moreover, McCain asserted, Obama doesn't see the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as connected, as does McCain.</p>
<p>"If we fail in Iraq, it would have meant enormous encouragement to the Taliban in Afghanistan and other anti-American elements and jihadists throughout the region," McCain said. "And so to say, we could have let Iraq fail, as Senator Obama said,...that would have had a devastating effect in my view on our reliability in the region, that the willingness of our allies to cooperate with us in Afghanistan, and so they are connected. In life and warfare, failure breeds failure, success breeds success. That is just a lesson of history, and Senator Obama obviously does not understand those lessons."</p>
<p>McCain also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080918155309/http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/07/mccain-campaign.html"><strong>repeated a charge first made by Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-NY</strong></a>,  against Obama -- that he chairs a Foreign Affairs subcommittee with oversight over NATO operations and yet "he's never had a hearing. He's never had a hearing. So I am not surprised that all he has done is said, 'Well, we need more troops.'" </p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joe Biden, D-Del, rejected that accusation in a statement to ABC News. "The reason Senator Obama didn’t chair a NATO and Afghanistan subcommittee hearing is because I did, as Chairman of the Committee….when it comes to the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, we hold those hearings at the full committee level,” he said.</p>

<span class="comments"><p>The only "connection" between Iraq and Afghanistan is the total incompetence by the Bush Regime, including Juan McCain, in running both Wars.  Iraq has nothing to do with 9/11 or any so called War on Terror. It was supposedly a War of Liberation and to enforce UN Resolutions regarding WMD's,  foreign fighters showed up there as Al Qaeda in Iraq because the U.S. Military was there, the insurgents there have every right to fight against any foreign occupation of their country, they are not Terrorists.</p>
<p>Bush keeps saying that's it's better to fight them "over there" instead of here, but does he believe he's punishing Al Qaeda by making their trainees travel to Iraq, while Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda an Talaban leaders have been practically ignored since Bush abandoned his War on Terror for a War For Oil.</p>
<p>It really doesn't matter what either Juan or Barrack plan for Iraq now, the Iraqi's themselves are ready to kick us out and then move forward with becoming a new Iranian State. Hundreds of Billions of U.S. Taxpayer dollars, borrowed from China, and more than 4000 American lives, all spent in aiding Iran.</p></span>

<span class="comments"><p>The major difference between these two on foreign policy are the advisers.  While Senator Obama has assembled a team of top notch foreign policy experts with varied backgrounds and affiliations and tends to take their advice into consideration before making a policy statement or a "shift" in policy, as time dictates needed changes; McCain on the other hand, has relied heavily on former Bush advisers, or individuals such as Charlie Black, the lobbyist who has been shuffled from the forefront after stating that "another attack on America would help McCain" and individuals such as former CIA head, James Woolsey, who advised McCain to "bomb Syria". In this respect, McCain's change, (shift, flip-flop, whatever term one wishes to apply), acknowledges the advantage and superiority Senator Obama has over that of his own team. McCain has consistently demonstrated his lack of ability to choose credible individuals for advice, as has been exhibited by the almost weekly exit of the same individuals from his team. This fact has just been reinforced by the exit of his top economic adviser, Phil Gramm.  This should be a red flag for anyone.</p></span>

<span class="comments"><p>dl made at comment at 8:40 that made a lot of sense. It is worth reading and thinking about.<br/>
As for the topic of this article, McCain is following Obama on sending more troops to Afghanistan. Obama has been saying more troops were needed there for many months. The troops themselves have been saying the same thing in many news articles that they feel forgotten, that their numbers are too few, leaving them open to attack in many situations and unable to make progress. <br/>
What McCain doesn't seem to understand is that is doesn't take prior military experience to lead an army. It takes someone that is intelligent and willing to listen to the troops, the generals, and good old common sense. Obama has proved over and over he has the ability to make the right calls. </p></span>

The Iraqis want a timetable (JSM III doesn't), the war commanders want to re-focus on Afghanistan (JSM III just now gets it) and the US and others are talking more to Iran (JSM III just wants to bomb them or kill them with lung cancer). Let's not even mention that John Sydney McCain III keeps referring to a country that hasn't existed for 15 years. Man is this guy serious or what?</p></span>

Obviously he is not the brightest bulb on the tree.  He was shot down by an out-of-date Soviet missile by men with no experience in anti-aircraft warfare because he did not follow the rules of evasion taught at the Academy.  Let's just say the man has only one oar in the water. </p>
<p>He disses two in five people on the face of the earth by referring to all Asians as “Gooks.” He may be viewed as a “hero,” but I don’t think being shot down qualifies him for the job of president.<br/>

<span class="comments"><p>Wisdom   You have the wisdom of a republican Rush Limbaugh listener. Obama said when having conversations with immigrant communities in the wake of 9/11 his meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans, have been of an urgent quality. They have stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging. They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly. Therefore he has reassured them that he will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction. This simply means he would not allow our government to mistreat these Americans any more than he would allow any other group or type of people to be persecuted by our government. Obama is a man to be admired for standing up for us all.</p></span>

This election is about Judgment. Repeatedly, Obama is showing significantly better judgment on issues than McCain. This most recent flip-flop of McCain's is just one more in a long line of 'shifts'. The last thing we need is a POTUS that continues the experience we've seen the past 7 years. More of the same isn't good enough.</p></span>

<span class="comments"><p>Obama has been talking about Afghanistan for months now. McCain has been calling him 'naive' and 'inexperienced' for this stance. <br/>
As recent as last April, McCain said Afghanistan poses no problem. All of a sudden, McFlipFlop now embraces Obama's policy on Afghanistan. <br/>
This is even more than just a flip-flop for McBush. It shows he is out of touch on foreign policy, inconsistent in his views, or at least lacking in short term memory.<br/>
This shift would suggest that Obama has the better handle on foreign policy, terrorism, and international relationships than does McCain. But, wasn't foreign policy supposed to be McCain's strong suit?</p></span>

<p>Maybe if McCain could read a teleprompter, he would realize Obama has been arguing this since McCain authorized the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>Obama called it a major mistake to not focus on Afghanistan and the head of Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>This is the most disgusting flip flop I've ever seen.  McCain should have a "I love to flip flop tattoo" on his forehead.</p></span>

<p>Somebody has to tell the truth about John McCain. John is incompetent when it comes to military and international affairs.</p>
<p>Sunni are a distinct group from Shia. Iran is Shia. Al Qaeda is Sunni. There is no country called Czechoslovakia. There was no “Al Qaeda in Iraq” until the Iraq war. And the Sunni's started forming anti-Al Qaeda 'awakening councils' BEFORE the surge.</p>
<p>Most importantly, while the Republican economists like Phil Gramm were sleeping, an economic giant has risen that will soon have a larger middle class, more engineers and scientists, and LARGER GDP THAN THE UNITED STATES, has risen.</p>
<p>In the twenty years it will take for off-shore oil production to go online, China's thirst for oil will have grown fifteen times the production capability of these fields. Tell me again how this is going to lower the world price of oil?</p>
<p>John McCain is right about one thing: he really doesn't know very much about economics. Except for what Phil Gramm has told him!  <br/>

Republicans have been blindly following Bush while he made sure he screwed up as much as possible. Obama will do nothing blindly, his decisions and actions will be careful and thorough.

<p>You of course realize that the term 'flip-flop' was invented by your party, right? We're just giving you a taste of your own medicine. Only this time, McCain has *actually* changed positions (not just changing them for good reason, mind you, but often denies that he has ever done anything different). Whereas Kerry was labeled so due to a carelessly-worded statement.</p>
<p>See, Democrats (or most anyway), would never have come up with such a shallow, politically-resonant term to derail someone--that's what Karl Rove was so good at. We're just retaliating. Feels good, doesn't it?</p></span>

I didnt see a huge change in mccains opinion for Afghanistan he said before if we need to add more troops we will and now he is saying we need  more troops the thought is did we always need more troops and he just didnt see this need or did this need just come about?<br/>
  "In life and warfare, failure breeds failure, success breeds success."<br/>
  if he believes this he has already admitted that we have failed. The iraq war was not needed and brought more problems and death than was before and for what? i have yet to have a straight answer as to why we are even in iraq?!! <br/>
 i would call that a HUGE failure! I think the level of respect and trust we have from other countries vs 8 or 10 years ago is a problem because of failures and our refusal to admit them.  but i dont agree that because you fail at one thing that you are doomed to always fail.  </p></span>

Katrina was setup by placing many people in poverty in a vulnerable city. I cannot believe the Democrats could have done a better job. Have you heard of the Great Depression?

<span class="comments"><p>I agree with McFish (like a fish out of water he flips and flops all over the place) in that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are connected.  Invasion of Iraq let the Taliban regain strength in Afghanistan and Pakistan--leading us to perhaps lose the real reason for being at war there.</p>
<p>Additionally, Iran is a problem because the US war in Iraq has more than anything else elevated Iran's power in the region.</p></span>

<p>I do not blame McCain for changing his position on Afghanistan.  It is much better to correct a mistake than  stubbornly refuse to do so lest someone lables you a flip-flopper.</p>
<p>What greatly concerns me, however, is McCain's failure to grasp this earlier. </p>
<p>Frankly, I do not regard Obama as a military genius on getting this point right away, as it was pretty obvious.  But I do believe McCain's long delay in cognition reveals a lack of even  minimal competence to correctly assess and deal with pretty straightforward military issues.</p></span>

HEY Topher | Jul 15, 2008 6:29:34 PM;</p>
<p>Don't you find it a tad scarey that Obama  "chairs a Foreign Affairs subcommittee with oversight over NATO operations and yet "he's never had a hearing. He's never had a hearing."</p>
<p>I think I would rather take McCain's view then, when he says: "So I am not surprised that all he has done is said, 'Well, we need more troops.'" </p>

<span class="comments"><p>In either case (Iraq or Afghanistan) we have been fighting the wrong war for 7 years. Osama has been literally missing for those 7 years which means if he were any other person on the planet, he would be considered legally dead by statute by now. Instead of accepting this as we would with any other person who has been missing for this long, we feel it necessary to ratchet up the military presence in a war that has no more real definition to what would qualify it as a success any more than we have for Iraq.<br/>
Give up the ghost. The largest, most technologically advance nation and military in history has not so much as reported spotting this guy in 7 years. Do we really have to wage an unending war in some middle eastern equivalent of the 1930's dust bowl for 7 more years to justify our sense of vengeance and the failure of our leadership to apprehend a man who has succefully alluded the United States president's promise of his dead or alive capture?? No.</p></span>

<p>It's almost as if you folks wouldn't be happy unless McCain wanted to apply exactly the same military strategy to both countries now as would have been appropriate in 2006.</p>
<p>You want to talk flip-floppery?  Obama railed against the surge all of 2007.  He said it would make things worse.  He called it a failure.  Now all his anti-surge talk has been scrubbed from his website and his team is pretending that they always thought more troops would fix the security problem.</p>
<p>FYI, I'm voting 3rd party, so I'm no McCain shill.  But to accuse McCain of flip-flopping on the wars is sheer idiocy.</p></span>

McCain is no more (or less) of a "flip flopper" than any one. The problem with McCain in this instance is, he is urging success in Iraq, when no one has qualified what success might be regarding Iraq. In this way he is guilty of blowing smoke and just mimicking the Bush administration's ability to say what they like whether it's true or not and make it up as they go along regardless of the fact that they lost sight of the reality of the situation, long ago.   </p></span>

<p>We can't even afford the war on Iraq. McCain is so wrong on this issue it's ridiculous. Should we count on a draft from a McCain presidency?</p></span>

No suprise here, sounds like he is going to do the surge agin, this time in Afganistan. I guess Obama has learned his lesson on opposing surges.</p></span>

<p>The media ragged on Obama for his "refine" Iraq policy as being a flip flopper.  Why can't the media call McCain a FLIP FLOPPER for totally CHANGING his Afghanistan policy.</p>
<p>You can see there is a disparity between how the media treats Obama vs McCain.</p>
<p>McCain is the flip flopper on his Afghanistan approach and NO ONE IS CALLING HIM ON IT.</p></span>
