When choosing one for your kitchen, the main features to consider are the dispenser's material and design.</p><p>Typically, the most common materials are stainless steel, glass, or plastic, but the right choice comes down to what best suits your lifestyle. For example, stainless steel is super durable, easy to clean, and won't rust or corrode. However, it tends to be more expensive and<strong> </strong>may not fit your interior design aesthetic. Glass, on the other hand, is timeless and suitable for any kitchen, but it's easy to break if you're not careful. And plastic is more budget-friendly, though it won't be as sturdy or feel as refined as other options. </p><p>The design itself is also essential to consider before purchasing your dispenser. A simple standard pump is quick-to-use and won't need much maintenance. More specialty options, like automatic, foaming, or built-in sink dispensers, require a little more maintenance, like batteries, special soap, or installation. </p><p>Automatic soap dispensers are a no-touch option that's especially great for the kitchen, where you may be handling raw meats and other contaminants. Meanwhile, foaming dispensers are great for those who want to save more on liquid soap by decreasing the amount used per pump. And, if you're interested in a built-in sink dispenser, make sure your sink is able to accommodate it, or that the dispenser is compatible with all sinks (like one of my picks below). Some dispensers can also be wall-mounted to keep your countertop clutter-free.</p><p>With all this in mind, read on to find the <a class="jk" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-6-best-soap-dispensers-18210215">best soap dispenser</a> for your kitchen.</p><div class="jq"><h3 class="jr">1.
