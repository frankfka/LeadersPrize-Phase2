This will almost certainly shift the court to the right, and creates the very real possibility that the <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a21964997/naral-ilyse-hogue-roe-v-wade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supreme Court will overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em></a><em> </em>at some point in the future. But what would it mean if this happened?</p><p>Court observers are bullish on the odds of the Supreme Court banning abortion once Trump's appointment, whomever it is, gets confirmed by the Senate. The <em>New Yorker</em>'s <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin/status/1012034512312832001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffrey Toobin predicted Wednesday that</a> &quot;abortion will be illegal in twenty states in 18 months,&quot; while Vox's <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanmatt/status/1012036434491068423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan Matthews pegged the odds</a> of such an outcome at 70-80 percent.</p><p><em>Roe v. Wade</em>, of course, <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/781636/does-justice-anthony-kennedys-retirement-spell-end-roe-v-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was the landmark 1973 SCOTUS decision</a> that granted American women the constitutional right to abortion. Although many states have passed laws <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">limiting access to abortion</a>, <em>Roe </em>makes it illegal for states or localities to outright ban the procedure. During his presidential campaign, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2017/live-updates/trump-white-house/neil-gorsuch-confirmation-hearings-updates-and-analysis-on-the-supreme-court-nominee/trump-promised-judges-who-would-overturn-roe-v-wade/?utm_term=.78c56cb2d655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump said that he would appoint anti-abortion</a> judges who would overturn <em>Roe</em>. With Kennedy retiring, the court may soon have the votes to do this. </p><p>&quot;Anti-abortion groups are explicitly saying this seat is the moment to overturn <em>Roe</em>,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/PPact/status/1012049475181924353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planned Parenthood tweeted after Kennedy announced</a> his retirement. &quot;THIS is what's at stake.&quot;</p><div class="fS"><div class="nV"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/ReproRights/status/1012044011857735682"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>There are infinite ways the court could go about repealing <em>Roe</em>, as it would depend largely on the judicial challenge that leads the court to reconsider the ruling. Such a ruling could take many forms, and it's impossible to say exactly what it would look like. The overturning of <em>Roe</em> wouldn't result in abortion immediately becoming illegal nationwide; however, it would allow states to pass laws that completely ban abortion.</p><p>Some states won't have to: Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota have already passed <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">laws that automatically ban abortion</a> if <em>Roe</em> is overturned. </p><p>Likewise, there are ten states that still have pre-<em>Roe</em> laws on the books banning abortion. Those laws are currently unenforced because of <em>Roe</em>, but they'll become the law of the land if the court strikes <em>Roe</em> down. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin.   </p><p>On the flip side, eight states have laws on the books that protect a woman's right to abortion even if <em>Roe </em>does get struck down.<em> </em>Women in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, and Washington will have the right to abortion regardless what happens to <em>Roe</em>, thanks to state laws.  </p><div class="fS"><div class="nV"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/theglipper/status/1012057486403211264"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/theglipper/status/1012057486403211264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Amendment lawyer Greg Lipper</a> points out, it's also possible that a Kennedy-less Supreme Court could allow states to effectively ban abortion without actually overturning <em>Roe</em>. Some states have passed laws that, while not literally banning abortion, make the procedure extraordinarily difficult, and in some cases impossible, to access. Iowa, for instance, recently passed a bill that <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/iowa-abortion-restrictions-ca627ba72c1e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bans abortion after six weeks</a> — before most women even know that they're pregnant. </p><p>Anti-abortion lawmakers often pass laws like this not only to limit women's access to abortions within their states, but also in hopes that they'll end up before the Supreme Court and hopefully chip away<em> </em>at <em>Roe</em>'s protections. It's possible that a court with Trump's next appointee could uphold a law like Iowa's by ruling that it doesn't violate <em>Roe, </em>which would allow states to effectively outlaw abortion despite <em>Roe</em> technically still being the law of the land. In other words, the court could keep <em>Roe</em> but render it toothless.</p><p>There is a chance, albeit a slim one, that Trump won't be able to get an anti-<em>Roe</em> judge confirmed. Republican Sen. Susan Collins — whose vote may be be necessary to confirm the next justice, assuming every Democrat votes against them — said Wednesday that she believes <em>Roe</em> is &quot;settled law,&quot; raising the possibility that she could vote against an anti-<em>Roe</em> appointee.</p><p>&quot;I view Roe v. Wade as being settled law,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/npfandos/status/1012067714330955777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collins told a <em>New York Times</em> reporter</a> after Kennedy's retirement. &quot;It’s clearly precedent and I always look for judges who respect precedent.&quot;</p><h2>Read more on Kennedy's retirement:</h2><p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-trump-nominate-a-new-supreme-court-justice-potus-is-eager-to-replace-anthony-kennedy-9607401">This Is How Soon Trump Could Pick Justice Anthony Kennedy's Replacement</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/who-will-replace-anthony-kennedy-trump-will-get-to-pick-his-second-scotus-justice-9606669">This Is Who Trump Might Have His Eye On To Be The Next Supreme Court Justice</a></p><p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-ruth-bader-ginsburg-retire-soon-anthony-kennedys-announcement-is-making-people-worry-9609316">Why People Are So Worried About Ruth Bader Ginsburg Retiring Now</a></p></div></div></article></div><div class="I"><input id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox" class="L" /><label for="navCheckbox" class="J"></label><nav class="K"><label for="navCheckbox" class="X"><span></span></label><div class="M"><i class="N"></i></div><div class="O"><a href="/news" class="P">News</a><a href="/entertainment" class="P">Entertainment</a><a href="/beauty" class="P">Beauty</a><a href="/fashion" class="P">Fashion</a><a href="/lifestyle" class="P">Lifestyle</a><a href="/flowcharts" class="P">Flowcharts</a><a href="/books" class="P">Books</a><a href="/tech" class="P">Tech</a><a href="/food" class="P">Food</a><a href="/wellness" class="P">Wellness</a><a href="/features" class="P">Features</a></div><div class="Q"><a href="https://bustle.company/" class="R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About Us</a><a href="https://bustle.company/advertise" class="R">Advertise</a><a href="/apps" class="R">Apps</a><a href="/labs" class="R">Labs</a><a href="/tos" class="R">Terms</a><a href="/privacy" class="R">Privacy</a><a href="/dmca" class="R">DMCA</a><a href="/contact" class="R">Contact Us</a></div><div class="S fE"><a class="T" href="https://www.facebook.com/bustledotcom/" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fy"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://twitter.com/bustle" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fz"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://www.pinterest.com/bustledotcom/" title="Pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fA"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://www.instagram.com/bustle/" title="Instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fB"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/bustle/id1019829583?mt=2" title="Podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fC"></i></a></div><div class="V"><span class="W">®</span> 2018 Bustle</div></nav></div><noscript><img src="https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif" /><img src="https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&amp;c2=17519299&amp;cs_ucfr=0&amp;cv=2.0&amp;cj=1" /><img src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1" /></noscript></div> <script>

Some states have passed laws that, while not literally banning abortion, make the procedure extraordinarily difficult, and in some cases impossible, to access.
