|SEP| 0.5163387060165405: I think we should say that.. 
|SEP| 0.5161898136138916: We have more questions 
|SEP| 0.5155254006385803: I do 
|SEP| 0.515404999256134: what is your take on this

|SEP| 0.5142326951026917: I think they will pass that ultimately 
|SEP| 0.5142326951026917: I think they will pass that ultimately 
|SEP| 0.5138197541236877: Well some people might think that had some influence

|SEP| 0.5107260346412659: And they could have said that from the beginning 
|SEP| 0.5104002952575684: ROBERTS Let me ask you this ... 
|SEP| 0.5096834301948547: And as I said then that it -- it needs happen

|SEP| 0.5095039010047913: TODD Thank you both 
|SEP| 0.5092945098876953: And I think that is the problem ... 
|SEP| 0.5092515349388123: Others are questioning that 
|SEP| 0.5089797377586365: And that is it for us today 
|SEP| 0.5089577436447144: SANDERS But if the ... 
|SEP| 0.5085992813110352: BAYH Well with ads like this it would be 
|SEP| 0.5079498291015625: let us get started 
|SEP| 0.5075291395187378: That suddenly made things look a little different 
|SEP| 0.5072734355926514: that is what I want do 
|SEP| 0.506744384765625: You have both been outspoken on that 
|SEP| 0.5063575506210327: What do you think they will -- how do you think that plays out 
|SEP| 0.5061951875686646: And why are they doing that 
|SEP| 0.5060911178588867: And you make it a little outlandish 
|SEP| 0.505882978439331: you are going have make choices 
|SEP| 0.5058352947235107: It will be resolved 
|SEP| 0.505614697933197: We will be right back 
|SEP| 0.5055217742919922: And let me repeat 
|SEP| 0.5037822127342224: Go ahead 
|SEP| 0.5036823749542236: SANDERS Let me agree 
|SEP| 0.5022518634796143: And you have got embrace the choice 
|SEP| 0.5017912983894348: that is what I intend do 
|SEP| 0.5013211965560913: So let me be very clear 
|SEP| 0.5011056065559387: I mean is that -- is that the way go 
|SEP| 0.5011056065559387: I mean is that -- is that the way go 
|SEP| 0.5010210871696472: ... you have still got do something first 
|SEP| 0.5003739595413208: Listen what I told them then 
|SEP| 0.5002708435058594: SANDERS Let me just say this 
|SEP| 0.4988427758216858: SENOR But the point is is that ... 
|SEP| 0.4988427758216858: SENOR But the point is is that ... 
|SEP| 0.4984031021595001: And I think we are making some progress 
|SEP| 0.49797728657722473: I mean 
|SEP| 0.4979321360588074: But obviously what is done is done 
|SEP| 0.49734973907470703: Who arranged that 
|SEP| 0.4973094165325165: And so that is what is going count 
|SEP| 0.4972135126590729: Something that would enable some kind of a settlement 
|SEP| 0.4970039129257202: Thanks for watching

|SEP| 0.6043536067008972: And when it comes primary and secondary education I pledge you we are going make sure all kids have good teachers in good schools no matter what zip code they live in 
|SEP| 0.5935978293418884: But there were also policy decisions regulatory changes providing more leeway the states so that they did not have either the requirement or the incentive continue lifting people particularly kids out of poverty 
|SEP| 0.5926973223686218: People should be able get the treatment that they need when they need it not two months from now which is why I believe in universal health 
|SEP| 0.5840741991996765: ALI you are my opposer when I want freedom you are my opposer when I want justice and you want me go somewhere and fight but you will not even stand up for me here at home 
|SEP| 0.5813083052635193: There is no challenge that is too great for us overcome provided we bring forward in these divided times new leadership that can heal our divides here at home and bring our principles into alignment abroad 
|SEP| 0.5788539052009583: And I did not quit until we got the childrens health insurance program that insures eight million kids 
|SEP| 0.577032744884491: But what the secretary neglected mention not just the twenty nine million still have no health insurance that even more are under insured with huge copayments and deductibles 
|SEP| 0.5769268870353699: Now flexibility can be good but you should not have worry that your family could lose your health care or retirement savings just because you change jobs or start a small business 
|SEP| 0.5754693746566772: And that is one of the programs that I was referring when I said after two thousand and one there were a lot of decisions made that basically did not carry on what had been not just the spirit but the requirements in the law because we had set the base payment at the highest possible rate and expected states do that 
|SEP| 0.5754472613334656: I think it is getting up every day building the relationships finding whatever sliver of common ground you can occupy never ever giving up in continuing reach out even people who are sworn political partisan adversaries 
|SEP| 0.573051393032074: So we do help subsidize individuals at private colleges or universities but we have never taken the position that there is no difference between the two of them 
|SEP| 0.5718156695365906: So rather than holding out the promise of free college which was not really free it was going be paid for by state and federal dollars I think it is important that we say we are going subsidize as far as we can responsibly go 
|SEP| 0.5709559917449951: nine million three hundred and seventy four thousand two hundred Well a as someone who as someone who has a a little bit of experience standing up the health insurance industry that CHEERING spent you know many many millions of dollars attacking me and probably will so again because of what I believe we can do building on the Affordable Care Act I think it is important point out that there are a lot of reasons we have the health care system we have today 
|SEP| 0.5704432129859924: So let us staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second none in the world and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child 
|SEP| 0.5694665312767029: And that means that means we need a president who knows what we are up against has no illusions about what we need do move ahead but can actually get it done 
|SEP| 0.5684848427772522: CLINTON And when you go get health care for your child nobody says Are you a Republican or a Democrat They say What does your child need 
|SEP| 0.5652642846107483: He said there is no mystery about what it takes build a strong and prosperous America Equality of opportunity Jobs for those who can work Security for those who need it The ending of special privilege for the few The preservation of civil liberties for all a wider and constantly rising standard of living 
|SEP| 0.5649680495262146: it is no secret that we are going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes advance a very different vision for America 
|SEP| 0.5643167495727539: But while we are looking at how we lift incomes which is the defining economic challenge that we have for working middle-class and poor families we need do much more provide the proven interventions in early childhood education that help families even poor families know more about how better prepare their kids 
|SEP| 0.5619750618934631: Now the argument that I have been making is Look part of the reason why Americans are agitated about immigration is because they do believe their jobs are being taken out from under them and there is an unlevel playing field because if you are employing undocumented workers and no one is holding you accountable which we have not we have not enforced those laws in a very comprehensive way then it is easy undercut the market 
|SEP| 0.5614720582962036: I do not know how we are going rebuild the trust because it really starts with saying `` Hey I made a mistake `` or `` I did not get it right `` or `` Hey I have got more information and let me tell you `` and just doing it in a very matter-of-fact way 
|SEP| 0.5614140033721924: Why did he care so much about children zero five besides that fact that he cared about them 
|SEP| 0.5607451796531677: And heres the important point we are spending far more per person on health care than the people of any other country 
|SEP| 0.5595270395278931: The fact that you will have complete rigid adherence that ideology which has failed again and again and again but nothing has changed nothing has been learned from experience 
|SEP| 0.5586008429527283: But heres the good news There are allies for change everywhere who know we can not stand by while inequality increases wages stagnate and the promise of America dims 
|SEP| 0.5581313967704773: That you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it without breaking the bank 
|SEP| 0.5580008625984192: six hundred and sixty thousand people walked out of the workforce last month not only with thirty eight thousand people got jobs but six hundred and sixty thousand said we are not looking for work anymore 
|SEP| 0.5579397678375244: there is a lot of behavioral science that if you attack someone endlessly even if none of what you say is true the very fact of attacking that person raises doubts and creates a negative perspective 
|SEP| 0.5573698282241821: And I do think and I keep saying this because I believe it I think the media environment where people are rewarded for being outrageous for yelling at each other for saying things that are untrue without being held accountable for it has contributed this attitude of divisiveness and separation 
|SEP| 0.5569455623626709: nine million three hundred and twenty four thousand six hundred But right now what we have deal with is the fact that twenty nine million people still have no health insurance 
|SEP| 0.5567041635513306: I walked door-to-door find out how many children with disabilities could not go school and help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access education 
|SEP| 0.5566092729568481: But it is hard for the average viewer or listener do that himself and there is no guide any longer 
|SEP| 0.5555486083030701: So it is not just a decision about whether or not increase the child tax credit or some other means of providing a greater financial safety net 
|SEP| 0.5544156432151794: I think there is a really great story that he tells about going back the town he grew up in outside of Cleveland where kids of all different backgrounds economic family standing and they are all together and everyone was in it together 
|SEP| 0.5533096194267273: In fact I think keeping the pressure on them helps us resolve the bigger problem and then we can look see what else if anything can and should be done 
|SEP| 0.5530176162719727: Our country will not be competitive or fair if we do not help more families give their kids the best possible start in life 
|SEP| 0.5527156591415405: But with women now the sole or primary breadwinner in a growing number of families there is more urgency than ever make it easier for Americans be good workers good parents and good caregivers all at the same time 
|SEP| 0.5524585843086243: So we can work toward a full employment and full potential economy and that does mean we can not ignore those who are still stuck on the sidelines or working part-time when what they really want is a full-time job 
|SEP| 0.5505896210670471: So I want go as high up the income scale as I can make sure that middle-class working and poor families do not have borrow money go college 
|SEP| 0.5503402352333069: And by the way as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control I believe that I am in an excellent position bring people together 
|SEP| 0.5499498844146729: That does not mean we should not have been looking at more ways lift more kids out of poverty 
|SEP| 0.5497602820396423: I think he has no idea how effective that would be or that the very next day Ryan would have say I am for Trump but I do not believe in what he is doing with that judge 
|SEP| 0.5496242046356201: So I think we have invest money create jobs for young people because right now I am worried that if young people do not get that first job when they are young learn about work understand the obligations as well as the promise of work it will be even more difficult get them into the work force later on 
|SEP| 0.5495333075523376: Tell me why we are spending over three times more than the British who guarantee health care all of their people 
|SEP| 0.5494037866592407: I think politicians look at the nonsense that people say running for office just ridiculous stuff and they get away with it because there is no big gong that rings `` my God look what so-and-so just said ``
