<hr/><h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<div style="float:right;margin:12px 5px 5px 15px;"><img alt="" class="imageshadow" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/Judge-Gavel.png" width="300"/></div>
<p>U.S. immigration enforcement and adjudication are failing. American immigration courts have the highest failure to appear rates of any courts in the country. Over the last 20 years, 37 percent of all aliens free pending trial failed to appear for their hearings. From the 2,498,375 foreign nationals outside detention during their court proceedings, 1,219,959 were ordered removed, 75 percent of them (918,098) for failing to appear. Only 25 percent of this group — some 301,861 people — actually litigated their claims. Trial courts are three times more likely to issue removal orders for failure to appear than removal orders based upon the merits of fully litigated claims. Nearly 46,000 people each year disappeared from court.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> Deportation orders for failure to appear are the largest group of orders issued by immigration courts outside detention facilities.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> From 1996 through 2015, removal orders for failure to appear numbered 918,098. Among those who absconded from court were 3,095 aliens from the 36 countries that promote terrorism. A disproportionate number — 338 altogether — came from those countries the U.S. State Department labels state sponsors of terrorism: Iran, Sudan, and Syria. As populations from countries that promote terrorism have increased since 9/11 — from naturalized citizens, immigrants,<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> and refugees<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a> — plots and acts of Islam-inspired terrorism have also increased, more than twice as many under Barack Obama than under George W. Bush. Unexecuted removal orders now number 953,506 — a 58 percent increase since 2002. An average of 25,107 unexecuted orders of removal were added each year through 2015.<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Practical reforms that serve America's age-old immigration world view — to attract the talented, redeem the persecuted, and remove the offender — are needed now, perhaps more than ever in our history, as a remedy for policies that have diminished the deserving, emboldened the suspect, and rewarded the violator.</p>
<p></p><center>
<hr/><p class="text-align-justify">It began with so much promise in 2008.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a> Assurances of secure borders and effective enforcement were send-ups for an immigration system badly needing both. One candidate, Barack Obama, seemed to get it. His campaign website quoted him:</p>
<p></p></center>
<blockquote><p>In approaching immigration reform, I believe that we must enact tough, practical reforms. ... We need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace. ... But for reform to work, we also must respond to what pulls people to America. ... The time to fix our broken immigration system is now.<a href="#7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A war-weary public, firmly rejecting bold immigration reforms proposed by George W. Bush only a year before, heard little to argue about or vote against.<a href="#8"><sup>8</sup></a> Obama spoke reasonably. His words invoked accountability for a system needing a strong dose of bottom-line sternness and he seemed to understand that for America's immigration system to work, it must sanction as well as redeem. He clearly declared that for a country to be secure, its borders must be sovereign.</p>
<p>But Mr. Obama promised one thing and delivered another across the gamut of immigration issues. Bad went to worse, and worse meant uncertainty for American workers,<a href="#9"><sup>9</sup></a> crime on American streets,<a href="#10"><sup>10</sup></a> unprecedented threats to national security,<a href="#11"><sup>11</sup></a> and, more importantly, a systemic brokenness advanced by the United States government itself.<a href="#12"><sup>12</sup></a> At the center of this brokenness is America's immigration courts. Sidelined by DHS (Department of Homeland Security) priorities that prosecuted few cases<a href="#13"><sup>13</sup></a> and deported even fewer offenders,<a href="#4"><sup>14</sup></a> courts became rubber stamps for enforcement that didn't enforce and prosecution that didn't prosecute. What removal orders they issued went unenforced by Homeland Security officials whose 18-year-old "Interior Enforcement Strategy" — the forerunner of the Obama administration's "smart enforcement" initiatives — never mentions immigration courts and removal orders.<a href="#15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Judges on immigration courts across the country were interviewed for this article. They spoke on background only, fearing their statements would prompt retaliation from superiors within the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency that manages the courts. They described a system plunged into turmoil by appointees at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security who ignored statutes, precedent, and regulation and imposed policies that dramatically increased backlogs and nearly halted adjudication. Misusing the tools of "prosecutorial discretion" — justifications for not prosecuting a case — and "administrative closure" — continuances granted to avoid trial — prompted dismissals and ever-growing caseloads. These are the most recent failures in a long line of failures that have helped unmake a court system and its enforcement assets, resulting — says the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals — in laws, regulations, and practices that engender "waste, delay, and confusion" for the government and the immigrant alike.<a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>These are not sudden failures, but incremental ones. Successive presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic, have authored problems that today fall just short of chaos in the operation of these courts. Their legacies — actions in the past that influence the present — are one source of this disorder. They have been abetted by generations of court executives who've hidden the bright markers of disarray to produce testimony and reports that from one year to the next misinformed Congress and the public.</p>
<p>The most definitive source of failure, though, was the Obama administration. Insisting borders were secure and enforcement effective<a href="#17"><sup>17</sup></a> as tens of thousands entered unhindered<a href="#18"><sup>18</sup></a> and hundreds of thousands more were never removed<a href="#19"><sup>19</sup></a> made worse the problems it inherited. Both national and domestic security are today jeopardized in the wake of this maladministration.<a href="#20"><sup>20</sup></a> For a presidency that promised better, borders remain porous,<a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a> enforcement slack,<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup></a> backlogs endless,<a href="#23"><sup>23</sup></a> court evasion commonplace,<a href="#24"><sup>24</sup></a> and removal orders unexecuted.<a href="#25"><sup>25</sup></a> Disorder — in this instance, a policy of injuries inflicted by a government upon its institutions, citizens, and hopefuls alike — rules, along with its calamitous twin, deception.<a href="#26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>"Absent" is the single word that defines these injuries. Absent attendance at court produces chronic failures to appear nearing a million people whose disappearances were muted in annual reports to Congress. Their numbers make up the largest part of unexecuted deportation orders. Absent enforcement — the flat refusal of a presidential administration to secure the borders and interior of the United States — has resulted in 953,506 violators unremoved years after their deportation orders were final, a 58 percent increase since 2002.<a href="#27"><sup>27</sup></a> While illegal aliens composed up to 41 percent of all criminal defendants prosecuted in U.S. federal district courts in 2010,<a href="#28"><sup>28</sup></a> no sustained efforts to stem illegal entry and remove offenders found their way into Obama administration policies, despite the fact that felony reentry into the United States was among the most common offenses charged.<a href="#29"><sup>29</sup></a> Instead, the opposite occurred. Enforcement waned<a href="#30"><sup>30</sup></a> as illegal entry across American borders waxed.<a href="#31"><sup>31</sup></a> Enforcement protocols fashioned over the last eight years pushed unexecuted deportation orders past a million on the watch of a president who assured Congress and the public of hardened borders and tough enforcement.</p>
<p>"Facts are stubborn things," Mark Twain reputedly observed, "but statistics are more pliable."<a href="#32"><sup>32</sup></a> Facts in this context are numbers and narratives twisted to understate the degree to which a court system missed and still misses its grave calling. Annual reports and high-minded Judiciary Committee testimony <i>can</i> change them, but cannot make the conditions that underlie them go away. Failure has been filtered by those obligated to report it and statistics have been shaped to give dysfunction not the glow of success, but the pallor of insignificance. Disaster has been courted.</p>
<h1>Absent Attendance — The Devil Is the Details</h1>
<p>U.S. immigration courts have the highest failure to appear (FTA) rate of any courts in the nation.<a href="#33"><sup>33</sup></a> Court numbers reveal dynamics never seen before in modern American jurisprudence. Studies disclose some state courts see up to 30 percent failure to appear rates for traffic and minor criminal offenses.<a href="#34"><sup>34</sup></a> The Bureau of Justice Statistics (a Justice Department agency) found that even some accused felons in state courts absconded at the rate of 25 percent.<a href="#35"><sup>35</sup></a> At nearly the same time, federal district courts experienced a lowly 1 percent failure to appear rate,<a href="#36"><sup>36</sup></a> despite the fact that 10 percent of all illegal aliens before them — a group numbering 11,362 people out of 116,321 — gained release prior to trial.<a href="#37"><sup>37</sup></a> Chicago's Cook County juvenile courts experienced failure to appear rates in the high thirties that eventually declined to less than 13 percent.<a href="#38"><sup>38</sup></a> But no other courts, state or federal, come near the rates consistently seen by America's immigration courts and have done so little about it.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, 37 percent of all aliens free pending their trials — 918,098 out of 2,498,375 — never showed for court.<a href="#39"><sup>39</sup></a> Courtrooms, like borders, are porous. On average, 46,000<a href="#40"><sup>40</sup></a> people each year vanished from proceedings created specifically for those claiming persecution in the lands they called home.<a href="#41"><sup>41</sup></a> Few things diminish a court system more. "Failures to appear", write court observers, "undermine the integrity of the justice system" and "erode the respect that an independent judiciary deserves."<a href="#42"><sup>42</sup></a> More than respect was eroded, though. Enforcement was disabled.</p>
<p>Disabled, in fact, by its own protocols that determined who should be released.<a href="#43"><sup>43</sup></a> A 2006 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Inspector General report concluded the department's ability "to detain and remove illegal aliens with final orders of removal" was hindered by their "propensity ... to disobey orders to appear in immigration court" and their consequent flight from deportation.<a href="#44"><sup>44</sup></a> DHS, in short, could not ensure effective enforcement of removal orders against those free pending trial.<a href="#45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Basic tools to assure against both were not applied by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) leadership for broader use among the general population of aliens released on their own recognizance. Where they were used — within limited groups from the 1.8 million aliens on varying degrees of supervision — absconding plummeted. Alternatives to detention (ATD's) like ankle monitors, telephonic reporting and reminding calls, and home and job-site visits — tools used with success every day in state courts across America — worked, but found only spare use before, during, and after immigration court proceedings from which aliens frequently disappeared. Risk assessments used by ICE showed promise, with failure to appear rates falling in some sample groups more than 50 percent.<a href="#46"><sup>46</sup></a> Regardless, the DHS inspector general found as recently as February 2015 that ICE's Risk Classification Assessment (RCA) — guidance intended to assist custody decisions — was, on the whole, time-consuming, resource-intensive, and ineffective in determining which aliens to release and under what conditions.<a href="#47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>Some alternatives to detention still gave encouragement. Success stories noted a 99.7 percent attendance rate at court and an 85 percent compliance rate with final orders of removal inside a monitored population of 42,000.<a href="#48"><sup>48</sup></a> The same report acknowledged that as supervision was relaxed compliance fell, with the consequent evasion of removal orders equaling 55 percent in a more lightly monitored group.<a href="#49"><sup>49</sup></a> Yet wider use of methods that would mitigate absconding — including detention — trail this long-standing problem. Despite progress with smaller samples of offenders and the comparative low cost-to-benefit ratio when contrasted to detention, success across the spectrum of all non-detained aliens still proves elusive, if not impossible, for those in charge at ICE. As elusive, it turns out, as getting credible information from court reports on the same issue.</p>
<p>While ICE leadership failed to remedy this problem, court management covered it up. While court evasions grew, court executives masked it with soft graphs and friendly numbers that belied what was really going on. Scrutiny shows that for years these executives skewed numbers to paint a much different picture of this dynamic than honest bookkeeping supported.<a href="#50"><sup>50</sup></a> Gamed numbers hid the problem. Congress and the public were — and still are — misled by accounting gimmicks that would send a private-sector CPA to jail.</p>
<p>What the courts offered were distinctions without differences. Whether they called it the failure to appear rate (their former name for court evasion) or the <i>in absentia</i> rate (the name they presently give it),<a href="#51"><sup>51</sup></a> the same thing each year back to 1996 has been measured largely the same way and the number the courts always report to Congress is the one that shrinks evasion to a figure that obscures the problem. (See Figure 1.) From 1996 through 2012, the courts labeled evasions as the "overall failure to appear rate" or, more simply, the "failure to appear rate". What they measured was the frequency of <i>in absentia</i> orders (removal orders issued in the absence of the litigant) from the entire population of orders granting relief, termination, or directing removal and called it the failure to appear rate. Not only did this population include orders involving aliens free before trial, it also included those persons who almost never failed to appear in court: detained aliens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/metcalf-absent-enforcement-f1.png"/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>Including detained aliens had significant effect. In short, it artificially reduced the failure to appear rate. Some years failures to appear exceeded or nearly exceeded the rates declared to Congress by more than 100 percent.<a href="#52"><sup>52</sup></a> The courts stated the FTA rate was 19 percent in 2007, when it was actually 36 percent. In 2008, the courts stated the FTA rate was 16 percent. Instead, it was 34 percent. In 2009, the courts proudly declared failures to appear came in at 11 percent — and noted it was the lowest number in five years. The real number was 26 percent. <a href="#53"><sup>53</sup></a> From 2010 to 2014, the same dynamic is present. Actual failure to appear rates nearly doubled or more than doubled what the courts told Congress (see Figure 1). Here the devil isn't in the details. The devil <i>is</i> the details.</p>
<p>In 2013, the courts changed the name for court evasions, replacing "failure to appear rate" with the term "<i>in absentia</i> rate". Changing labels changed nothing, though. Virtually the same thing was measured the same way. Never from 1996 through today have the courts been candid about this critical metric. Congress and the public are misled each year by a marquee number that is consistently lower than what accurate statistics support. Instead of a direct comparison of those aliens free before trial who failed to make court out of all aliens free before trial, the courts compared those who failed to appear to the much larger number of all those who were free before trial <i>plus</i> all those who were detained before trial.</p>
<p>The courts' deception works this way: First, they declare the number of aliens who failed to show for their hearings. This is the numerator. Next they combine the total number of aliens free pending trial <i>with</i> the total number of aliens <i>held in detention</i>. This is the denominator. Then the courts divide the numerator (those who failed to appear) by the denominator (all aliens free pending trial <i>plus</i> all aliens in detention). This division always yields a lower number than the actual failure to appear rate. Because the courts include in their equation aliens in detention — persons who have no choice but to appear in court — they enlarge the denominator and, by doing so, shrink the value of the numerator. In turn, they make failures to appear seem lower — and less significant — than they really are.</p>
<p>The courts' most recent annual report provides a telling example of this institutional misguidance. Here's how they did it. Conceding 38,229 aliens ran from court in 2015, court executives didn't compare the runaways to all aliens free pending trial, <i>i.e.</i> 38,229 ÷ 88,868 = 43 percent. Instead, they added all aliens in detention to the denominator, so the equation was 38,229 ÷ 139,048 (88,868 aliens free pending trial + 50,180 aliens in detention) = 27 percent.<a href="#54"><sup>54</sup></a> Nowhere in 20 years of annual reports are direct comparisons ever made between aliens free before trial who fled court vs. all aliens free before trial. Using this method, the courts minimized failures to appear in 2015 and every year reported back to 1996 and in the process hid the fact that nearly two-fifths of all those released on their own recognizance never made it to court.<a href="#55"><sup>55</sup></a> Candor fails this agency and aggregating 20 years of annual reports shows just how badly.</p>
<p>Declaring that aliens failed to appear in court 27 percent of the time in 2015, court executives grossly understated court evasion.<a href="#56"><sup>56</sup></a> No-shows were underreported to Congress by a factor of 37 percent.<a href="#57"><sup>57</sup></a> Accuracy shows 38,229 aliens free pending trial out of a total of 88,868 simply disappeared and this number is not an outlier. It is wholly consistent with a two-decades-long track record of litigants skipping court with impunity and wholly inconsistent with the courts' duty "to provide accurate and credible statistics that will permit policy debates to be ... about policy, not about the credibility of the data."<a href="#58"><sup>58</sup></a> Since 2012, failures to appear have increased 95 percent.<a href="#59"><sup>59</sup></a> The FTA rate of 43 percent in 2015 is the highest number since 2006, when 59 percent of aliens free pending trial never made it to court.<a href="#60"><sup>60</sup></a> These are not the metrics of past, present, or future success.</p>
<p>The courts' latest spin on failures to appear — the <i>in absentia</i> rate — engages them in further sleight of hand. They ignore in any narratives describing the <i>in absentia</i> rate that only those free pending trial can receive an <i>in absentia</i> order of removal.<a href="#61"><sup>61</sup></a> Regardless, the courts include aliens held in detention when calculating this rate. Including this group dilutes the <i>in absentia</i> rate, the same way it did when the courts called this statistic the failure to appear rate — and that presumably is the point. Court executives would rather dilute this metric and be implicated in data manipulation than confirm the fact that over 20 years an average of 46,000 people each year never made their court dates and became fugitives. A very real 37 percent failure to appear rate is nothing to brag about at congressional oversight hearings.</p>
<p>The courts admitted in their 2002 and 2007 annual reports that detained aliens seldom miss court. <a href="#62"><sup>62</sup></a> Detained aliens miss, if at all, because of illness or transportation problems. In fact, their misses are so rare that court executives <i>never</i> break them out in annual reports. Nor are these misses tallied as failures to appear. Instead, new court dates are scheduled for them.<a href="#63"><sup>63</sup></a> Yet the courts' leadership persistently included this group in annual summaries submitted to Congress because in prior years it lowered the failure to appear rate in the same way it is now used to lower the <i>in absentia</i> rate. Basic statistics courses call this "mixing different populations" — in other words, combining "apples and oranges".<a href="#64"><sup>64</sup></a> In America's immigration courts, it's called business as usual.</p>
<p>The courts' use of labels — "failure to appear rate" and "<i>in absentia</i> rate" — wrongly characterizes all aliens as absconders when the problem is limited solely to one group: <i>aliens free before trial</i>. These labels impair understanding of court evasion and insidiously promote stereotypes regarding the foreign-born. The many multiple opportunities for the courts to provide Congress and the public with critical analysis have been ignored at oversight hearings and in annual reports throughout the courts' history. The consequence of shallow reporting could not be clearer. Congress cannot fix a problem that isn't identified as one. Errant reporting isn't incidental in the life of these courts. It is, in fact, routine and its effect is nothing less than corrosive to the courts themselves and to the public's perception of its immigration mechanisms.</p>
<p>How other agencies measure this same dynamic reveals how deceptive the courts have been. Both the Justice Department (through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, BJS) and DHS (through ICE) track failures to appear. BJS, in examining failure to appear rates for accused felons in state courts, made direct comparisons. Accused felons who absconded from court were compared to all accused felons free pending their court dates.<a href="#65"><sup>65</sup></a> ICE did the same thing the same way with aliens who failed to appear in immigration courts. It compared aliens who failed to appear in court to all aliens free pending court. ICE found court evasion rates were significantly higher than those reported by the courts.<a href="#66"><sup>66</sup></a> Finally, academic studies examining failure to appear rates in a variety of state courts uniformly compared those who failed to appear in court solely to those free pending their court appearances.<a href="#67"><sup>67</sup></a> Never were those in custody included in their control groups. Unlike immigration courts, data manipulation did not carry over to these federal agencies or to those non-governmental organizations analyzing failures to appear in state courts.</p>
<p>Distrust of the courts is not just about the methods used to tell Congress how many aliens evade court. It is also about bleached numbers that led Congress and the public away from understanding a dynamic that witnessed just short of a million people walking away from court, seldom to be seen again, and it has a context well beyond annual reports. In a time of peace, these annual reports might be forgiven as harmless understatement. In a time of porous borders, drug cartels, alien smuggling, human trafficking, immigration fraud, and a still-raging War on Terror, gamed numbers conceal risk to national security. They disguise the actual weakness of courts and enforcement in addressing chaotic conditions entirely the making of those in charge.</p>
<p>In any other court system, such dysfunction would scream for redress. Only in U.S. immigration courts can litigants literally abandon their cases without fear of incarceration or removal, while litigants in nearly any other state or federal court risk arrest, contempt, and new charges for the same conduct. Federal law — 18 U.S.C. § 3146 — imposes penalties from one year all the way to 15 years for absconding from a federal district court. Not so in federal immigration courts. Rarely, if at all, are aliens held accountable for the same conduct that in other court systems would land them in jail and in some instances brand them a felon.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Another story — the five years on either side of September 11, 2001 — tells of dysfunction the courts never shared with Congress. (See Figure 2.) Court evasions did not decrease after 9/11. <i>They increased</i>. From 1996 through 2000, 251,309 of the 726,164 aliens free pending trial disappeared.<a href="#68"><sup>68</sup></a> Fully 35 percent of those persons the United States allowed to remain free before trial never showed for court.<a href="#69"><sup>69</sup></a> In the five years following 9/11 — from 2002 through 2006 — failures to appear exploded. Fifty percent of all of litigants free pending trial — 360,199 out of 713,974 — skipped their hearings.<a href="#70"><sup>70</sup></a> Within the raw memory of the fallen World Trade Center towers in New York, 59 percent of aliens free on their own recognizance fled their hearings in 2005 and 2006. Yet the courts stated with the straightest of bureaucratic faces that <i>only</i> 39 percent went missing.<a href="#71"><sup>71</sup></a> Rather than tell Congress that three-fifths of those summoned to immigration courts never showed in these years, the easy way out was the old way out. Enlarging the denominator by adding those in custody shrank the numerator of those who absconded and, in the end, diluted the failure to appear rate. Two-fifths of litigants never showing for court — instead of the three-fifths that actually dodged their dates — became the narrative that stuck in annual reports to Congress.<a href="#72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p>Fourteen years after 9/11, failure to appear rates remained stubbornly high and are again on the rise.<a href="#73"><sup>73</sup></a> The failure to appear average for the years <i>after</i> 9/11 exceeds the 35 percent failure to appear average <i>before</i> 9/11. (See Figure 3.) From 2002 through 2015, 43 percent of aliens free pending trial never saw the inside of a courtroom or, if they did, they never came back. Out of 1,445,248 aliens released on their own recognizance, 622,009 vanished.<a href="#74"><sup>74</sup></a> Stasis, failure, and mendacity have been standardized by this American court<a href="#75"><sup>75</sup></a> and its flagship agency, the Department of Justice.<a href="#76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/metcalf-absetn-f3.png"/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 1996, deportation orders total 2,991,273. Of this number, 1,771,314 aliens were ordered removed from detention facilities. Another 1,219,959 persons free pending trial received removal orders. Breaking down these numbers shows 301,861 litigants completed their trials, but lost their cases and were ordered removed. The balance — 918,098 — never showed for court and were ordered deported <i>in absentia</i>.<a href="#77"><sup>77</sup></a> By fractions, 75 percent of all removal orders against aliens free before trial were imposed for failure to appear (918,098 ÷ 1,219,959 = 75 percent).<a href="#78"><sup>78</sup></a> <i>in absentia</i> removal orders (see Figure 4) are the largest set of orders for aliens outside detention, <i>not</i> verdicts from proceedings they actually attended and finished. A trial court is three times more likely to issue a removal order for failure to appear than a removal order based on the merits of a fully litigated claim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/metcalf-absent-enforcement-f4.png"/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>From 1996 through 2015, 918,098 out of 2,498,375 aliens free before trial absconded. How this 37 percent escaped the notice of Congress addresses itself to leadership that did not lead,<a href="#79"><sup>79</sup></a> but was instead bent upon political objectives dramatically at odds with the facts of court evasion, safe neighborhoods, and national security.<a href="#80"><sup>80</sup></a> For even as absconding climbed ever higher during these years, no word from court officials or Justice Department higher-ups warned of this looming enforcement and court-made disaster. Instead, the courts' accounting, and the narratives that interpreted it, laid down a smokescreen that concealed evasion. Court executives submitted annual reports that belied high evasion rates that began with release from ICE custody — and in some cases no custody at all<a href="#81"><sup>81</sup></a> — and ended with removal orders for failures to appear that went largely ignored.</p>
<p>Ignored, but not uncounted, nor with risk unassessed. Asylum statistics, from 2003 through 2015, reveal 576,893 aliens failed their appearances in immigration courts. Among them numbered 3,095 aliens from the 36 nations labeled Specially Designated Countries (SDCs) because they "promote, produce, or protect terrorist organizations or their members."<a href="#82"><sup>82</sup></a> Formerly known as Special Interest Countries (SICs), changing the label didn't change the risk.<a href="#83"><sup>83</sup></a> From these same countries, 62,409 people filed applications for asylum. Of these, 24,975 applications were granted and 20,393 were denied. Another 8,237 applicants withdrew their requests for asylum prior to a trial court issuing a decision on their applications.<a href="#84"><sup>84</sup></a> (See Figure 5.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/metcalf-absent-enforcement-f5.png"/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>In other words, a total of 31,725 applicants — 51 percent altogether — were either ordered removed or sought another method to remain in the United States by withdrawing their applications.<a href="#85"><sup>85</sup></a> Yet no accounting from the courts or DHS tells Congress or the public what eventually became of these people once inside American borders. Though some certainly were in custody and were removed after their applications were denied, others were released and absconded from their asylum hearings, while others disappeared after an order of removal was issued. All that is known is that more half of all applicants did not receive grants of asylum. A documented history of court evasion coupled with avoidance of removal orders explains the risk of allowing onto our shores those about whom little is known, often until it is too late. These numbers also explain DHS warnings as it confronted potential backlash from release protocols that raised concern rather than relief.</p>
<p>A 2003 DHS Inspector General report found the now defunct INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) ineffective in removing aliens from nations with terrorist links: "[W]e examined three important subgroups of non-detained aliens," stated the IG, "and found that the INS was ... ineffective at removing potential high-risk groups of non-detained aliens." The IG examined groups including aliens from countries the State Department identified as sponsors of terrorism and found "only 6 percent [were] removed."<a href="#86"><sup>86</sup></a> By 2006, things improved, but were hardly better.<a href="#87"><sup>87</sup></a> Another DHS report summed it up:</p>
<blockquote><p>From FY (fiscal year) 2001 through the first half of FY 2005, 91,516 SIC (Special Interest Countries regarding terrorism) and SST (state sponsors of terrorism) aliens were apprehended, of which 45,000 (49 percent) were later released. It is not known exactly how many of these SIC and SST aliens were ultimately issued final orders of removal and were actually removed. ... However, assuming SIC and SST aliens are being removed at the same rate as other apprehended and released aliens, 85 percent of the SIC and SST aliens released who eventually receive final orders of removal will abscond.<a href="#88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet fearing these migrants would abscond at the same 85 percent rate as non-SIC migrants, DHS still released them. Admittedly, asylum statistics from the 36 SDCs and DHS absconding reports are not the same things, but incidentally address the same problems with those of the same national origin: aliens from nations friendly to terrorism who disappear after their admission into the United States. It is here that aliens who fail to appear in court — whether they later commit misdemeanors or felonies, plot acts of terrorism or simply try to find work — intersect with failures to enforce removal orders. It is here also that numbers speak more clearly than anything else and reveal risks that cannot be ignored except at the cost of American lives. More than 107,000 aliens from SDCs were present in the United States in 2009. Only 1,500 were in custody.<a href="#89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p>Applicants from those countries identified as state sponsors of terrorism (SSTs) — Iran, Sudan, and Syria — give more than a glimpse into these risks that begin with asylum requests. Together they compose a disproportionate share of those who apply for sanctuary as well as those who disappear from court proceedings.<a href="#90"><sup>90</sup></a> (See Tables 6A and 6B.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><center><img alt="" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229im_/https://cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/metcalf-absent-enforcement-f6a.png"/></center>

<p> </p>
<p>Of the 62,409 asylum applications that came from the 36 SDCs, 10 percent or 6,279 came from Iran, Sudan, and Syria. From these three countries alone came 11 percent or 338 of those who absconded from court from a total of 3,095. Only 9 percent were granted asylum, or 2,261 out of 24,975, and only 8 percent — 1,699 out of 20,393 — experienced denial of their asylum claims.<a href="#91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p>Applications from Iranians weigh heaviest on these percentages. These applicants filed more than twice as many requests for asylum than those filed by applicants from Sudan or Syria and were more than half of all applications received from the three countries, 3,457 out of 6,279. Nearly 40 percent of Iranian asylum requests were granted — 1,359 out of 3,457 — but these applicants also lost 27 percent of their asylum cases — 915 out of 3,457. Troublingly, they became runaways three times more often than Sudanese or Syrian asylum-seekers — 215 no-shows compared to 64 for Sudan and 59 for Syria. An alert perspective is needed here.<a href="#92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p>Risk, like opportunity, abounds from the fluid movement of people across the globe. Threats to the United States from any particular group of persons — whether asylees, refugees, permanent residents, naturalized or native-born citizens — is difficult to predict, but in the current state of world affairs not hard to identify. Drug cartels seek access to American traffickers and their clientele. Alien smugglers want American dollars for their human cargo. Chinese spies holding business visas — like the Soviet spies before them — attempt theft of American high-tech secrets. Radical Islam has its objectives, too. It seeks regional dominance and world influence, largely by disabling the West, in order to spread its lethal version of faith at the point of a knife, a gun, a nuclear weapon, or a hidden jihadist. More than any other adversary, it attempts to insert followers through porous borders<a href="#93"><sup>93</sup></a> or into the largely unvetted refugees from the Middle East that seek sanctuary in the United States.<a href="#94"><sup>94</sup></a> All these risks urge vigilance at every checkpoint in the immigration process, including stricter supervision of those free pending their hearings, broader use of detention for the suspect, and swift removal of those who fail the generous litmus of American immigration laws.</p>
<p>Courts unable to compel enforcement of their own orders cannot command the respect of litigants<a href="#95"><sup>95</sup></a> and court evasion that began a steady rise in the late 1990's is still unchecked today.<a href="#96"><sup>96</sup></a> To visa overstayers and those who enter illegally, frail immigration courts are only speed bumps: easily passed, quickly forgotten, and rarely respected. And court executives and Justice Department officials who game the courts' statistics have ignored the high calling of federal service to serve political expedients that have diminished these tribunals. On their watch, nearly one million people ran from court and never looked back.</p>
<h1>Absent Enforcement — Removal Is Rare</h1>
<p>Nor should they. Since 2002, unexecuted removal orders have increased 58 percent — from 602,000 to 953,506. Over the last 14 years an average of 25,107 were added each year to this total which in turn, invited more illegal entry and further disregard for courts that cannot direct the execution of their own orders.<a href="#97"><sup>97</sup></a> The past is prologue for this shambles.</p>
<p>A 1989 report by the General Accounting Office (GAO, now called the Government Accountability Office) found that "[a]liens have nothing to lose by failing to appear for hearings and, in effect, ignoring the deportation process."<a href="#98"><sup>98</sup></a> Over the preceding 30 years, GAO noted, illegal entry into the United States increased by 2,200 percent — from 45,000 in 1959 to 1.2 million in 1989<a href="#99"><sup>99</sup></a> — and, as illegal entry grew, failures to appear in court became a significant problem.<a href="#100"><sup>100</sup></a> Select audits revealed a 27 percent failure to appear rate in that year alone.<a href="#101"><sup>101</sup></a> This was an average, though. Failures to appear spiked to 68 percent in Miami in 1985 and to 63 percent and 46 percent in New York and Los Angeles, respectively, in 1989.<a href="#102"><sup>102</sup></a> Uniformly, absconders were foreign nationals who had posted cash bonds that were forfeit upon their disappearance, not those who were released on their own recognizance.<a href="#103"><sup>103</sup></a> By 1996, DoJ's inspector general found that 89 percent of non-detained aliens who were ordered removed had fled court and were still at large. <a href="#104"><sup>104</sup></a> Even in the event of arrest and re-arraignment before an immigration court, sanctions, if any, were nearly non-existent.</p>
<p>Indeed, GAO found aliens who failed to appear at their deportation hearings "do not suffer penalties ... or such adverse consequences as loss of appeal rights or denial of the rights to claim relief from deportation." "Even if they are reapprehended," reported the IG, "the deportation process continues where it was interrupted" by their absconding. Not only did they pick up where they left off, but GAO determined "the additional time aliens ... accumulated in the country by avoiding deportation proceedings [might] support their requests for relief from deportation because of their good conduct while they were here." In short, aliens who absconded from court were rewarded for bad conduct. A "failure to appear[did] not jeopardize their claim of good conduct when applying for relief " from removal.<a href="#105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p>Things have changed little since this was written decades ago. Judges report that in today's permissive environment aliens who have for years avoided removal orders now ask the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to reopen their cases. Their justifications vary as much as the aliens themselves. Some claim parentage of U.S. citizen children. Others assert marriages to U.S. citizens. Still others plead a fear of persecution if returned to their home countries, despite their asylum claims being denied years before. Judges further report many of these efforts to reopen old cases in which a removal order was entered are successful and that absconders are allowed to regularize their presence and gain a path to citizenship through the BIA's adoption of a "totality of the circumstances" test, a concept without statutory or regulatory precedent. Bad conduct, in effect, is still being rewarded. Removal — in this case, the enforcement of a deportation order when a fugitive alien reveals his presence through a motion to reopen — is never initiated. An earlier finding by GAO in its 1989 report, besides being accurate, was also predictive. "Disregard for the courts," it declared, stemmed from a "lack of repercussions" — in other words, no consequences — because few aliens were actually deported.<a href="#106"><sup>106</sup></a> Nor, as numbers would show, did the situation improve.</p>
<p>Fourteen years later, circumstances were nearly identical. A 2003 DoJ inspector general's report found no more than 3 percent of asylum seekers ordered deported and only 35 percent of criminal aliens actually removed. Even after federal circuit courts yearly affirmed deportation verdicts by the thousands, aliens ordered deported remained in the United States because DHS was no better at enforcing the orders of federal appellate courts than it was of immigration trial courts.<a href="#107"><sup>107</sup></a> A DHS inspector general report in 2006 spotlit this disarray:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historical trends indicate that 62 percent of the aliens released [from detention] will eventually be issued final orders of removal by the U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and later fail to surrender for removal or abscond. ... [I]t is unlikely that many of the released aliens will ever be removed.<a href="#108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Practice proved prediction. In its 2008 annual report, Immigration and Customs and Enforcement declared that the fugitive alien population — 594,756 aliens who fled deportation orders — was reduced only 6 percent, to 557,762, by arrests and removals.<a href="#109"><sup>109</sup></a> Another 35,094 fugitive aliens were removed in 2009 — leaving 522,668 at large.<a href="#110"><sup>110</sup></a> In contrast to aliens who run from court and are seldom seen again, on average 70 percent of accused felons who fled prosecutions in state courts were caught within one year.<a href="#111"><sup>111</sup></a></p>
<p>Even if aliens were arrested, Obama administration rules required ICE agents to release or ignore offenders unless they had serious criminal records.<a href="#112"><sup>112</sup></a> At least three misdemeanors were required to invoke arrest and removal, but not just any misdemeanors. ICE leadership demanded offenses such as domestic violence, sexual offenses, and third offense DUIs before its enforcement officers could arrest an illegal alien, even if they'd previously been ordered removed.<a href="#113"><sup>113</sup></a> Removal orders, as it turned out, meant less and less to that administration.</p>
<p>"All should be troubled," wrote Judge Edward Grant of the Board of Immigration Appeals, "by the fact that only a small fraction of final orders of deportation and removal — entered after a hearing before an immigration judge, with right of appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals — are actually executed." He went further: "This fact would surely not be comforting to judges of the United States courts of appeals, who have strained in recent years to manage a burgeoning docket of immigration cases."<a href="#114"><sup>114</sup></a></p>
<p>That was in 2006. What was then a strong likelihood that a deportation order would never be executed became a near certainty. Non-criminal alien removals from the United States in 2015 — a total of 69,478 — reached a low not seen since 2003 when 126,720 non-criminal aliens were deported pursuant to removal orders.<a href="#115"><sup>115</sup></a>The bulk of removals came from orders issued inside detention facilities or to criminal aliens, not those handed down in courtrooms outside detention facilities.<a href="#116"><sup>116</sup></a> An early Obama administration declaration confirms the direction this administration pursued since its beginnings in 2009. ICE spokesman, Richard Rocha, signaled on August 26, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The Obama] Administration is committed to smart, effective immigration reform, prioritizing the arrest and removal of criminal aliens and those who pose a danger to national security. In 2010 to date, ICE has removed more than 150,000 convicted criminals — a record number. ... ICE has implemented a new policy to expedite the removal of criminal aliens and those who pose a danger to national security by ensuring these cases are heard.<a href="#117"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No less than President Obama provided the clearest confirmation that his administration's enforcement priorities excluded the nation's interior and non-criminal aliens. On September 28, 2011, he explained that deportation statistics were misleading and that, in addition to criminals, another group was being deported who didn't pass through immigration courts.<br/>
"[T]he statistics are actually a little deceptive," he said, "because what we've been doing is ... apprehending folks at the borders and sending them back. That is counted as a deportation, even though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours."<a href="#118"><sup>118</sup></a> Criminal aliens and recent illegal border-crossers then were removed, but few others. A Migration Policy Institute study agreed: "[N]inety-five percent of the immigrants deported from 2009 to 2013 were criminal aliens ... meaning only about 77,000 of the 1.6 million illegal immigrants removed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over the last five years were rank-and-file border-crossers with clean records."<a href="#119"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p>ICE refused to remove those who entered illegally and made it well past the border as well as those who overstayed their visas, lost or ran from their asylum hearings, and those ordered removed whose profiles didn't match the enforcement priorities of the Obama administration. Apparent then and even more apparent now is that America's immigration enforcement system fell into the hands of those who for eight years took stock of a refined body of law at odds with their own political objectives and, in consequence, ignored it where possible or, failing that, attempted to go around it through executive orders and what administration officials termed "prosecutorial discretion". The results offer no surprises.</p>
<p>Flight from court and disobedience to statutory removal orders, if not officially sanctioned, were unofficially encouraged by an administration whose enforcement essentially didn't enforce. Constitutional history offers no similar parallels to this refusal to execute the removal mandate of 8 U.S.C. 1231, requiring deportation within 90 days of removal orders becoming final.<a href="#120"><sup>120</sup></a> Its organic underpinning that "Congress shall have power to ... establish a uniform rule of naturalization,"<a href="#121"><sup>121</sup></a> confronted executive rulemaking that mocked congressional intent and revealed a president bent on making laws on his own.<a href="#122"><sup>122</sup></a> This is nothing less than absolutism.<a href="#123"><sup>123</sup></a> President Obama's attempt to regulate an area reserved to Congress without laws upon which to base his expansive interpretation of executive authority ended predictably.<a href="#124"><sup>124</sup></a> These efforts exposed defects irreconcilable with due process and equal protection among citizens and the foreign-born who reside here legally and those who do not.</p>
<p>Under Obama administration protocols, illegal entrants were treated remarkably better than their citizen and legal entrant opposites. Were citizens, visa holders, or lawful permanent residents to commit crimes that ICE declared insufficient to arrest and remove an illegal entrant — crimes such as shoplifting and identity theft, low-level DUIs, misdemeanor assaults, and illegal voting — law enforcement response would be prompt and certain. Criminal proceedings would follow with records generated that would influence federal and state enforcement efforts in the event of future offenses. Visa holders would be denied extensions of their U.S. stays or become inadmissible when applying to reenter.<a href="#125"><sup>125</sup></a> Lawful permanent residents would be subject to removal proceedings for committing crimes of moral turpitude or aggravated felonies.<a href="#126"><sup>126</sup></a> But in the inverse world of immigration enforcement, ICE officers were directed to not only avoid taking into custody aliens who committed criminal offenses like these, but to release them or, in the alternative, cease prosecuting them.<a href="#127"><sup>127</sup></a> In other words, set loose on the public those who committed offenses that would put citizens behind bars for up to a year.<a href="#128"><sup>128</sup></a> Blurring the lines between those who entered and remained legally and those who did not effectively disabled federal enforcement and helped encourage the mass migration from Central America now witnessed at the Southwest border.<a href="#129"><sup>129</sup></a> From 2012 through 2016, Southwest border apprehensions of "other than Mexicans" (virtually all from Central America) totaled 859,546.<a href="#130"><sup>130</sup></a></p>
<p>Encouraged is not too strong a word to describe what ICE's political leadership did to minimize enforcement. ICE leadership announced on August 17, 2009,<a href="#131"><sup>131</sup></a> that it was disbanding its fugitive operations teams that made removal of absconders an enforcement priority.<a href="#132"><sup>132</sup></a> The same leadership likewise dismantled the Secure Communities Program<a href="#133"><sup>133</sup></a> and left in place of both the Priority Enforcement Program.<a href="#134"><sup>134</sup></a> In turn, interior enforcement against illegal entrants and criminal and fugitive aliens retreated and what enforcement was left dealt with only what ICE considered the worst offenders. In the wake of this retreat, unexecuted removal orders have increased 351,506 since 2002. Around 179,000 criminal aliens have "final orders of removal", but cannot be found.<a href="#135"><sup>135</sup></a> Non-enforcement brings other results, too.<a href="#136"><sup>136</sup></a></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The willingness of migrants to enter illegally<a href="#137"><sup>137</sup></a> or attempt fraudulent entry at ports across the United States remains unshaken.<a href="#138"><sup>138</sup></a> Non-enforcement echoes as policy when as many as 90 percent of Central American youths in 2015 — some 135,000 according to the House Judiciary Committee — skipped court,<a href="#139"><sup>139</sup></a> while others expected <i>permisos</i> — documents granting permission to stay — after their 1,500-mile journeys north.<a href="#140"><sup>140</sup></a> A Customs and Border Patrol memo from its deputy chief, Ronald Vitiello, reported this dysfunction. "Releasing other than Mexican family units, credible fear claims, and low-threat aliens on their own recognizance, along with facilitating family reunification of [unaccompanied alien minors] in lieu of repatriation to their country of citizenship, serve as incentives for additional individuals to follow the same path," he wrote.<a href="#141"><sup>141</sup></a> He continued: "The large quantity of DHS interdiction, intelligence, investigation, processing, detention, and removal resources currently being dedicated to address [unaccompanied minors] is compromising DHS capabilities to address other trans-border criminal areas, such as human smuggling and trafficking and illicit drug, weapons, commercial, and financial operations."<a href="#142"><sup>142</sup></a> Few were stopped, but even fewer were removed.</p>
<p>Even felony records, as it turns out, were no guarantee of removal.<a href="#143"><sup>143</sup></a> Large numbers of ICE's Level I and II offenders — murderers, drug traffickers, kidnappers, and sex offenders — obtained release from ICE decision makers,<a href="#144"><sup>144</sup></a> only to again jeopardize the communities that once placed them behind bars and hopefully off U.S. soil. Having the highest removal priority made no difference.<a href="#145"><sup>145</sup></a> From 2013 through 2015, 86,288 criminal aliens — over whose custody and removal from the United States ICE had full discretion — were turned back on the American public.<a href="#146"><sup>146</sup></a> Since 2010, 124 criminal aliens were implicated in 135 deaths after ICE declined to remove them.<a href="#147"><sup>147</sup></a> Where removal to their home countries would have significantly reduced, if not eliminated, further threats to American neighborhoods, releasing these criminals prompted a return to the lifestyles that first made them felons. Criminal aliens proved the truism common to all lawbreakers regardless of nationality: Felony offenders tend to offend again<a href="#148"><sup>148</sup></a> and ICE's releasing them on an unsuspecting public proved the point.</p>
<p>A few other things proved the point, too. In 2014, criminal aliens in the United States numbered more than 2.1 million and, under Obama administration enforcement guidelines, these numbers have only grown.<a href="#149"><sup>149</sup></a> Any removal of these individuals presently means law enforcement had to wait for them to commit worse offenses that would compel their deportation. The whole purpose for the Obama administration's retreat in immigration enforcement over the last eight years was clearly stated in ICE's 2015 annual report. First admitting that it stepped back from enforcement, the agency revealed priorities unmet by its efforts:</p>
<blockquote><p>In executing its enforcement duties, ICE focuses on two core missions: 1) the identification and apprehension of criminal aliens and other priority aliens located in the U.S.; and 2) the detention and removal of those individuals apprehended in the interior of the United States as well as those apprehended by CBP officers and agents patrolling our nation's borders. ICE is committed to smart immigration enforcement, preventing terrorism, and combatting the illegal movement of people and goods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vows to remove criminal aliens and halt illegal entry collided with news reports of the same criminals committing new crimes and waves of Central Americans crossing the Southwest border with impunity. In short, core missions failed, words were at odds with deeds, and a watchful public took notice in 2016 and elected a candidate declaring secure borders and the certain removal of violators among his top priorities. When immigration enforcement under Barack Obama revealed itself as false advertising — tough talk unmatched by tough action — American voters took action on their own to fix the broken system that the candidate of 2008 left even more broken.</p>
<p></p><center class="text-align-justify">
<hr/><p>The smart enforcement initiatives of the Obama administration have meant little or no enforcement for many, including the American public. More than twice as many post-9/11 acts of terrorism — plots and attacks — occurred on American soil in the last eight years than all those under George W. Bush,<a href="#150"><sup>150</sup></a> as populations from SDC countries saw steady increase.<a href="#151"><sup>151</sup></a> Failure to enforce removal orders, secure borders, and deport criminal aliens provides further lessons in dim policy making. Illegal aliens now comprise a larger share of both state and federal prison populations that outpaces their percentage of the U.S. population.<a href="#152"><sup>152</sup></a> Still, the posture of the Obama administration was to continue freeing from removal criminal aliens who unsurprisingly offended again.<a href="#153"><sup>153</sup></a> The trafficking of goods and people by way of unauthorized entries and clandestine movement through drug cartels at the Southwest border did not slow to a trickle, but instead witnessed distinct acceleration.<a href="#154"><sup>154</sup></a> Chronic absconding from immigration courts continued unabated.<a href="#155"><sup>155</sup></a> Most telling of all, the number of illegal aliens present in the United States at the end of Barack Obama's second term — 11 million — is the same as it was in 2005 when George W. Bush began his second term.<a href="#156"><sup>156</sup></a> This is not how we define progress.</p>
<p></p></center>
<p>Stasis and failure are not new norms in American immigration, but merely old ones starting a new decade. Courting disaster is not an accident but, instead, a policy disconnected from rule of law and common sense that counts dysfunction as success and disorder as the price of progress, even at the loss of American jobs and the cost of American lives.</p>
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<ol><li>Absconding from immigration courts should result in removal orders that cannot be reopened or set aside. <i>in absentia</i> orders should also permanently deny any other form of relief that would allow an alien to legally re-enter or remain in the United States. Exceptions to this policy should only include an alien's assistance in matters of national security or assistance in federal criminal prosecution deemed in the national interest.</li>
<li>Aliens ordered deported should be placed in ICE custody at the conclusion of proceedings pursuant to 8 CFR 241.4 and held through confinement or under strict monitoring until released due to a removal order being overturned or until removed from the United States.</li>
<li>The discretion of ICE/ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) officials to grant administrative stays of removals that delay an alien's removal from the United States should not be available to Level I and II alien offenders or those aliens ordered deported pursuant to an <i>in absentia</i> order of removal except for purposes of national security assistance or federal criminal prosecution deemed in the national interest.</li>
<li>Immigration, asylum, refugee, and visa policies affecting Specially Designated Countries (SDCs) should be re-examined in light of terrorist attacks involving persons from these countries and with the purpose of limiting entry of persons who have not passed the same background checks that visa applicants must undergo. Providing sanctuary areas in the home countries of these persons or in neighboring countries with a strong U.S. presence should be a priority that protects the lives of innocent foreign nationals abroad and protects the lives of innocent Americans at home.</li>

States the article: "The elites of both parties agree the immigration system is broken and needs to be fixed. But no one has a serious plan to secure the border or enforce the immigration laws. Progressives believe that generous immigration policies reflect America's liberal humanitarian values. Big businesses depend on Hispanic immigration (both legal and illegal) as a reliable source of cheap labour. Neither party wants to alienate the Hispanic vote. And anyone who questions the wisdom of admitting a huge influx of low-skilled people into the United States is labelled as a nativist, a Tea Partier, or worse. In fact, the United States would be much better off with a system like Canada's and Australia's, which admits immigrants on the basis of education, skills and language ability. But it's probably too late now. One of the people who questions current U.S. immigration policy is George Borjas, a Harvard labour economist who has studied immigration economics for decades. He argues that the large-scale migration of low-skilled workers has hurt the economic opportunities of less-skilled natives. Businesses and affluent Americans gain; the people at the bottom lose."

Writes Mac Donald: "Resource starvation is not the only reason for federal inaction. The INS was a creature of immigration politics, and [in the 1980's and 1990's] INS district directors came under great pressure from local politicians to divert scarce resources into distribution of such 'benefits' as permanent residency, citizenship, and work permits, and away from criminal or other investigations. The … Citizenship USA project of 1996 was a … case of politics driving the INS to sacrifice enforcement to 'benefits.' … [and] the naturalization process radically expedited. [As a result] … processing errors in 1996 were 99 percent in New York and 90 percent in Los Angeles, and tens of thousands of aliens with criminal records, including murder and armed robbery, were naturalized." Ms. Mac Donald found both major political parties, presidential administrations, and Congress equally responsible over these periods. In many cases, state and local officials were impediments to criminal and civil law enforcement. As her article explains, both major political parties at all levels of government have failed to dignify rule of law.</p>

This accounted for roughly one out of every four of all PD closures nationwide. This is because the Los Angeles court handled a particularly large caseload along with having a high PD closure rate.

<p><a id="15" name="15"><sup>15</sup></a> The INS "Interior Enforcement Strategy", issued by DoJ in 1999 and adopted by DHS in 2003, developed priorities for enforcement efforts. The first priority is the detention and removal of criminal aliens. The second is the dismantling and diminishing of alien smuggling and trafficking operations. The third addresses responses to community complaints about illegal immigration, including those of law enforcement. The fourth priority regards investigating and prosecuting immigrant benefit and document fraud. The fifth involves deterrence of employers' use of unauthorized aliens. Overall, the strategy aims to deter illegal immigration, prevent immigration-related crimes, and remove those illegally in the United States.

It does reflect real problems in Central America with their economies and violence, but also active marketing by smugglers to parents, saying that they could get kids in. We brought that back down so the numbers are now below what they were two years ago. Overall, the border is less porous than it's been any time since the 1970s."</p>

Once again, smugglers are bringing hundreds of women and children each day to the Mexican banks of the river and sending them across in rafts. In a season when illegal crossings normally go down, 'The numbers have started going the other way,' said Raul L. Ortiz, acting chief of the Border Patrol for the Rio Grande Valley. Since Oct. 1, official figures show, Border Patrol apprehensions of migrant families in this region have increased 150 percent over the same period last year, while the number of unaccompanied children caught by agents has more than doubled. The new flows here are smaller than the surge in the summer of 2014, but come after a year of declines in illegal crossings across the southwest border. The increases come as Americans' concerns about border security are heightened after the Nov. 13, 2015 attacks in Paris raised fears that terrorists would try to sneak into the United States. And they are complicating the Obama administration's efforts to reassure the country that the border is under control."</p>

Federal officials say there are no indications that any of the migrants had radical history or intentions, and one of the groups did not try to sneak across the border but surrendered voluntarily. But the incidents come in a politically charged atmosphere, less than a week after the deadly Paris attacks by the Islamic State, as many Republican officials and some Democrats around the country argue that militants could be hiding among people fleeing the Syrian civil war and other conflicts. Advocates of stricter border control, including many border-region officials, have long cited the possibility that violent radicals could slip into the stream of Latin Americans crossing the United States' southern border. That has not been a common route for migrants from the Middle East, but any indication that it is becoming one could ratchet up security concerns. 'My fear—and what should be the fear of all Americans—is that terrorists are using well-established smuggling routes through Central America, through Mexico, and positioning themselves to come across the border,' said Sheriff Paul Babeu of Pinal County, Ariz., which straddles one of the region's major corridors for smuggling people and drugs into the country."</p>

According to ICE policy, in most cases immigration agents can no longer arrest persons solely for entering the United States illegally. Additionally, in most cases immigration agents cannot arrest persons solely because they have entered the United States with a visa and then overstayed that visa and failed to return to their country. Essentially, only individuals charged or convicted of very serious criminal offenses by other law enforcement agencies may be arrested or charged by ICE agents and officers for illegal entry and overstay. …[U]nder current policy individuals illegally in the United States must now be convicted of three or more criminal misdemeanors before ICE agents are permitted to charge or arrest the illegal alien for illegal entry or overstaying a visa, unless the misdemeanors involve the most serious types of offenses such as assault, sexual abuse or drug trafficking. With regard to traffic violations, other than DUI and fleeing the scene of an accident, ICE agents are also prohibited from making an immigration arrest of illegal aliens who have multiple convictions for traffic related misdemeanors."</p>

States the report: "[T]he illegal population grew significantly since 2013, when Pew and the Center for Migration Studies last estimated its size. Of course, this represents only an educated guess. To actually estimate the illegal population in the second quarter of 2015 would require administrative data that is not yet available, as well as other information. But the evidence, while preliminary and incomplete, does indicate that the number of illegal immigrants has increased in the last two years. ... [T]he increase in the Mexico-born population in the last year suggests that illegal immigration has increased. In addition to Mexico, growth in the immigrant population was led by a 449,000 increase in the number of immigrants from other Latin American countries in the last year. This 449,000 accounted for 27 percent of the growth in the total foreign-born population since 2014. Looking at growth in the last two years shows a 2.75 million increase in the immigrant population (See Figure 1 and Table 1). Mexico accounted for 921,000 (34 percent) of this growth and other Latin American countries accounted for 953,000 (35 percent). Most researchers have estimated that individuals from Mexico and Latin America accounted for eight in 10 illegal immigrants in the country. The significant growth of immigrants from all of Latin America over the last two years lends support to the idea that the number of illegal immigrants has begun to increase again."</p>

However, history indicates the saying first appeared in print in the <i>Fort Wayne News-Sentinel</i> in April 1927. The attribution has stuck, however. A similar quote is attributed to President John Adams, who spoke at length stating: "I will enlarge no more on the evidence, but submit it to you, gentlemen — Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."</p>

States the article in pertinent part: "One area of the criminal justice system where compliance is particularly lacking is in individuals' response to orders to appear in court for relatively minor offenses such as traffic offenses, misdemeanors, and low-level felonies. Non-custodial criminal defendants often fail to appear for court. This occurs for all kinds of mandated appearances: arraignment, pretrial (post-arraignment) hearings, trial, and post-trial. Initial (i.e., arraignment) failure-to-appear (FTA) rates for non-waiverable offenses are particularly problematic, as they involve the greatest volume of defendants. Many, if not most, of these individuals are not detained prior to trial (Goldkamp &amp; White, 2006; VanNostrand &amp; Keebler, 2009). There are a number of alternatives to pretrial detention (VanNostrand &amp; Keebler, 2009), the most common of which, for minor offenses, is simply to release individuals in the community with little if any government oversight, placing the burden to appear in court entirely on defendants themselves (Goldkamp &amp; White, 2006). Not surprisingly, this can result in substantial failure-to-appear (FTA) rates. FTA rates vary depending on jurisdiction and offense type, ranging from less than 10% (e.g., Cuvelier &amp; Potts, 1997; VanNostrand &amp; Keebler, 2009) to as high as 25-30% (e.g., Davis, 2005; Helland &amp; Tabarok, 2004; McGinty, 2000). These failures to appear are costly for both the court system and defendants (Levin, Kennel, Pellegrino, Simmons, &amp; Surett, 2007)."</p>

That year, consultants working on behalf of the National Institute of Correction's Jails Division completed a local system assessment showing that 33 percent of the county jail's inmates were compliance violators (<i>i.e.</i>, failure to comply with court orders by failing to appear, pay, or perform some task) up from only 8 percent in 1995. Subsequent jail-population analyses found that three-fourths of these compliance violators had been booked on failure to appear warrants for misdemeanor, traffic, or municipal offenses, and in 90 percent of the studied cases these FTA warrants were issued to defendants missing the very first court event in their case. … As a matter of jail-population management alone, a facility with roughly 25 percent of its inmates incarcerated for failing to appear for mostly lower-level offenses did not seem like the best use of the limited jail resources."

For example, the Cook County (IL) Juvenile Court's postcard reminder program reduced the failure-to-appear rate from 38% to 13% (Rohan, 2006). Similarly, an evaluation of Coconino County (AZ) showed a reduction in the percentage of failures to appear at initial appearance in adult misdemeanor cases from over 25% to less than 13% when the defendant was called in advance and reminded of the hearing date (White, 2006). Reminder programs in Arapahoe County (CO), Jefferson County (CO), and Multnomah County (OR) have also increased appearance rates and realized substantial labor and financial savings (Arapahoe County Justice Center, 2010; Jefferson County Criminal Justice Planning, 2006; O'Keefe, 2007).

Explained former Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Julie Myers Wood: "The purpose [of detention and alternatives to detention] is to ensure that detainees return home." Wood said it is tough to detain immigration detainees the right way because there are not a lot of facilities for civil detention. Wood discussed ICE's alternative to detention programs, which had 42,000 participants in 2012. Among this group as many as 99.7 percent of participants appeared for their final hearing, and 85 percent complied with final orders of removal.</p>
<p><a id="49" name="49"><sup>49</sup></a> <i>Ibid.</i> The alternatives to detention included phone-reporting and GPS systems as well as a full-service program that involved counseling on how to find a lawyer and obtain travel documents for deportation.

<p><a id="50" name="50"><sup>50</sup></a> The rosier picture in one respect is achieved by understating failure to appear (FTA) rates. This is accomplished, in part, through some bait and switch.

In this manner, FTA rates are understated or, put differently, suppressed. The courts never compare apples to apples.

<p><a id="75" name="75"><sup>75</sup></a> Twenty years' worth of annual court reports (called the EOIR statistical year books) show court officials defaulting to formulaic analyses that often hide as much as they reveal. In other words, the courts and DoJ are locked-in (and they, as is usually the case in such situations, hold the key to their own cell) and cling to routines that fail the oversight function of Congress and are ultimately harmful to the courts. Failures to appear have never been clearly explained to Congress and the public. Had they been, part of the disarray present on 9/11 might still have been in effect, but the blinders would have been off. They would have been able to tell Congress and the 9/11 Commission: "This is the problem we told you about. Help us fix it." Instead, the same dysfunction held sway and courts are now more ineffective than ever before.</p>

<p><a id="79" name="79"><sup>79</sup></a> The failure of America's immigration courts is not the fault of its judges or the aliens who appear before them. It is the failure of an institution and the executives put in charge of the courts. This failure is not limited to Democratic administrations. It is a Republican failure as well. History labels this failure wooden-headedness. "Wooden-headedness," writes historian Barbara Tuchman, is "the source of self-deception … [and] a factor that plays a remarkably large role in government. It consists in assessing a situation in terms of … fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs. It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be deflected by the facts." See Barbara W. Tuchman, <i>The March of Folly</i>, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1984, p. 7.</p>

In 2014, the FBI arrested approximately one dozen US-based ISIL supporters. In 2015, that number increased to approximately five dozen arrests. These individuals were arrested for a variety of reasons, predominantly for attempting to provide material support to ISIL.

Some of these failures to appear are due to sickness or forgetfulness and are quickly corrected, but many represent planned abscondments.

MPI said that 95 percent of the immigrants deported from 2009 to 2013 met Mr. Obama's stated national security priorities for deportations, meaning only about 77,000 of the 1.6 million illegal immigrants removed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over the last five years were rank-and-file border-crossers with clean records. Mr. Obama has pledged to try to refine his deportation policies later this year, but the MPI study, said he'll have to make major changes such as carving out exceptions for substantial categories of illegal immigrants if he's to make a dent in his deportation figures. That's because Mr. Obama has already placed most rank-and-file illegal immigrants living in the interior of the U.S. out of any danger for deportations, the MPI report concluded."</p>

In 1795, Congress claimed exclusive authority over naturalization by establishing new conditions — "and not otherwise" — for aliens "to become a citizen of the United States, or any of them."

The Take Care Clause (also known as the Faithful Execution Clause) is best read as a duty that qualifies the president's executive power. By virtue of his executive power, the president may execute the lawful and control the lawful execution of others. Under the Take Care Clause, however, the president must exercise his law-execution power to "take Care that the Laws be <i>faithfully</i> executed." The president possesses wide discretion in deciding how and even when to enforce laws. He also has a range of interpretive discretion in deciding the meaning of laws he must execute. When an appropriation provides discretion, the president can gauge when and how appropriated moneys can be spent most efficiently. However, the president may not prevent a member of the executive branch from performing a ministerial duty lawfully imposed upon him by Congress (<i>Marbury v. Madison</i> (1803); <i>Kendall v. United States ex rel. Stokes</i> (1838)). Nor may the president take an action not authorized either by the Constitution or by a lawful statute (<i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v.

Writes Guelzo: "As [Lincoln] explained to his impatient abolitionist secretary of the Treasury, Salmon Chase, he could not extend the Emancipation Proclamation further than 'any state, or designated part of a state' actually in rebellion without undermining the legal rationale of using his 'war powers.' And that would leave the whole emancipation project liable to interference from the same Supreme Court that had given the nation the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. "'The exemptions were made because the military necessity did not apply to the exempted localities,' Lincoln explained. If, as Commander in Chief, he tried to emancipate slaves outside the war zones, he would have no more justification for doing so than saying, 'I think the measure politically expedient, and morally right.' This would surrender 'all footing upon constitution or law' and plunge him into 'the boundless field of absolutism.'" This passage would be lost on the present administration. President Obama's DAPA announcement placed him squarely in the "boundless field of absolutism". See also Gideon Welles, diary entry for July 13, 1862, in <i>The Diary of Gideon Welles</i>, ed.

States Judge McConnell: "The <i>Immigration and Naturalization Act</i> defines persons who entered this country without authorization and do not fall into any of its specific exceptions as being here <i>unlawfully</i>. That includes the beneficiaries of the DAPA order. Among the consequences of <i>unlawful presence</i> are ineligibility for work permits and for many social welfare programs. Moreover, the INA expressly provides that every day a DAPA beneficiary spends in the United States should accrue as time under the individual's unlawful-presence clock. These consequences were set by Congress for the purpose of discouraging illegal immigration. And unlike deportation, which necessarily involves enforcement discretion, these consequences are absolute—unless there is an explicit statutory exception, these consequences apply to every person in this country unlawfully. Under the DAPA rule, some four million people who are unlawfully present in the United States under the statute have been given the dispensation to remain and to obtain work permits and social welfare benefits. Their unlawful-presence clocks do not run. This is not mere non-enforcement. It is not an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is not a matter of enforcement priorities. ... DAPA permits 'an individual ... to be lawfully present in the United States,' notwithstanding the INA's provisions to the contrary. Until such time as it might be revoked, its beneficiaries are no longer in violation of the law. Because the executive officials who promulgated DAPA are acting outside their statutory authority, and are making <i>lawful</i> what Congress has declared <i>unlawful</i>, they are in violation of the Take Care Clause of Article II."</p>

Per 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) an aggravated felony includes murder, rape, sexual abuse of a minor (which can include statutory rape), drug trafficking, trafficking in firearms or destructive devices, various other offenses concerning firearms or explosive materials, racketeering, money laundering of more than $10,000, fraud or tax evasion involving more than $10,000, theft or violent crime with a sentence order of at least one year, perjury with a sentence of at least one year, kidnapping, child pornography, trafficking in persons or running a prostitution business, spying, treason, or sabotage, commercial bribery, counterfeiting, forgery, or trafficking in vehicles, failure to appear in court on a felony charge for which a sentence of two years in prison may be imposed, alien smuggling, and obstruction of justice, perjury, or bribery of a witness, if the term of imprisonment was at least one year. Notably, precedent holds that driving under the influence is an aggravated felony.

MPI estimates that about 13 percent of unauthorized immigrants in the United States would be considered enforcement priorities under these policies, compared to 27 percent under the 2010-11 enforcement guidelines. The net effect of this new guidance will likely be a reduction in deportations from within the interior of the United States as DHS detention and deportation resources are increasingly allocated to more explicitly defined priorities. By comparing the new enforcement priorities to earlier DHS removal data, this report estimates that the 2014 policy guidance, if strictly adhered to, is likely to reduce deportations from within the United States by about 25,000 cases annually—bringing interior removals below the 100,000 mark. Removals at the U.S.-Mexico border remain a top priority under the 2014 guidelines, so falling interior removals may be offset to some extent by increases at the border."</p>

<p><a id="138" name="138"><sup>138</sup></a> A history of few consequences is the story of immigration enforcement. The following GAO study and news articles provide a perspective that, even though authored years apart, tell the same story. Absent enforcement and violation of immigration laws without consequences invites more illegal immigration and encourages terrorist entry. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229/http://archive.gao.gov/f0302/140072.pdf" target="_blank">"Immigration Control: Deporting and Excluding Aliens from the United States"</a>, GAO/GGD-90-18, U.S. General Accounting Office, October 1989, pp. 22 and 31. Stated the GAO: "Aliens who are released from INS custody pending their deportation hearings frequently have not appeared at their deportation hearings. ... [G]iven that aliens generally have not suffered negative repercussions for failing to appear, other than forfeiture of their bonds, and given that INS has not vigorously pursued reapprehension of those aliens, there seems to be little incentive for aliens facing deportation to appear at hearings… Aliens have nothing to lose by failing to appear for hearings and, in effect, ignoring the deportation process. For example, if they are reapprehended the deportation process continues where it was interrupted. While they are still subject to deportation, no sanctions are imposed. Further, the additional time aliens may have accumulated in the country by avoiding deportation proceedings may support their requests for relief from deportation because of their good conduct while they were here. Failure to appear does not jeopardize their claim of good conduct when applying for relief. By avoiding the deportation process, aliens prolong their stay in the United States. This affords them the opportunity to establish roots in the community and undertake positive and beneficial activities that can be used to support claims for relief from deportation should they be reapprehended Aliens who post bond and fail to appear can forfeit the money or other collateral used to secure their bonds. However, such costs could be viewed as a cost of remaining in the United States. Moreover, many aliens are released on their own recognizance or are not taken into custody at all and do not suffer even the forfeiture of their bond."

When questioned on whether the border had gotten more secure in recent years, he stated, 'It's actually gotten less secure. We're lucky to catch 45 percent of what crosses.' Cabrera added, '[Y]ou're constantly hearing from the administration that it's secure, so the resources aren't being sent where it needs to be. We're having to catch and release program, where people are let into the country pending a court date, and you never see them again, coupled with the fact that it's extremely porous large stretches of our border being left unsecured, unmanned, and it's just a recipe for disaster.' Between 2005 and 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service, the Department of Homeland Security used a measure called 'operational control' to describe the stretches of border it had secured. 'Operational control describes the number of border miles where the Border Patrol can detect, identify, respond to, and interdict cross-border unauthorized activity,' CRS said in a report published last month. 'In February 2010, the Border Patrol reported that 1,107 miles (57 percent) of the Southwest border were under operational control."

Wrote the author: "That means [the] government, according to the Border Patrol, did not have operational control of 43 percent — or approximately 826 miles—of our southern border. By failing to secure the border, the federal government not only allows foreign nationals to come here illegally to live and work, but also provides an avenue for deadly drugs, for the criminals who bring them and for potential terrorists…The failure to secure our southern border harms American workers whose jobs are put at risk and whose wages are suppressed by competition with immigrant workers here illegally. It also harms Americans who become addicted to deadly drugs smuggled across the border, and it harms American communities where those drugs are distributed. 'Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group can challenge them in the near term,' the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said in its 2015 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary."</p>

The <i>Dallas Morning News</i> cited Baird's statement describing the absentee rate that day as 'highly unusual' — so high that he reset the hearings for August 11 rather than possibly issuing a deportation order. Baird said he was concerned that the children may not have received proper notice of the hearings from the federal government. Attorney Lynn Javier of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security agreed that it was 'prudent' to reset the hearings, the Dallas paper reported. Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee studying the illegal immigration crisis on July 9, Juan Osuna, director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Department of Justice, said that about 46 percent of all children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, who are apprehended by authorities fail to show up for hearings before immigration judges.

Most of this research examines the recidivism rates of offenders sentenced to probation or released on parole or compares recidivism rates of offenders assigned to different levels of supervision (Turner and Petersilia, 1992) or different types of treatment (Hepburn and Albonetti, 1994; Kruttschnitt et al., 2000). One of the most influential of these studies was an analysis of recidivism among adult felony offenders placed on probation in Los Angeles and Alameda (California) counties (Petersilia et al., 1985). The authors of this study reported that recidivism rates among probationers were high: 65% were arrested and 51% were charged and convicted during the 40-month follow-up period. Moreover, 18% of the probationers were convicted of serious violent crimes. These results led Petersilia and her colleagues (1985:45) to conclude that 'felony probation has been a high-risk gamble' and to suggest that judges consider alternatives to incarceration other than routine probation."

From fiscal years 2003 through 2009, the number of SCAAP (State Criminal Alien Assistance Program) criminal alien incarcerations in state prison systems and local jails increased from about 220,000 in fiscal year 2003 to about 296,000 in fiscal year 2009. Specifically, the number of SCAAP criminal alien incarcerations in state prison systems increased by about 25 percent and the number of SCAAP criminal alien incarcerations in local jails increased by about 40 percent." In 2009, criminal aliens comprised 31 percent of the state and local prison population. See Figure 3, p. 10. Author's Note: Illegal aliens made up 4 percent of the U.S. population in 2009 and made up about 3.5 percent of the U.S. population in 2012. See Jeffrey S. Passell and D'Vera Cohn, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229/http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/11/18/unauthorized-immigrant-totals-rise-in-7-states-fall-in-14/" target="_blank">"Unauthorized Immigrant Totals Rise in 7 States, Fall in 14"</a>, Pew Research Center, November 18, 2014.</p>
<p><a id="153" name="153"><sup>153</sup></a> Maria Sacchetti, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229/https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/06/04/criminal-immigrants-reoffend-higher-rates-than-ice-has-suggested/l0OpCWfTdCuTNLIAfxApAO/story.html" target="_blank">"Criminal Immigrants Reoffend at Higher Rates Than ICE Has Suggested"</a>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, June 4, 2016. States the article: "They were among the nation's top priorities for deportation, criminals who were supposed to be sent back to their home countries. But instead they were released, one by one, in secret across the United States. Federal officials said that many of the criminals posed little threat to the public, but did little to verify whether that was true. It wasn't. A Boston Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation — a rate that is markedly higher than Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have suggested to Congress in the past. The names of these criminals have never before been made public and are coming to light now only because the Globe sued the federal government for the list of [those] criminals immigration authorities returned to neighborhoods across the country. A judge ordered the names released in 2013, and the Globe then undertook the work that the federal government didn't, scouring court records to find out how many released criminals reoffended."</p>
<p><a id="154" name="154"><sup>154</sup></a> Michael P. Botticelli, director of national drug control policy, Caucus on International Narcotics Control, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229/https://www.drugcaucus.senate.gov/content/drug-trafficking-across-southwest-border-and-oversight-us-counterdrug-assistance-mexico" target="_blank">"Drug Trafficking Across the Southwest Border and Oversight of U.S. Counterdrug Assistance to Mexico"</a>, statement before the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, United States Senate, November 17, 2015. Stated Botticelli: "Opium and heroin production has substantially increased in Mexico in recent years. Heroin seizures along the Southwest border increased sharply (296%) from 2008 to 2013, suggesting a substantial increase in the amount of heroin entering the United States. In 2014, an estimated 42 pure metric tons of heroin were produced in Mexico, up from over 26 pure metric tons in 2013. This compares to a combined estimate of about four metric tons from Colombia and Guatemala…[A] very large proportion of the heroin seized entering the United States comes from Mexico. The increased role of heroin manufacturers and traffickers in Mexico is altering previously established trafficking patterns. As more heroin enters the United States through the Southwest border, the western states have increasingly significant roles as heroin transit areas. DEA and local law enforcement reports from several western states indicate that heroin is entering the United States across the Southwest border in greater volume." See also Jessica Vaughan, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20191217083229/https://cis.org/Testimony/vaughan-another-surge-southwest-border" target="_blank">"Another Surge of Illegal Immigrants along the Southwest Border: Is This the Obama Administration's New Normal?"</a> statement before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, February 4, 2016. Testified Vaughan: "According to Border Patrol statistics, since 2012 agents have apprehended 125,306 Central American unaccompanied minors (UACs). Since 2013, agents have taken 112,237 Central American family units into custody. Together, these add up to 237,543 new illegal arrivals from Central America over the southern land border. Roughly half of these arrived in FY2014. Nearly all were released into the country under the Obama administration's controversial interpretation of sections of the immigration law that are intended to protect victims of trafficking and persecution. After slowing down in 2015, the number of new family and minor arrivals has ticked upward in recent months, with 21,469 new family members and 17,370 new minors arriving during the first three months of FY 2016. The number of illegal minor arrivals has increased 117 percent over last year, and the number of new illegal family arrivals has increased 187 percent over last year."</p>
<p><a id="155" name="155"><sup>155</sup></a> The courts understated the FTA rate in 2015 the way they always have over the previous 19 years. They compared those aliens who failed to appear in court (38,229) to all aliens free before trial (88,868) and all aliens who were detained before trial (50,180). Thus, to get the lower FTA rate of 27 percent the courts compared the 38,229 aliens who no-showed to the 139,048 aliens combined from those who were free pending trial plus those in detention (38,229 ÷ 139,048 = 27 percent). Comparing aliens who failed to appear in court to all aliens free pending court, 38,229 ÷ 88,868 = 43 percent, produces the accurate measure of failure to appear.

This population was the same for President George W. Bush in 2005.</p>
