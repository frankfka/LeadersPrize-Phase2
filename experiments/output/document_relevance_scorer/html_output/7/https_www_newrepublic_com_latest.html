Nowadays, the federal guidelines requiring \u201ctribal consultation\u201d with any local tribal nations are just <a href=\"/article/155209/next-standing-rock-everywhere\">a blanket that the colonizers cover themselves in<\/a>, an&nbsp;often ignored box to be checked so that private companies can legally claim to have done their due diligence as they plow or drill through a grave site.

His team has also taken on Sanders\u2019s claim that health care costs lead to 500,000 bankruptcies a year, going so far as to fact-check the study where Sanders found that statistic.

In September, PolitiFact, the venerable fact-checking operation run by the nonprofit Poynter Institute, waded into a fight between Julian Castro and Joe Biden over their health care plans, and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-attack-joe-bidens-health-plan-falls-/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">found<\/a> a disputable but eminently supportable claim Castro has made\u2014that there is a \u201cbig difference\u201d between a plan people are automatically enrolled in and one they opt into\u2014to be \u201cmostly false.\u201d When Elizabeth Warren blamed trade policy for American job losses, an Associated Press fact check <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7cf3f5fabe1147098354d02396bd1817?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=APFactCheck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said<\/a>, \u201cEconomists mostly blame those job losses on automation and robots, not trade deals.\u201d <em>Some<\/em> economists have indeed made that claim, but others <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-zombie-robot-argument-lurches-on-there-is-no-evidence-that-automation-leads-to-joblessness-or-inequality/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">vehemently disagree<\/a>\u2014pointing out that very little, if any, evidence exists to support the automation thesis.

People holding that job were not responsible for determining whether a magazine story was true (i.e., <em>is<\/em> campus political correctness a threat to liberal democracy?) but whether the discrete statements of fact within it were true (i.e., <em>did<\/em> the College Republicans event with Tommy Robinson happen on this date?). As for determining \u201ctruth,\u201d at least for the purposes of feature writing, Aristotle nailed it: \u201cTo say of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, is true.\u201d <\/p><p>When our current titans of fact-checking were founded, they seemed determined to practice their craft with Aristotelian restraint. The industry was born in the George W. Bush era\u2014FactCheck.org dates back to 2003, PolitiFact to 2007\u2014and their style (including the cutesy lingo) reflects an era in which the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Center\u2019s official version of reality suddenly had to compete with Glenn Beck\u2019s. Like their magazine counterparts, these fact-checkers would only check that a statement was technically true. If, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/09/alqaida.afghanistan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">for example<\/a>, a journalist quoted (accurately) an unreliable source who claimed that Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi government had ties to Al Qaeda, and an administration official cited (accurately) the journalist\u2019s work to support military intervention, the hands of every fact-checker involved in the production and distribution of this untruth would be tied. <\/p><p>Ironically, had fact-checkers kept to this narrow interpretation of the facts, they might actually be useful today. Trump deals less in shifty evasions and omissions than he does in clear falsehoods. While some of his claims can be hard to verify, the just-the-facts approach will catch most of his \u201cwhoppers\u201d (to use a highly technical fact-checking term). <\/p><p>The trouble is, fact-checkers have expanded their purview from checking strictly empirical statements to \u201cchecking\u201d contestable political statements.

In September, PolitiFact, the venerable fact-checking operation run by the nonprofit Poynter Institute, waded into a fight between Julian Castro and Joe Biden over their health care plans, and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/sep/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-attack-joe-bidens-health-plan-falls-/\">found<\/a> a disputable but eminently supportable claim Castro has made\u2014that there is a \u201cbig difference\u201d between a plan people are automatically enrolled in and one they opt into\u2014to be \u201cmostly false.\u201d When Elizabeth Warren blamed trade policy for American job losses, an Associated Press fact check <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7cf3f5fabe1147098354d02396bd1817?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=APFactCheck\">said<\/a>, \u201cEconomists mostly blame those job losses on automation and robots, not trade deals.\u201d <em>Some<\/em> economists have indeed made that claim, but others <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/the-zombie-robot-argument-lurches-on-there-is-no-evidence-that-automation-leads-to-joblessness-or-inequality/\">vehemently disagree<\/a>\u2014pointing out that very little, if any, evidence exists to support the automation thesis.

People holding that job were not responsible for determining whether a magazine story was true (i.e., <em>is<\/em> campus political correctness a threat to liberal democracy?) but whether the discrete statements of fact within it were true (i.e., <em>did<\/em> the College Republicans event with Tommy Robinson happen on this date?). As for determining \u201ctruth,\u201d at least for the purposes of feature writing, Aristotle nailed it: \u201cTo say of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, is true.\u201d <\/p><p>When our current titans of fact-checking were founded, they seemed determined to practice their craft with Aristotelian restraint. The industry was born in the George W. Bush era\u2014FactCheck.org dates back to 2003, PolitiFact to 2007\u2014and their style (including the cutesy lingo) reflects an era in which the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Center\u2019s official version of reality suddenly had to compete with Glenn Beck\u2019s. Like their magazine counterparts, these fact-checkers would only check that a statement was technically true. If, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/09/alqaida.afghanistan\">for example<\/a>, a journalist quoted (accurately) an unreliable source who claimed that Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi government had ties to Al Qaeda, and an administration official cited (accurately) the journalist\u2019s work to support military intervention, the hands of every fact-checker involved in the production and distribution of this untruth would be tied. <\/p><p>Ironically, had fact-checkers kept to this narrow interpretation of the facts, they might actually be useful today. Trump deals less in shifty evasions and omissions than he does in clear falsehoods. While some of his claims can be hard to verify, the just-the-facts approach will catch most of his \u201cwhoppers\u201d (to use a highly technical fact-checking term). <\/p><p>The trouble is, fact-checkers have expanded their purview from checking strictly empirical statements to \u201cchecking\u201d contestable political statements.

Ominously, we were ushered into the new year on Friday with the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, a move that prompted an Iranian counterattack on Tuesday evening. Briefly on Monday, it seemed Soleimani\u2019s killing had also set in motion a true end to the war in Iraq\u2014a letter notifying the Iraqi government that American troops would be withdrawn from the country materialized but was soon disavowed by American officials, who said it had been released by mistake. The shock of the past several days was captured by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes that night:<\/p><blockquote><p><span>A lot of truly horrible things have happened under Donald Trump as president. Nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans died in Puerto Rico after the administration\u2019s weak hurricane response. Thousands of immigrant children separated from their parents kept in cages; dozens of immigrants, including children, have died in ICE custody. But a brand-new war run by this corrupt, incurious president, that is the ultimate fear. A fear that looks very close right now to being a reality. In the wake of his ordering the airstrike of the number two figure in Iran, millions of people marching the streets in Iran, Trump is now tweeting the way he always tweets, making outrageous declarations and threats. But now the difference is this. The stakes are as high as they can possibly be.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>The stakes are indeed high, but for all the anxieties and uncertainties of this moment in the Trump presidency, it should be said that we already know, or ought to know, where many of the situations we face came from and where they are likely to lead. The Senate\u2019s impeachment trial, whenever and however it begins, will end with Trump\u2019s acquittal, an outcome guaranteed by the Constitution\u2019s supermajority requirement for conviction and Trump\u2019s durable popularity within the Republican Party\u2014which would imperil any Republican Senator voting against him, assuming, optimistically, there were a meaningful number willing to do so on the merits of the case to begin with.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The matters to which Hayes referred were, even if not fully predictable, certainly prefigured. The Trump administration\u2019s shoddy response to Hurricane Maria parallels the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina as a reminder of what can befall nonwhite Americans who live at the periphery of our national attention. It was also a reminder, for those open to one, of Puerto Rico\u2019s subjugated status, a legacy of colonial aspirations reinforced by policies like Promesa, the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to force fiscal austerity on the territory at the hands of unelected administrators. Trump\u2019s immigration policies immediately followed, and were partially informed by, the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to deport millions of the undocumented, which also broke up untold numbers of families.<\/span><\/p><p><span>Trump\u2019s assassination of Soleimani, of course, has its own antecedents. War with Iran has long been feared because it has long been plausible, an outcome that, even if it occurs at Trump\u2019s direction, will have been set in motion by decades of American foreign policy. To the extent that Trump has discernible objectives with Iran, they are the very same goals that have guided our relations with the country for years\u2014preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power and further challenging American interests. Hawks and most doves alike would like to see events in the region proceed in a direction maximally convenient for the United States, which makes economic, diplomatic, and military interventions inevitable.<\/span><\/p><p><span>It is notable that most mainstream criticisms of Soleimani\u2019s assassination have been centered around questions of strategy\u2014the wisdom of taking out a monster the way Trump did at the time he chose to do it. The questions of prerogative have been all but settled, the last administration having already established that the U.S. can summarily kill almost anyone abroad that the president considers sufficiently dangerous, up to and including American citizens. Similarly, while Trump\u2019s threat to bomb cultural sites in Iran has been denounced widely, easily, and rightfully as a threat to commit war crimes prohibited by international law, that phrase has only ever been fitfully applied to our torture and abuse of military detainees or our efforts to materially aid Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing slaughters of civilians in Yemen. There has long been bipartisan ambivalence, overall, about the legal limits of American military activity and aid, and the present tensions have been crafted not only by Trump but by members of the American political establishment. This is why it was unsurprising to hear, as <\/span><i>The New York Times<\/i><span> has reported, that the killing of Soleimani was pushed aggressively by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014two men who were fairly ordinary Republicans before the Trump administration and will be ordinary Republicans again when it ends.<\/span><\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself.<\/aside><p><span>The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself. Pence\u2019s dishonest invocation of 9/11 in defense of the assassination, for instance\u2014the Vice President falsely claimed in a tweet that Soleimani had helped the hijackers travel to Afghanistan\u2014echoes for many the period before the Iraq War, when toppling Saddam Hussein was justified on similar grounds, and enthusiasm for a large, meaningful conflict wholly eclipsed skepticism and reason. But it is estimated by military experts that it would take about <\/span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/8/18693297/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.6 million troops<\/a><span> to capture Tehran\u2014a number that outstrips our current military capacity and could well demand the conscription that was the subject of perhaps thousands of half-ironic social media posts in the immediate wake of Soleimani\u2019s death. This is a political impossibility. In the wake of 9/11, the Bush administration held far more credibility among the American public than Trump holds now\u2014more, in fact, than any president is likely to hold again in the near future given the deepening of partisan polarization. Iraq-style regime change seems less likely than an ongoing tit-for-tat. This would certainly be risky for American troops but, as has been the case for decades, far riskier for civilians in the region who will suffer and die just outside the corner of the public eye.<\/span><\/p><p><span>To anticipate something more cataclysmic for Americans here\u2014such as World War III, as some breathlessly speculated over the weekend\u2014is to believe that the presidency of Donald Trump, and his election in 2016, have brought us into a world of chaotic possibility, a world where the unlikely ought to be expected here and abroad. Much has happened over the past few years to reinforce this impression\u2014from Trump\u2019s unpredictable ravings on social media and at his rallies, to the outbursts of political violence in 2017 and 2018. <\/span><\/p><p><span>But we can, and should, think about the Trump era in a different way\u2014we should understand that cruelties and catastrophes that appear senseless have been made possible by long-standing conditions and factors which have accrued over time. This is one of the central divides in American political thought today\u2014the gulf between those who believe Donald Trump is an agent of chaos and those who believe Donald Trump is an agent of history, pulling us further down a path already laid by previous action, our political institutions, and stratifying power dynamics, including class oppression, white supremacy, and sexism. The latter view has been memefied as the \u201cbig structural change\u201d perspective on the 2020 campaign trail, but its implications are more profound.<\/span><\/p><p><span>For instance, the endless and often tiresome contretemps over the 1619 Project\u2014last year\u2019s examination of slavery\u2019s centrality to the American story in <\/span><i>The New York Times Magazine<\/i><span>\u2014is essentially reducible to a disagreement over whether our country is defined by a set of founding ideals, now and then betrayed or undermined by bad actors, or by a set of structural forces that have materially shaped our political and societal outcomes. The idealist spirit, which once drove the <\/span><i>Times<\/i><span>\u2019 David Brooks to criticize Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 writing on race for \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/opinion/listening-to-ta-nehisi-coates-while-white.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">excessive realism<\/a><span>\u201d\u2014an extraordinarily telling phrase\u2014typically prevails in American politics for reasons that are often chalked up to the complexity of structural and historical analyses and the public\u2019s lack of civic education.<\/span><\/p><p><span>But the critiques politicians receive whenever they do try to get the public to dig deeper also matter. On Monday, <\/span><i>New York <\/i>magazine<span> ran a profile of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that contained this fairly innocuous passage:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p><span>I asked her what she thought her role would be as a member of Congress during, for instance, a Joe Biden presidency. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said with a groan. \u201cIn any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party, but in America, we are.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p>In democracies across the globe, left-wing politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and politicians closer to the center like Biden do, in fact, often find themselves in different parties. The coalitions that make up the two major American parties are, by comparison, relatively broad, owing in large part to the design of our particular system. But Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark was taken by some as a petty and purely personal slight against Joe Biden and others in the party. Democratic Congressman Ben McAdams, for instance, tweeted that she had offered an example \u201cof why people can\u2019t stand Washington.\u201d <\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left figure-active\">We are always far more interested in the personalities of particular people than we are in the ground under all of our feet.<\/aside><p>These were reactions born of a political discourse that centers individual virtue and conscious agency, a dynamic that has influenced everything from the remarkable argument, earlier in the primary, over the propriety of mildly criticizing the Obama administration from the Democratic debate stage, to the perennial conversations about whether it is fair to ascribe racism or prejudice to those who support racist or prejudiced policies without clear evidence of personal hatred.

Ominously, we were ushered into the new year on Friday with the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, a move that prompted an Iranian counterattack on Tuesday evening. Briefly on Monday, it seemed Soleimani\u2019s killing had also set in motion a true end to the war in Iraq\u2014a letter notifying the Iraqi government that American troops would be withdrawn from the country materialized but was soon disavowed by American officials, who said it had been released by mistake. The shock of the past several days was captured by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes that night:<\/p><blockquote><p><span>A lot of truly horrible things have happened under Donald Trump as president. Nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans died in Puerto Rico after the administration\u2019s weak hurricane response. Thousands of immigrant children separated from their parents kept in cages; dozens of immigrants, including children, have died in ICE custody. But a brand-new war run by this corrupt, incurious president, that is the ultimate fear. A fear that looks very close right now to being a reality. In the wake of his ordering the airstrike of the number two figure in Iran, millions of people marching the streets in Iran, Trump is now tweeting the way he always tweets, making outrageous declarations and threats. But now the difference is this. The stakes are as high as they can possibly be.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>The stakes are indeed high, but for all the anxieties and uncertainties of this moment in the Trump presidency, it should be said that we already know, or ought to know, where many of the situations we face came from and where they are likely to lead. The Senate\u2019s impeachment trial, whenever and however it begins, will end with Trump\u2019s acquittal, an outcome guaranteed by the Constitution\u2019s supermajority requirement for conviction and Trump\u2019s durable popularity within the Republican Party\u2014which would imperil any Republican Senator voting against him, assuming, optimistically, there were a meaningful number willing to do so on the merits of the case to begin with.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The matters to which Hayes referred were, even if not fully predictable, certainly prefigured. The Trump administration\u2019s shoddy response to Hurricane Maria parallels the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina as a reminder of what can befall nonwhite Americans who live at the periphery of our national attention. It was also a reminder, for those open to one, of Puerto Rico\u2019s subjugated status, a legacy of colonial aspirations reinforced by policies like Promesa, the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to force fiscal austerity on the territory at the hands of unelected administrators. Trump\u2019s immigration policies immediately followed, and were partially informed by, the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to deport millions of the undocumented, which also broke up untold numbers of families.<\/span><\/p><p><span>Trump\u2019s assassination of Soleimani, of course, has its own antecedents. War with Iran has long been feared because it has long been plausible, an outcome that, even if it occurs at Trump\u2019s direction, will have been set in motion by decades of American foreign policy. To the extent that Trump has discernible objectives with Iran, they are the very same goals that have guided our relations with the country for years\u2014preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power and further challenging American interests. Hawks and most doves alike would like to see events in the region proceed in a direction maximally convenient for the United States, which makes economic, diplomatic, and military interventions inevitable.<\/span><\/p><p><span>It is notable that most mainstream criticisms of Soleimani\u2019s assassination have been centered around questions of strategy\u2014the wisdom of taking out a monster the way Trump did at the time he chose to do it. The questions of prerogative have been all but settled, the last administration having already established that the U.S. can summarily kill almost anyone abroad that the president considers sufficiently dangerous, up to and including American citizens. Similarly, while Trump\u2019s threat to bomb cultural sites in Iran has been denounced widely, easily, and rightfully as a threat to commit war crimes prohibited by international law, that phrase has only ever been fitfully applied to our torture and abuse of military detainees or our efforts to materially aid Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing slaughters of civilians in Yemen. There has long been bipartisan ambivalence, overall, about the legal limits of American military activity and aid, and the present tensions have been crafted not only by Trump but by members of the American political establishment. This is why it was unsurprising to hear, as <\/span><i>The New York Times<\/i><span> has reported, that the killing of Soleimani was pushed aggressively by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014two men who were fairly ordinary Republicans before the Trump administration and will be ordinary Republicans again when it ends.<\/span><\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself.<\/aside><p><span>The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself. Pence\u2019s dishonest invocation of 9/11 in defense of the assassination, for instance\u2014the Vice President falsely claimed in a tweet that Soleimani had helped the hijackers travel to Afghanistan\u2014echoes for many the period before the Iraq War, when toppling Saddam Hussein was justified on similar grounds, and enthusiasm for a large, meaningful conflict wholly eclipsed skepticism and reason. But it is estimated by military experts that it would take about <\/span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/8/18693297/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq\">1.6 million troops<\/a><span> to capture Tehran\u2014a number that outstrips our current military capacity and could well demand the conscription that was the subject of perhaps thousands of half-ironic social media posts in the immediate wake of Soleimani\u2019s death. This is a political impossibility. In the wake of 9/11, the Bush administration held far more credibility among the American public than Trump holds now\u2014more, in fact, than any president is likely to hold again in the near future given the deepening of partisan polarization. Iraq-style regime change seems less likely than an ongoing tit-for-tat. This would certainly be risky for American troops but, as has been the case for decades, far riskier for civilians in the region who will suffer and die just outside the corner of the public eye.<\/span><\/p><p><span>To anticipate something more cataclysmic for Americans here\u2014such as World War III, as some breathlessly speculated over the weekend\u2014is to believe that the presidency of Donald Trump, and his election in 2016, have brought us into a world of chaotic possibility, a world where the unlikely ought to be expected here and abroad. Much has happened over the past few years to reinforce this impression\u2014from Trump\u2019s unpredictable ravings on social media and at his rallies, to the outbursts of political violence in 2017 and 2018. <\/span><\/p><p><span>But we can, and should, think about the Trump era in a different way\u2014we should understand that cruelties and catastrophes that appear senseless have been made possible by long-standing conditions and factors which have accrued over time. This is one of the central divides in American political thought today\u2014the gulf between those who believe Donald Trump is an agent of chaos and those who believe Donald Trump is an agent of history, pulling us further down a path already laid by previous action, our political institutions, and stratifying power dynamics, including class oppression, white supremacy, and sexism. The latter view has been memefied as the \u201cbig structural change\u201d perspective on the 2020 campaign trail, but its implications are more profound.<\/span><\/p><p><span>For instance, the endless and often tiresome contretemps over the 1619 Project\u2014last year\u2019s examination of slavery\u2019s centrality to the American story in <\/span><i>The New York Times Magazine<\/i><span>\u2014is essentially reducible to a disagreement over whether our country is defined by a set of founding ideals, now and then betrayed or undermined by bad actors, or by a set of structural forces that have materially shaped our political and societal outcomes. The idealist spirit, which once drove the <\/span><i>Times<\/i><span>\u2019 David Brooks to criticize Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019 writing on race for \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/opinion/listening-to-ta-nehisi-coates-while-white.html\">excessive realism<\/a><span>\u201d\u2014an extraordinarily telling phrase\u2014typically prevails in American politics for reasons that are often chalked up to the complexity of structural and historical analyses and the public\u2019s lack of civic education.<\/span><\/p><p><span>But the critiques politicians receive whenever they do try to get the public to dig deeper also matter. On Monday, <\/span><i>New York <\/i>magazine<span> ran a profile of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that contained this fairly innocuous passage:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p><span>I asked her what she thought her role would be as a member of Congress during, for instance, a Joe Biden presidency. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said with a groan. \u201cIn any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party, but in America, we are.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p>In democracies across the globe, left-wing politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and politicians closer to the center like Biden do, in fact, often find themselves in different parties. The coalitions that make up the two major American parties are, by comparison, relatively broad, owing in large part to the design of our particular system. But Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark was taken by some as a petty and purely personal slight against Joe Biden and others in the party. Democratic Congressman Ben McAdams, for instance, tweeted that she had offered an example \u201cof why people can\u2019t stand Washington.\u201d <\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left figure-active\">We are always far more interested in the personalities of particular people than we are in the ground under all of our feet.<\/aside><p>These were reactions born of a political discourse that centers individual virtue and conscious agency, a dynamic that has influenced everything from the remarkable argument, earlier in the primary, over the propriety of mildly criticizing the Obama administration from the Democratic debate stage, to the perennial conversations about whether it is fair to ascribe racism or prejudice to those who support racist or prejudiced policies without clear evidence of personal hatred. We are always far more interested in the personalities of particular people than we are in the ground under all of our feet. <\/p><p>This makes it easy for many to view Trump, himself, as the locus of all that ails America and his election as an extraordinary event. That is the perception currently sustaining Biden\u2019s candidacy for the Democratic nomination.

Reporting from <i>The Washington Post <\/i>and others revealed that the strike on Soleimani was <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/how-trump-decided-to-kill-a-top-iranian-general/2020/01/03/77ce3cc4-2e62-11ea-bcd4-24597950008f_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">never seriously considered<\/a> by the military until Trump ordered it\u2014it had been put on a menu of retaliatory options to make more effective, less incendiary options seem more palatable. <\/p><p><span>The drone strike at Baghdad airport was selected, in other words, because Trump, a jumble of contradictory impulses and a man with no head for strategy, will almost always pick the most bombastic option, particularly when he\u2019s in need of a quick distraction from domestic troubles. <\/span><br><\/p><p>And yet there has been plenty of speculation about the strategic significance of Soleimani\u2019s killing. The administration quickly offered its own rationale. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested, without evidence, that the Iranian general, who was responsible for Iran\u2019s proxy wars throughout the Middle East and had helped spearhead the country\u2019s strategy to keep war-torn Iraq as a vassal state, was taken out because he was planning <a href=\"https://hillreporter.com/pompeo-offers-little-evidence-of-imminent-threats-from-iran-in-tuesday-press-briefing-55115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cimminent attacks\u201d<\/a> against Americans.

Others added their own \u201canalysis\u201d of the president\u2019s rash decision, which was perceived by Iran to be a naked act of war. \u201cThe calculus was straightforward,\u201d David Sanger <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/world/middleeast/trump-iran-suleimani.html#click=https://t.co/D6AF7Bn8u9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote<\/a> in <i>The New York Times <\/i><span>over the weekend. \u201cWashington had to re-establish deterrence, and show the Iranian leadership that missiles fired at ships in the Persian Gulf and at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, along with attacks inside Iraq that cost the life of an American contractor, would not go without a response.\u201d <\/span><\/p><p>But the idea that Trump was guided by some geopolitical rationale is plainly absurd. Yes, Soleimani can be tied to the deaths of American soldiers, but the suggestion that he was plotting some sinister escalation\u2014that he had to be removed immediately to save lives, <i>24<\/i>-style\u2014simply doesn\u2019t track. As the <i>Times<\/i> later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported<\/a>, citing a U.S. official, the evidence that Soleimaini was planning some new attack was \u201cthin.\u201d<\/p><p>Indeed, none of the White House\u2019s stated or presumed foreign policy goals make any sense, giving the distinct impression there weren\u2019t any in the first place. Instead of stopping Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, the Trump administration has accelerated that possibility. Instead of securing greater influence in the Middle East, it has likely lost it, particularly in Iraq, which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/middleeast/iraq-us-troops-explainer-intl/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">voted<\/a> to expel U.S. troops on Monday. Instead of reestablishing deterrence, it has invited more attacks, if not outright war. And instead of shaking the Iranian regime, it has seemingly united Iran, which only weeks ago was wracked by popular protests, in mourning and anger. Trump\u2019s likely actual rationales\u2014uniting the Republican Party, distracting from impeachment, winning reelection\u2014are all domestic in nature. <br><\/p><p><span>What the Iran coverage shows is that the mainstream media\u2019s biggest liability remains its credulous approach to an administration with zero credibility. Given Trump\u2019s track record\u2014and his <\/span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/3/21048079/trump-pompeo-iran-lies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thousands of lies<\/a><span> as president\u2014there is simply no reason to take anything that he says at face value. The Bush administration at least dressed up its lies with theater, with Colin Powell at the United Nations; the Trump administration has offered nothing to support its claim that \u201cimminent\u201d attacks against Americans were being planned, or that killing Soleimani was the only way to prevent these attacks, or that hitting Iran\u2019s top general with a missile was meant to forestall a war with Iran. <\/span><br><\/p><p><span>The media\u2019s lackluster coverage of Soleimani\u2019s death has been abetted by the Democratic Party\u2019s response to it. Rather than forcefully calling out his targeted assassination as a violation of international law that puts the country at risk of another war in the Middle East, most Democrats have issued <\/span><a href=\"/article/156119/democrats-gutless-response-trumps-air-strike\">gutless, mealy-mouthed statements<\/a><span> that bolster the administration\u2019s central claim: that Soleimani was a baddie who had it coming. The Democrats\u2014still petrified of being seen as soft on national security, still beholden to D.C.\u2019s foreign policy blob\u2014are adding undeserved credibility to his assassination. <\/span><br><\/p><p>They\u2019re also robbing the media of its principal fuel, partisan conflict. Because outlets like the <i>Times<\/i> are uncomfortable calling out lies, they rely on political figures to do so for them. But Democrats, with the notable <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/887323/how-bernie-sanders-response-soleimani-strike-stands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">exception<\/a> of Bernie Sanders, have largely offered condemnations of Trump that have been weakened by being couched in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sethmoulton/status/1212938094762188801\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">condemnations of Soleimani<\/a>. As a result, the administration\u2019s manipulations are given center stage. <br><\/p><p><span>There is always a temptation to ascribe a deep, unspoken strategy to Trump\u2019s improvised approach to politics\u2014to find order in the chaos, a signal in the noise. But all of the available evidence suggests that there is no plan at all, that Trump is a deeply incompetent liar who has no idea what he is doing and no respect for the few people around him who do. If there is war with Iran, it will be because of Trump\u2019s incompetence and lies; if there is not, it will be in spite of these things.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested, without evidence, that the Iranian general, who was responsible for Iran\u2019s proxy wars throughout the Middle East and had helped spearhead the country\u2019s strategy to keep war-torn Iraq as a vassal state, was taken out because he was planning <a href=\"https://hillreporter.com/pompeo-offers-little-evidence-of-imminent-threats-from-iran-in-tuesday-press-briefing-55115\">\u201cimminent attacks\u201d<\/a> against Americans. Trump, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-soleimani-iraq-airstrike-83bed940-b52f-4104-bdf0-c96701bfdb1e.html\">echoing<\/a> this line, said that he ordered the assassination to \u201cstop a war,\u201d adding, \u201cWe did not take action to start a war.\u201d <br><\/p><p>These lines were repeated uncritically by a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-vows-revenge-after-us-drone-strike-kills-elite-force-commander/2020/01/03/345127d6-2df4-11ea-bffe-020c88b3f120_story.html\"> number of news outlets<\/a>. Others added their own \u201canalysis\u201d of the president\u2019s rash decision, which was perceived by Iran to be a naked act of war. \u201cThe calculus was straightforward,\u201d David Sanger <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/world/middleeast/trump-iran-suleimani.html#click=https://t.co/D6AF7Bn8u9\">wrote<\/a> in <i>The New York Times <\/i><span>over the weekend. \u201cWashington had to re-establish deterrence, and show the Iranian leadership that missiles fired at ships in the Persian Gulf and at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, along with attacks inside Iraq that cost the life of an American contractor, would not go without a response.\u201d <\/span><\/p><p>But the idea that Trump was guided by some geopolitical rationale is plainly absurd. Yes, Soleimani can be tied to the deaths of American soldiers, but the suggestion that he was plotting some sinister escalation\u2014that he had to be removed immediately to save lives, <i>24<\/i>-style\u2014simply doesn\u2019t track. As the <i>Times<\/i> later <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/us/politics/trump-suleimani.html\">reported<\/a>, citing a U.S. official, the evidence that Soleimaini was planning some new attack was \u201cthin.\u201d<\/p><p>Indeed, none of the White House\u2019s stated or presumed foreign policy goals make any sense, giving the distinct impression there weren\u2019t any in the first place. Instead of stopping Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, the Trump administration has accelerated that possibility. Instead of securing greater influence in the Middle East, it has likely lost it, particularly in Iraq, which <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/06/middleeast/iraq-us-troops-explainer-intl/index.html\">voted<\/a> to expel U.S. troops on Monday. Instead of reestablishing deterrence, it has invited more attacks, if not outright war. And instead of shaking the Iranian regime, it has seemingly united Iran, which only weeks ago was wracked by popular protests, in mourning and anger. Trump\u2019s likely actual rationales\u2014uniting the Republican Party, distracting from impeachment, winning reelection\u2014are all domestic in nature. <br><\/p><p><span>What the Iran coverage shows is that the mainstream media\u2019s biggest liability remains its credulous approach to an administration with zero credibility. Given Trump\u2019s track record\u2014and his <\/span><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/3/21048079/trump-pompeo-iran-lies\">thousands of lies<\/a><span> as president\u2014there is simply no reason to take anything that he says at face value. The Bush administration at least dressed up its lies with theater, with Colin Powell at the United Nations; the Trump administration has offered nothing to support its claim that \u201cimminent\u201d attacks against Americans were being planned, or that killing Soleimani was the only way to prevent these attacks, or that hitting Iran\u2019s top general with a missile was meant to forestall a war with Iran. <\/span><br><\/p><p><span>The media\u2019s lackluster coverage of Soleimani\u2019s death has been abetted by the Democratic Party\u2019s response to it. Rather than forcefully calling out his targeted assassination as a violation of international law that puts the country at risk of another war in the Middle East, most Democrats have issued <\/span><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156119/democrats-gutless-response-trumps-air-strike\">gutless, mealy-mouthed statements<\/a><span> that bolster the administration\u2019s central claim: that Soleimani was a baddie who had it coming. The Democrats\u2014still petrified of being seen as soft on national security, still beholden to D.C.\u2019s foreign policy blob\u2014are adding undeserved credibility to his assassination. <\/span><br><\/p><p>They\u2019re also robbing the media of its principal fuel, partisan conflict. Because outlets like the <i>Times<\/i> are uncomfortable calling out lies, they rely on political figures to do so for them. But Democrats, with the notable <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/887323/how-bernie-sanders-response-soleimani-strike-stands\">exception<\/a> of Bernie Sanders, have largely offered condemnations of Trump that have been weakened by being couched in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sethmoulton/status/1212938094762188801\">condemnations of Soleimani<\/a>. As a result, the administration\u2019s manipulations are given center stage. <br><\/p><p><span>There is always a temptation to ascribe a deep, unspoken strategy to Trump\u2019s improvised approach to politics\u2014to find order in the chaos, a signal in the noise. But all of the available evidence suggests that there is no plan at all, that Trump is a deeply incompetent liar who has no idea what he is doing and no respect for the few people around him who do. If there is war with Iran, it will be because of Trump\u2019s incompetence and lies; if there is not, it will be in spite of these things. Coverage that attempts to find the hidden meaning behind his actions only obscures what\u2019s really happening. <\/span><br><\/p><p><br><br><br><\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"media-getting-wrong-soleimanis-killing","updatedAt":"2020-01-07T23:03:30.143Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-07T19:46:36.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156144/media-getting-wrong-soleimanis-killing","ledeImageCaption":"Mohammed Sawaf/AFP/Getty Images","galleries":[],"status":"PUBLISHED","meta":{"hideHeader":false,"wordCount":937,"disableAds":false,"hideLede":false},"tags":[{"id":"3046ee55-25d3-43cb-8491-58b17f8004d3","label":"Politics","slug":"politics"},{"id":"59cf7b0a-4212-453e-9750-4c2c187bf500","label":"The Commons","slug":"the-commons"},{"id":"6bfcc676-2945-4226-b5fc-20eec068ca24","label":"Media","slug":"media"},{"id":"01e50038-55ff-4e43-8b0b-fbcf8c47d17d","label":"New York Times","slug":"new-york-times"}],"ledeImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/1bb6189c1d45eb695c8d4ea1a422766a5c0dd07c.jpeg","width":3696,"format":"JPEG","id":"4a8e38c2-c482-4b6a-9e4f-e78a5dc00f73","isAnimated":false,"hash":"1bb6189c1d45eb695c8d4ea1a422766a5c0dd07c","height":2456,"meta":{}},"authors":[{"UserId":"d1f2f3b1-af3d-47f5-8045-64e68cbe3e4c","name":"Alex Shephard","bio":"<p>Alex Shephard is a staff writer at <i>The<\/i> <em>New Republic<\/em>.<\/p>","id":"e61b5030-b42b-4794-913c-2f8b208019ef","title":null,"blurb":"<p>Alex Shephard is a staff writer at <i>The <\/i><em>New Republic<\/em>.<\/p>","slug":"alex-shephard","status":"INACTIVE","meta":{"twitter":"alex_shephard"},"headshotImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/a06b59d5987812d80a023c5513ab30c2e93123db.jpeg","width":235,"format":"JPEG","id":"919f7560-cd43-442a-9879-c9e61751fa3c","isAnimated":false,"hash":"a06b59d5987812d80a023c5513ab30c2e93123db","height":235,"meta":{}}}]},{"sponsor":null,"deck":"As the United States staggers toward war, it will try to draw troops from the same poor, rural neighborhoods it always has.","bylines":null,"nid":156131,"urlFull":"https://newrepublic.com/article/156131/military-views-poor-kids-fodder-forever-wars","title":"The Military Views Poor Kids as Fodder for Its Forever Wars","body":"<p>In my high school in rural North Carolina, a plastic table was set up just off to the side of&nbsp;the atrium&nbsp;where we all&nbsp;congregated after lunch every day.

It\u2019s a\nvibrant, urban neighborhood and, in recent years, the subject of police\ncrackdowns targeting one dense block of massage businesses. That\u2019s where Yang\nSong was arrested after an undercover sting in 2017. Arrests\nof Asian-identified people in New York City charged with <b>\u201c<\/b>both unlicensed\nmassage and prostitution increased by 2,700 percent between 2012 and 2016,<b>\u201d<\/b> according\nto a <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/consequences-policing-prostitution\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">report<\/a>&nbsp;from the Urban Institute and the Legal Aid\nSociety\u2014all during the operation of Serita\u2019s specialized court, where Song then\nappeared.<\/p><p>In their first appearance\nat this court, defendants are typically mandated to a half-dozen or more \u201csessions\u201d\nin a social service program, like Garden of Hope, an anti\u2013domestic violence nonprofit\nthat now also serves victims of human trafficking. Through attending these\nsessions and regularly reporting back to court in further appearances, defendants\nare expected to demonstrate their progress and avoid future arrests. Over\nthe years I have reported on these courts, defendants, their attorneys, and\nsome service providers themselves have each pointed out the bitter irony that\nthe same people the courts regard as victims of a crime are judged as\nrehabilitated based not on their own self-directed goals but on whether police arrest them<i> <\/i>again in the future.<\/p><p>By that\nstandard, would the courts consider Yang Song a success or a failure? Days\nbefore a scheduled court appearance before Serita, the New York Police Department again raided the\nmassage business where Yang Song worked. The police had allegedly called her \u201cJane\nDoe Ponytail.\u201d As officers rushed up the stairs, she fell from the window and to\nthe sidewalk below. Hours later, she was pronounced dead. She was 38 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Yang Song\u2019s death shook the community of and around massage workers in Flushing, including some of the groups involved with the human trafficking courts. \u201cThere are people who we talked to on the street, and they are saying they would rather jump than be arrested,\u201d Susan Liu, associate director of women\u2019s services at Garden of Hope,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theappeal.org/after-deadly-massage-parlor-raid-advocates-say-end-to-prostitution-arrests-is-long-overdue-e61f4aae1bca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said<\/a>&nbsp;the week following Yang Song\u2019s death. Her family would go on to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theappeal.org/family-former-attorney-of-queens-woman-who-fell-to-her-death-in-vice-sting-say-she-was-sexually-d67461a12f1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tell<\/a>&nbsp;my reporting partner, Emma Whitford, and me that she had phoned them once to say she had been sexually assaulted by a man claiming to be an undercover cop. \u201cNo matter why my sister fell from the building,\u201d her brother Hai Song <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/new-evidence-in-the-death-of-a-queens-massage-worker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">told us<\/a>, \u201cthere were always threats and harassment from the police before the accident.\u201d (Months after Song\u2019s death, the Queens District Attorney <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4551645-Yang-Song-Report-Release-06-19-2018.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">found no fault<\/a> with the NYPD.)&nbsp;<\/p><p>The <i>Times<\/i>\ncorrectly notes that the trafficking courts\u2019 fate is tied up in the laws that criminalize sex workers: Without the laws and the ensuing vice enforcement, the\ncourts would have no one to rescue. This is the precise point made for years\nnow by sex workers\u2019 rights advocates, including current and former sex workers,\nfrom RedUP to new groups like Red Canary Song, who formed in the wake of Yang\nSong\u2019s death to organize massage workers in her neighborhood.<\/p><p>\u201cThe issue with\nthe courts is\nthat it incentivizes individuals, whether trafficked or not, to plea to\nprostitution charges in exchange for much-needed services,\u201d said Julie Xu, a volunteer organizer, and Esther K, the director of coalition building at Red Canary Song, in a statement to <i>The New Republic<\/i>. The courts can reinforce\nthe coercion they are supposed to interrupt by making help contingent on pleading\nguilty and by using the threat of arrest or jail time as a tool for compliance.\nOr, as Red Canary Song put it, \u201cCriminalization and the distrust of police is the root cause\nof human trafficking.\u201d<\/p><p><span>Since Yang Song\u2019s death and the resulting outcry from sex workers, their groups have found more political allies\u2014such as former Queens DA candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n,\nwho <\/span><a href=\"/article/154316/tiffany-caban-reshape-criminal-justice-system\">campaigned<\/a><span>\nin part on decriminalizing sex work (which would end the trafficking courts), and New York State Assembly member Ron Kim.

To end the criminalization of sex work, he said, \u201cwould\nplace workers at the center of our policy-making.\u201d That may also ensure prosecutors and judges are\nheld to account by the sex workers they have failed to help<b>, <\/b>all while using the trafficking courts as a platform to reform their own carceral image.<\/p>","type":"LONGFORM","cleanTitle":"Human Trafficking Courts Are Not a Criminal Justice \u201cInnovation\u201d","createdAt":"2020-01-06T20:49:28.952Z","displayAt":null,"ledeCleanImage":null,"lock":null,"id":"e8620d92-0324-4e83-8c72-065e0370199d","bodySource":"<p><span>New York state\u2019s\ncourt system considers its&nbsp;Human Trafficking Intervention Courts\u2014special courts sold as an alternative to jail for women facing prostitution charges\u2014to be a national <\/span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-newyork-prostitution/new-york-creates-state-wide-court-system-to-help-prostitutes-idUSBRE98O14520130925\">model<\/a><span>\nfor <\/span><a href=\"https://www.ovcttac.gov/taskforceguide/eguide/6-the-role-of-courts/64-innovative-court-responses/human-trafficking-courts/\">such\nprograms<\/a><span>.

Arrests\nof Asian-identified people in New York City charged with <b>\u201c<\/b>both unlicensed\nmassage and prostitution increased by 2,700 percent between 2012 and 2016,<b>\u201d<\/b> according\nto a <a href=\"http://www.urban.org/research/publication/consequences-policing-prostitution\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a>&nbsp;from the Urban Institute and the Legal Aid\nSociety\u2014all during the operation of Serita\u2019s specialized court, where Song then\nappeared.<\/p><p>In their first appearance\nat this court, defendants are typically mandated to a half-dozen or more \u201csessions\u201d\nin a social service program, like Garden of Hope, an anti\u2013domestic violence nonprofit\nthat now also serves victims of human trafficking. Through attending these\nsessions and regularly reporting back to court in further appearances, defendants\nare expected to demonstrate their progress and avoid future arrests. Over\nthe years I have reported on these courts, defendants, their attorneys, and\nsome service providers themselves have each pointed out the bitter irony that\nthe same people the courts regard as victims of a crime are judged as\nrehabilitated based not on their own self-directed goals but on whether police arrest them<i> <\/i>again in the future.<\/p><p>By that\nstandard, would the courts consider Yang Song a success or a failure? Days\nbefore a scheduled court appearance before Serita, the New York Police Department again raided the\nmassage business where Yang Song worked. The police had allegedly called her \u201cJane\nDoe Ponytail.\u201d As officers rushed up the stairs, she fell from the window and to\nthe sidewalk below. Hours later, she was pronounced dead. She was 38 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p>Yang Song\u2019s death shook the community of and around massage workers in Flushing, including some of the groups involved with the human trafficking courts. \u201cThere are people who we talked to on the street, and they are saying they would rather jump than be arrested,\u201d Susan Liu, associate director of women\u2019s services at Garden of Hope,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theappeal.org/after-deadly-massage-parlor-raid-advocates-say-end-to-prostitution-arrests-is-long-overdue-e61f4aae1bca/\">said<\/a>&nbsp;the week following Yang Song\u2019s death.

This is the precise point made for years\nnow by sex workers\u2019 rights advocates, including current and former sex workers,\nfrom RedUP to new groups like Red Canary Song, who formed in the wake of Yang\nSong\u2019s death to organize massage workers in her neighborhood.<\/p><p>\u201cThe issue with\nthe courts is\nthat it incentivizes individuals, whether trafficked or not, to plea to\nprostitution charges in exchange for much-needed services,\u201d said Julie Xu, a volunteer organizer, and Esther K, the director of coalition building at Red Canary Song, in a statement to <i>The New Republic<\/i>. The courts can reinforce\nthe coercion they are supposed to interrupt by making help contingent on pleading\nguilty and by using the threat of arrest or jail time as a tool for compliance.\nOr, as Red Canary Song put it, \u201cCriminalization and the distrust of police is the root cause\nof human trafficking.\u201d<\/p><p><span>Since Yang Song\u2019s death and the resulting outcry from sex workers, their groups have found more political allies\u2014such as former Queens DA candidate Tiffany Cab\u00e1n,\nwho <\/span><a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/154316/tiffany-caban-reshape-criminal-justice-system\">campaigned<\/a><span>\nin part on decriminalizing sex work (which would end the trafficking courts), and New York State Assembly member Ron Kim.

By October, still in the belly of the southern\nhemisphere\u2019s spring season, fires to Sydney\u2019s west and south blew out of\ncontrol, and the cloak of a climate change\u2013stained sky settled over the city.\nSitting in New York, I got regular updates from my brother, who\nrelayed photos of Sydney\u2019s ash-thick atmosphere and its effects on his\notherwise robust physiology: the stinging eyes and burning lungs, the need to\noperate at half-speed in open air.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p>By the time I arrived back in Sydney, a few days before Christmas,\nthe haze over the city had abated, but the smell of smoke as I exited the\nairport was both powerful and alarming\u2014alarming because the climate had altered but people\u2019s lives,\napparently, had not. Whether this displayed admirable human adaptability or\nmeek acquiescence before an unconscionable new ecological reality, I couldn\u2019t tell. I grew up in Sydney and lived here for almost three decades before\nmoving to the United States. Nothing about this air, this fire season, was normal. On the\nway out of the airport, I noticed an Australian flag flying at half-mast.

Meanwhile, vast swaths of the country\u2019s southeast were going up in\nflames: While the prime minister was off doing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1207743438583549952?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shakas<\/a> on the beaches of Hawaii,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/19/419c-australia-records-hottest-ever-day-one-day-after-previous-record\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australia endured its hottest day ever<\/a>, with the average temperature across the entire\ncontinent, a land mass equivalent in size to the contiguous United States,\nreaching 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit). On his return, Morrison found a nation engulfed and a\npopulation enraged.

Just as these fires have\ncreated their own weather systems, so too Australia\u2019s political leaders have\ncreated their own kind of reality to address the destruction.&nbsp;<br>\n<\/p><p>First there was a studied prime ministerial silence. Then, on New\nYear\u2019s Day, came a pantomime of normality: Morrison recorded a message in which\nhe cheerily assured Australians that \u201cwe live in the most amazing country on\nearth.\u201d Later that day, he hosted the cricket teams of Australia and New Zealand at his Sydney residence and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/pm-declares-the-pink-test-will-be-played-in-the-shadow-of-tragedy-20200101-p53o5t.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">posed<\/a>, amid the smoke haze still choking the city, for a photo with the\nplayers. Those fighting the fires, he said, would be \u201cinspired by the\ngreat feats of our cricketers.\u201d Children played in the background on grass turned as gray as a\ndead man\u2019s teeth. By this point, the bushfires were so ferocious that many of\nthem blew through containment lines built up through back-burning, forest-clearing, and other hazard-reduction methods: One firefighter <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/breakfast/greg-mullins-bushfires/11839122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">witnessed<\/a> a fire in an area that had burned only two\nweeks previously, but \u201cthe burnt leaves were burning again.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p><span>The next day, when Morrison finally toured fire-devastated\ncommunities south of Sydney, the scale of the destruction\u2014and the depth of people\u2019s anger\nat him\u2014was obvious. The most consistent message he <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/scott-morrison-abused-by-bushfire-victims-in-nsw-town-of-cobargo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">heard<\/a><span> from people on the front lines of the inferno that day was \u201cPiss\noff.\u201d Fronting the cameras after he\u2019d run away from the heckles of one town\u2019s\ninhabitants, Morrison looked genuinely bewildered. What I saw in his eyes was\nnot sympathy or sadness but fear: fear at the full, murderous force of climate\nchange and at the unvarnished fury of those left behind to battle it. Here&nbsp;<\/span><span>was a man utterly unsuited to the challenge, with no idea what to\ndo.<\/span><\/p><p>Within a day, that bewilderment was gone, replaced by a prime-ministerial horniness for the macho business of disaster\nrecovery. First Morrison gave Australia what it really needed: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1213330419044638722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">an ad<\/a> boasting of the government\u2019s emergency\n response. Next came some vague\nconcessions to the idea that global warming was a factor in the fires, with the\nobligatory caveat that now was not the time to play politics. Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/bushfire-recovery-fund-to-get-2-billion-over-two-years-20200106-p53p8j.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement<\/a> of a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) bushfire recovery fund, with assistance from the\nAustralian military. Morrison could present himself as the\nnation\u2019s first responder in chief, a man of belated action, while avoiding the\nmessy business of doing anything about the climate change that caused the\nfires. Short-term action has provided cover for long-term inaction. \u201cWhatever it\ntakes, whatever it costs, we will ensure the resilience and future of this\ncountry,\u201d Morrison told the press earlier this week. Whatever it takes, that\nis, except the action most necessary: shifting Australia\u2019s economy away from\nfossil fuels and providing global leadership on climate stabilization.&nbsp;<br>\n<\/p><p>Denial, obfuscation, concession, inaction: In the space of two weeks, Scott Morrison has laid out the emergency-response playbook for pat-earthers everywhere. This is how we should expect\nconservatives to treat Patient Earth as the climate emergency worsens: as the site of\nsuccessive wounds to be treated reactively and in isolation, rather than a sick\norganism in need of urgent, holistic preventive care. These isolated disaster-recovery efforts will continue until, guess what? It will be too late to do\nanything.

But so are the elements keeping the country inert, tied\nto a planet-wrecking prosperity.<\/aside><p>I watched Australia burn from my parents\u2019 house in leafy,\nuntroubled inner Sydney, where I lay on my bed, each day, scrolling through never-ending social media catalogs of human and\nnatural misery with the air conditioning turned down to 19 degrees C (66 degrees Fahrenheit). In this\ncallous way, I contributed to the continuing emissions-borne destruction of the\nplanet. On trips out of the house, I found myself getting pissy at friends,\neven my best and oldest ones, and becoming the type of too-good-for-it expat\nI\u2019d always despised. Where was their rage? In the face of climate\ncatastrophe, a smug liberal amiability reigned. A friend working in human\nrights told me he\u2019d never heard of disillusioned intellectual historian Samuel Moyn or his social justice\u2013oriented&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/books/review/samuel-moyn-not-enough.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">critique of the human rights movement<\/a>.

It\u2019s long astonished and distressed me that a land with so much\nintelligence, energy, and wit\u2014a place of such charm and easy charisma\u2014could simultaneously be so unadventurous,\nself-satisfied, and lazy. Clive James, the Australian writer who recently died\nafter a decades-long run as perhaps the English-speaking world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/clive-james-got-it-right\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sharpest and funniest critic<\/a>, was also a climate change denier. Paradoxes\nabound in Australia, especially when it comes to natural resources policy: The country is the largest net exporter of coal\nin the world but has massive reserves of lithium and solar energy potential,\nplacing it among the prospective powerhouses of a global renewable energy\nfuture. Whatever the moral and ecological imperatives for climate change action\nin Australia today\u2014and they are overwhelming\u2014the economic case is also compelling. However\ngood the country\u2019s present is, the future could be so much better. All the\nresources needed for a just transition to a low-carbon economy are staring\nAustralia in the face. But so are the elements keeping the country inert, tied\nto a planet-wrecking prosperity: a conservative political establishment\nunconvinced by the need for decarbonization; powerful fossil fuel interests;\nand a News Corp\u2013saturated media happy to push the poisonous lie that global\nwarming is a libtard con.

Former conservative Prime Minister John Howard <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6119952487001\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">said<\/a> recently that the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d\u2014those undemonstrative middle-class voters who\ndelivered Morrison a surprise win in last May\u2019s federal election, despite polls\nconsistently favoring Labor\u2014want \u201cbalance\u201d in the \u201cdebate\u201d about bushfire\nsolutions. But the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d who pose the greatest danger to the\ncountry are not the ones voting for climate inactivists like Morrison out of\nignorance or misinformation. They are the Australians who should be loud but\ncan\u2019t be bothered to raise their voices\u2014those who know better, who understand the consequences of doing\nnothing on climate change, but have succumbed to the apathy of prosperity and\nare content to let a vote for the Labor or Green parties, or the occasional\nspicy tweet, define the limit of their moral courage. (And to be clear, I count\nmyself among this group: What have I contributed to efforts to combat\nclimate change? To date, essentially nothing.)&nbsp;<\/p><p><span>Even with months left to run in the Australian summer, things\n will, of course, return to some semblance of what we used to call \u201cnormality\u201d: The heat will relent; it will rain, although probably not enough; winter will come. Then, before long, another catastrophe will be upon us. My hope, like the hope of many around me, is that these\n fires will be a catalyst for Australians everywhere\u2014to permanent climate\n rage, and to an unceasing commitment to rapid, equitable, planetwide\n decarbonization.

By October, still in the belly of the southern\nhemisphere\u2019s spring season, fires to Sydney\u2019s west and south blew out of\ncontrol, and the cloak of a climate change\u2013stained sky settled over the city.\nSitting in New York, I got regular updates from my brother, who\nrelayed photos of Sydney\u2019s ash-thick atmosphere and its effects on his\notherwise robust physiology: the stinging eyes and burning lungs, the need to\noperate at half-speed in open air.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p>By the time I arrived back in Sydney, a few days before Christmas,\nthe haze over the city had abated, but the smell of smoke as I exited the\nairport was both powerful and alarming\u2014alarming because the climate had altered but people\u2019s lives,\napparently, had not. Whether this displayed admirable human adaptability or\nmeek acquiescence before an unconscionable new ecological reality, I couldn\u2019t tell. I grew up in Sydney and lived here for almost three decades before\nmoving to the United States. Nothing about this air, this fire season, was normal. On the\nway out of the airport, I noticed an Australian flag flying at half-mast. With a\nmawkishness that was only a little self-conscious, I took it as an omen for the\ncountry\u2019s vital prospects.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In <i>The Biggest Estate on\nEarth<\/i>, his account of the sophisticated land-management systems indigenous\nAustralians developed prior to the continent\u2019s colonization by the British,\nhistorian Bill Gammage wrote about how Aborigines used fire \u201cto shape the land. It was a major totem,\na friend. Like songlines, fire unified Australia.\u201d Today fire has unified\nAustralia once again but in shared suffering rather than as a tool for the\n common enjoyment of the land. In those first few\ndays back, the stink of the country\u2019s incinerating forests hit me every time I\nwalked outside. The worst fires were hundreds of miles away. Death was in everyone\u2019s nostrils.&nbsp;<\/p><p>To anyone still refusing to accept the connection between\nanthropogenic climate change and these unprecedented fires, the simple act of\nbreathing offered a powerful rebuttal. But many in the nation\u2019s conservative\ngovernment remained unpersuaded\u2014as\n if 2019 being the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/01/06/australia-fires-how-climate-change-worsening-fires/2824201001/\">hottest and driest year on record<\/a> had little to do with the readiness of the land to ignite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p><p>On December 21, Michael McCormack, the acting prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/21/mccormack-concedes-australia-must-do-more-to-fight-climate-crisis-but-links-fires-to-self-combusting-manure?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">argued<\/a> there was \u201ca lot of hysteria about climate\nchange\u201d and that other factors were equally to blame for the bushfires: \u201cThere has been dry lightning strikes, there has been self-combusting piles of\nmanure, there has been a lot of arsonists out there causing fire.\u201d\nSelf-combusting piles of manure: With that, Australia\u2019s leaders called\u2014quite literally\u2014bullshit on the fires, and the curtain was raised on a two-week\nparade of political idiocy almost as monumental and catastrophic as the fires\nthemselves.&nbsp; <br>\n<\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right figure-active\">In the space of two weeks, Scott Morrison has laid out the emergency-response playbook for pat-earthers everywhere.<\/aside><p>McCormack was acting as prime minister because the real prime\nminister, Scott Morrison, had skipped off on a family holiday to Hawaii just as\nthe bushfires entered their most destructive phase. Canceling the holiday would have disappointed his\ndaughters, Morrison&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/20/scott-morrison-apologises-for-taking-holiday-during-australias-bushfire-crisis\">explained<\/a>; besides, his family had not enjoyed a vacation\nsince May. Meanwhile, vast swaths of the country\u2019s southeast were going up in\nflames: While the prime minister was off doing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samanthamaiden/status/1207743438583549952?\">shakas<\/a> on the beaches of Hawaii,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/19/419c-australia-records-hottest-ever-day-one-day-after-previous-record\">Australia endured its hottest day ever<\/a>, with the average temperature across the entire\ncontinent, a land mass equivalent in size to the contiguous United States,\nreaching 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit). On his return, Morrison found a nation engulfed and a\npopulation enraged. His response was to carry on as if the fires were nothing\nout of the ordinary, a bit of summer heat like the heat of any other summer.\nAmong the many violent spectacles of this fire season\u2014the thousands <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MireilleJuchau/status/1212657401679114240\">stranded<\/a> on beaches and long stretches of country road\nstacked with <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-05/fire-bushfire-dead-livestock-farmers-agforce-animal-carcasses/11841868\">torched cattle<\/a>, the birds <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martine_maron/status/1208276950357176320?s=21\">dropping dead<\/a> in the middle of the day, the baby kangaroos <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/the-photos-that-sum-up-australias-horrific-unprecedented-bushfire-crisis/news-story/0cb198e61d52a9cb4289232ff3b0ab7c\">immolated<\/a> on farm fences, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/jan/04/bushfire-tornado-tears-through-kangaroo-island-in-south-australia-video\">fire tornadoes<\/a> and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-01/victoria-bushfire-child-on-boat-in-mallacoota-allison-marion/11835512\">bloody skies<\/a>\u2014perhaps the most hellish has been the march of the <a href=\"https://qz.com/1779572/how-australias-massive-bushfires-are-generating-thunderstorms/\">pyrocumulus clouds<\/a>, the product of smoke plumes so big they can\ngenerate lightning that spreads fire even further. Just as these fires have\ncreated their own weather systems, so too Australia\u2019s political leaders have\ncreated their own kind of reality to address the destruction.&nbsp;<br>\n<\/p><p>First there was a studied prime ministerial silence. Then, on New\nYear\u2019s Day, came a pantomime of normality: Morrison recorded a message in which\nhe cheerily assured Australians that \u201cwe live in the most amazing country on\nearth.\u201d Later that day, he hosted the cricket teams of Australia and New Zealand at his Sydney residence and <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/pm-declares-the-pink-test-will-be-played-in-the-shadow-of-tragedy-20200101-p53o5t.html\">posed<\/a>, amid the smoke haze still choking the city, for a photo with the\nplayers. Those fighting the fires, he said, would be \u201cinspired by the\ngreat feats of our cricketers.\u201d Children played in the background on grass turned as gray as a\ndead man\u2019s teeth. By this point, the bushfires were so ferocious that many of\nthem blew through containment lines built up through back-burning, forest-clearing, and other hazard-reduction methods: One firefighter <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/breakfast/greg-mullins-bushfires/11839122\">witnessed<\/a> a fire in an area that had burned only two\nweeks previously, but \u201cthe burnt leaves were burning again.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p><span>The next day, when Morrison finally toured fire-devastated\ncommunities south of Sydney, the scale of the destruction\u2014and the depth of people\u2019s anger\nat him\u2014was obvious. The most consistent message he <\/span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/02/scott-morrison-abused-by-bushfire-victims-in-nsw-town-of-cobargo\">heard<\/a><span> from people on the front lines of the inferno that day was \u201cPiss\noff.\u201d Fronting the cameras after he\u2019d run away from the heckles of one town\u2019s\ninhabitants, Morrison looked genuinely bewildered. What I saw in his eyes was\nnot sympathy or sadness but fear: fear at the full, murderous force of climate\nchange and at the unvarnished fury of those left behind to battle it. Here&nbsp;<\/span><span>was a man utterly unsuited to the challenge, with no idea what to\ndo.<\/span><\/p><p>Within a day, that bewilderment was gone, replaced by a prime-ministerial horniness for the macho business of disaster\nrecovery. First Morrison gave Australia what it really needed: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1213330419044638722\">an ad<\/a> boasting of the government\u2019s emergency\n response. Next came some vague\nconcessions to the idea that global warming was a factor in the fires, with the\nobligatory caveat that now was not the time to play politics. Finally, the <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/bushfire-recovery-fund-to-get-2-billion-over-two-years-20200106-p53p8j.html\">announcement<\/a> of a 2 billion Australian dollar ($1.4 billion) bushfire recovery fund, with assistance from the\nAustralian military. Morrison could present himself as the\nnation\u2019s first responder in chief, a man of belated action, while avoiding the\nmessy business of doing anything about the climate change that caused the\nfires. Short-term action has provided cover for long-term inaction. \u201cWhatever it\ntakes, whatever it costs, we will ensure the resilience and future of this\ncountry,\u201d Morrison told the press earlier this week. Whatever it takes, that\nis, except the action most necessary: shifting Australia\u2019s economy away from\nfossil fuels and providing global leadership on climate stabilization.&nbsp;<br>\n<\/p><p>Denial, obfuscation, concession, inaction: In the space of two weeks, Scott Morrison has laid out the emergency-response playbook for pat-earthers everywhere. This is how we should expect\nconservatives to treat Patient Earth as the climate emergency worsens: as the site of\nsuccessive wounds to be treated reactively and in isolation, rather than a sick\norganism in need of urgent, holistic preventive care. These isolated disaster-recovery efforts will continue until, guess what? It will be too late to do\nanything. And by then, the planet will be lost to us.<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left\">All the\nresources needed for a just transition to a low-carbon economy are staring\nAustralia in the face. But so are the elements keeping the country inert, tied\nto a planet-wrecking prosperity.<\/aside><p>I watched Australia burn from my parents\u2019 house in leafy,\nuntroubled inner Sydney, where I lay on my bed, each day, scrolling through never-ending social media catalogs of human and\nnatural misery with the air conditioning turned down to 19 degrees C (66 degrees Fahrenheit). In this\ncallous way, I contributed to the continuing emissions-borne destruction of the\nplanet. On trips out of the house, I found myself getting pissy at friends,\neven my best and oldest ones, and becoming the type of too-good-for-it expat\nI\u2019d always despised. Where was their rage? In the face of climate\ncatastrophe, a smug liberal amiability reigned. A friend working in human\nrights told me he\u2019d never heard of disillusioned intellectual historian Samuel Moyn or his social justice\u2013oriented&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/books/review/samuel-moyn-not-enough.html\">critique of the human rights movement<\/a>. Another friend, when I mentioned I was\nthinking of writing about Ezra\n Klein\u2019s forthcoming book on political polarization, questioned why I would ever \u201cdunk\u201d on Ezra,\nwho \u201cseems so nice\u201d and has a \u201cgreat podcast.\u201d At a house party on New Year\u2019s\nEve, at which everyone seemed hungover and unhappy, someone told me that it\nwould be wrong to cancel Sydney\u2019s famous midnight fireworks, whatever the\ntastelessness of their spectacle in the middle of a national catastrophe,\nbecause \u201cthey contribute $100 million to the local economy.\u201d Had people here\nalways been this ignorant and unquestioning, or was I simply blinded in the\npast by affection for those close to me?&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p>Contradiction and absurdity haunt\n many countries in the climate change era, but each country has its own flavor\n of destructive denialism, and Australia is no exception. It\u2019s long astonished and distressed me that a land with so much\nintelligence, energy, and wit\u2014a place of such charm and easy charisma\u2014could simultaneously be so unadventurous,\nself-satisfied, and lazy. Clive James, the Australian writer who recently died\nafter a decades-long run as perhaps the English-speaking world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/postscript/clive-james-got-it-right\">sharpest and funniest critic<\/a>, was also a climate change denier. Paradoxes\nabound in Australia, especially when it comes to natural resources policy: The country is the largest net exporter of coal\nin the world but has massive reserves of lithium and solar energy potential,\nplacing it among the prospective powerhouses of a global renewable energy\nfuture. Whatever the moral and ecological imperatives for climate change action\nin Australia today\u2014and they are overwhelming\u2014the economic case is also compelling. However\ngood the country\u2019s present is, the future could be so much better. All the\nresources needed for a just transition to a low-carbon economy are staring\nAustralia in the face. But so are the elements keeping the country inert, tied\nto a planet-wrecking prosperity: a conservative political establishment\nunconvinced by the need for decarbonization; powerful fossil fuel interests;\nand a News Corp\u2013saturated media happy to push the poisonous lie that global\nwarming is a libtard con. The country\u2019s promise is vast, like its\nparalysis.&nbsp;<br>\n<\/p><p>Already the <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/john-howard-praises-scott-morrison-but-urges-him-to-work-with-states-20200105-p53p1u.html\">talk<\/a>, even among the conservative grandees wheeled out to pay lip\nservice to anthropogenic climate change, is of the role drought, fuel loads, and\narsonists\u2014anything but the changing climate\u2014have played in stoking the fires. Former conservative Prime Minister John Howard <a href=\"https://www.skynews.com.au/details/_6119952487001\">said<\/a> recently that the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d\u2014those undemonstrative middle-class voters who\ndelivered Morrison a surprise win in last May\u2019s federal election, despite polls\nconsistently favoring Labor\u2014want \u201cbalance\u201d in the \u201cdebate\u201d about bushfire\nsolutions. But the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d who pose the greatest danger to the\ncountry are not the ones voting for climate inactivists like Morrison out of\nignorance or misinformation. They are the Australians who should be loud but\ncan\u2019t be bothered to raise their voices\u2014those who know better, who understand the consequences of doing\nnothing on climate change, but have succumbed to the apathy of prosperity and\nare content to let a vote for the Labor or Green parties, or the occasional\nspicy tweet, define the limit of their moral courage. (And to be clear, I count\nmyself among this group: What have I contributed to efforts to combat\nclimate change? To date, essentially nothing.)&nbsp;<\/p><p><span>Even with months left to run in the Australian summer, things\n will, of course, return to some semblance of what we used to call \u201cnormality\u201d: The heat will relent; it will rain, although probably not enough; winter will come. Then, before long, another catastrophe will be upon us. My hope, like the hope of many around me, is that these\n fires will be a catalyst for Australians everywhere\u2014to permanent climate\n rage, and to an unceasing commitment to rapid, equitable, planetwide\n decarbonization. We are in the contest of our lives.<\/span><\/p><p><a><\/a>This moment in history is obviously an end. If we are industrious and lucky,\n it will be merely the end of the fossil fuel era, rather than of human civilization itself. Whether this moment also prefigures a beginning is up to us.

By\nMonday of this week, as I came to start work on this piece, I pulled my laptop\nfrom its place on the desk in my room, where it had sat mostly undisturbed,\nnear an open window, for days.

He became interested in humanity\u2019s transformation of the Earth in 2013, after he started wondering why the forest near his home in California had become overgrown.

contenteditable=\"false\"><p class=\"color-me-badd\">&lt;p&gt;The U.S.-Mexico border is home to numerous wide-ranging animals, including bighorn and pronghorn sheep, the Mexican gray wolf, ocelots, and the elusive North American jaguar, along with dozens of others that migrate north to south and back again each year. Also in range are 1,500 other native animals, 62 of which are listed as critically endangered. As the planet\u2019s temperature increases, animals and plants are currently migrating to cooler zones, up slopes and toward the poles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building a 1,500-mile-long permanent barrier across one of the most sensitive landscapes in America, in addition to the impact on humans, could split breeding animal populations in half. It could also leave the southern creatures trapped while the other half slowly migrate to the cooler north.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<\/p><\/figure><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"animals-eye-view-mass-extinction-progress","updatedAt":"2020-01-08T17:49:49.974Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-07T11:00:00.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156019/animals-eye-view-mass-extinction-progress","ledeImageCaption":"Invasive Asian carp plague the watersheds of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers.","galleries":[],"status":"PUBLISHED","meta":{"template":"full","hideHeader":false,"wordCount":1682,"ledeOverrideSource":"<style>\n    #article-156019 .article-title,\n    #article-156019 .article-meta {\n        background: transparent;\n        padding-bottom: 2em;\n\n    }\n\n    #article-156019 .article-headline,\n    #article-156019 .article-subhead,\n    #article-156019 .article-meta,\n    #article-156019 .article-meta a,\n    #article-156019 .article-media-credit {\n        text-align: center;\n        color: #000;\n    }\n\n    #article-156019 .article-headline {\n        font-family: 'Balto', sans-serif;\n        line-height: 1;\n        font-weight: 900;\n        max-width: 780px;\n        margin-left: auto;\n        margin-right: auto;\n        margin-top: 60px;\n        line-height: 1.2;\n    }\n    @media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n        #article-156019 .article-headline {\n            font-size: 56px;\n        }\n    }\n    #article-156019 .article-subhead {\n        max-width: 720px;\n        margin-left: auto;\n        margin-right: auto;\n    }\n\n    #article-156019 .article-byline {\n        padding: 0; \n        margin: 0;\n    }\n    #article-156019 .article-date {\n        padding: 0;\n        display: block;\n        border: none;\n        margin: 2em 0 0 0;\n    }\n\t#article-156019 figure + .article-text-wrap :not(.not-this) p:first-child::before, #article-156019 .article-text-grid :not(.not-this) figure + p:first-child::before {\n    \tdisplay: block;\n    \tcontent: '';\n    \twidth: 90px;\n    \theight: 2px;\n    \tmargin-bottom: .9em;\n    \tbackground: #555;\n    }\n\n    #article-156019 figure + .article-text-wrap :not(.not-this) p:first-child, #article-156019 .article-text-grid :not(.not-this) figure + p:first-child {\n    \tfont-family: \"Balto\", sans-serif;\n    \tfont-size: 18px;\n    \tline-height: 26px;\n    \tfont-weight: 300;\n    }\n    \n    #article-156019 .article-embed p:nth-child(2) {\n    \tfont-family: \"Balto\", sans-serif;\n    \tfont-size: 18px;\n    \tline-height: 26px;\n    \tfont-weight: 300;\n    }\n\n\t#article-156019  .article-media-credit {\n\t\tfont-size:17px;\n\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\tmargin-top: 1em;\n\t}\n\t#article-156019 .author-list-comma {\n\t\tdisplay: none;\n\t}\n\t#article-156019  .author-list-item:last-child {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1rem;\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t}\n\t#article-156019  .author-list-item:last-child::before {\n\t\tcontent: 'Photographs by ';\n\t\tfont-weight: 500;\n\t\tdisplay: inline;\n\t}\n    #article-156019 .spacer {\n        margin-top: 6em;\n    }\n<\/style>","disableAds":true,"hideLede":false},"tags":[{"id":"53b863ea-bac8-4f4a-845c-19f01f8923fd","label":"Climate Change","slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"0ed85d02-0da0-436f-841d-8ba0f5ed2062","label":"-recirc-suppress","slug":"recirc-suppress"},{"id":"cc1847aa-f75e-4e4b-8cf1-b86cbdede84e","label":"Photography","slug":"photography"},{"id":"772ff38e-6e8e-47ce-a465-8229dc5ab401","label":"Photo essay","slug":"photo-essay"},{"id":"30b7af11-fe9d-4a41-8414-c8e54403ee9a","label":"Extinction","slug":"extinction"}],"ledeImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/bdcb31ac152b8ca657e9525f9f426c28a8168dd1.jpeg","width":1800,"format":"JPEG","id":"5f17408b-131b-491c-8aa1-cd30a51ff6e4","isAnimated":false,"hash":"bdcb31ac152b8ca657e9525f9f426c28a8168dd1","height":1200,"meta":{}},"lock":{"createdAt":"2020-01-08T17:28:22.705Z","modelId":"37b3686d-d15b-4c4b-a385-a75b4aada175","UserId":"ba249a31-a4f9-4bb8-bbb8-bf5fc59be573","isLocked":true,"model":"Article","id":"95d60680-015c-48bd-aa42-43f8462319d3","updatedAt":"2020-01-08T17:28:22.705Z","user":{"cover":null,"createdAt":"2015-10-21T15:19:16.420Z","name":"Stephanie Heimann","id":"ba249a31-a4f9-4bb8-bbb8-bf5fc59be573","avatar":null}},"authors":[{"UserId":null,"name":"Jordan G.

Diversity training is currently mandated at most Fortune 500 companies and about half of all midsize firms in the United States. In addition, nearly two-thirds of colleges and universities use diversity trainings, and about 30 percent require their faculty to attend them. And, of course, in the wake of race-related public relations disasters, it\u2019s now standard practice for corporations to conduct nationwide company sensitivity trainings, like the ones <a href=\"http://anthronow.com/uncommon-sense/why-doesnt-diversity-training-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hastily rolled out<\/a> by Sephora and Starbucks after instances of racial profiling at their stores. <\/p><p>Despite this rapid growth, today\u2019s diversity industry has largely failed to usher in the diverse workplaces and schools it promises. A growing number of empirical studies suggest that anti-bias training (also known as implicit bias training) and other diversity initiatives don\u2019t work. A recent <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">study<\/a> by sociologists Frank Dobbin at Harvard University and Alexandra Kalev at Tel Aviv University, surveying more than 30 years of data collected from over 800 firms, found that diversity programs not only failed to increase workplace diversity, but in many cases even <em>reduced<\/em> diversity or exacerbated participants\u2019 biases. A 2016 meta-analysis of nearly 500 studies on implicit bias interventions similarly found that while such sessions sometimes briefly and slightly diminished participants\u2019 implicit biases, they had no significant long-term effects on people\u2019s behavior or attitudes. And in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7778\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">another study<\/a> of diversity training programs by a team of behavioral scientists further confirmed that onetime interventions designed to reduce implicit bias\u2014the type used by the vast majority of employers and institutions\u2014tend not to change very many minds at all. <\/p><p>How, exactly, should we reconcile the vast sum of money and energy poured into diversity training with its lackluster results? Two recent books argue that a more thoroughgoing accounting of racism is needed to correct our society\u2019s deficiencies. In <em><a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/pamela-newkirk/diversity-inc/9781568588230/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diversity, Inc: The Failed Promise of a Billion-Dollar Business<\/a><\/em>, NYU journalism Professor Pamela Newkirk argues that diversity is likely to remain elusive until we address the larger context of our nation\u2019s history of racial segregation and violence. This kind of reckoning is also the subject of <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566247/white-fragility-by-robin-diangelo/9780807047415/readers-guide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Fragility<\/a><\/em>, a runaway hit that has spent over a year on the <em>New York Times<\/em> bestseller list and amassed an array of favorable reviews since its 2018 release. In the book, author Robin DiAngelo\u2014a sought-after speaker and former professor who\u2019s worked for decades as an anti-bias consultant\u2014describes the phenomenon of \u201cwhite fragility,\u201d a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">condition<\/a> that renders white Americans unable to discuss race and racism without succumbing to defensiveness and emotional distress, and that thereby perpetuates our racial hierarchy. Overcoming this hostility, DiAngelo argues, requires sustained self-reflection, humility, and vigilance from white people. <\/p><p>Although Newkirk is critical of the diversity industry, whereas DiAngelo works squarely within it, both authors view altering white consciousness as the key to social transformation. And while this is a perspective that has found quite a bit of traction, it strikes me as the type of righteous-sounding injunction that poses little actual threat to current, historically high levels of inequality. The rich are perfectly capable of embracing the vocabulary of racial justice while simultaneously segregating schools, union-busting, and rending the social safety net. A politics of introspection does not work toward policies to combat any of this. Which suits our current economic order\u2014and the diversity industry that operates within it\u2014just fine. <span> <\/span><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><i>Diversity, Inc<\/i>. surveys the state of chronic racial underrepresentation across several elite spheres, including Hollywood, academia, and corporate America\u2014historically racially homogeneous sectors that, to this day, have struggled to diversify their ranks. In Hollywood, for example, a recent industry report on the top films of the last 10 years found that only 4 percent of directors were women, only 6 percent black, and around 3 percent Asian. Just under 4.5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs today are black, Hispanic, or Asian, though those groups make up a combined 38 percent of the population. And, at colleges and universities, supposedly liberal bastions, whites continue to hold 83 percent of full-time professorships. <\/p><p>Newkirk proposes that diversity initiatives have met so little success in these areas because they diverge in ideology and intent from civil rights\u2013era programs that sought to put the nation on a track to racial equality. Rather than agitating for social reform, today\u2019s massive diversity industry functions instead to shield institutions from discrimination litigation and public scrutiny. Diversity training might be expensive, Newkirk notes, but requiring employees to take an hour-long online anti-bias course or even hiring trainers to conduct in-person seminars still costs significantly less time and money than a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/17/business/coca-cola-settles-racial-bias-case.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">discrimination lawsuit<\/a>, like the one that cost Texaco $176 million in 1996 or the one that cost Coca-Cola $192.5 million in 2000. <\/p><p>According to Newkirk, for-profit companies, higher education, and cultural institutions alike will only achieve true and sustained racial diversity following a broader cultural shift in which Americans, particularly white Americans, come to terms with the nation\u2019s history of white domination, which began with the enslavement of Africans and the displacement and mass murder of Native Americans, and continued through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries via exclusionary immigration laws and imperial excursions abroad. In Newkirk\u2019s view, even most of the scholarly research on the shortcomings of diversity training\u2014such as Dobbin and Kalev\u2019s study\u2014fails to capture the way the diversity industry has come untethered from a larger project of accounting for this ugly history. \u201cWhile many recent studies raise legitimate concerns about diversity practices,\u201d she writes, \u201cmost have overshadowed the extent to which these initiatives ceased to be seen as a moral imperative linked to centuries of systemic racial oppression.\u201d <\/p><p>By contrast, she argues, <a href=\"/article/146922/realistic-ambitions\">Great Society programs<\/a> such as the Civil Rights Act and Higher Education Act led to significantly increased numbers of African Americans in many public schools that had once been almost exclusively white, as well as within colleges and universities. Though that\u2019s true enough, it\u2019s also here that her diagnosis of the diversity industry\u2019s deficiencies falters. Simply put, while Lyndon Johnson and other architects of Great Society reforms may have sought to create a \u201cracially just and inclusive nation,\u201d as Newkirk puts it, the actual measurable successes of those programs weren\u2019t the result of a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d so much as they were the result of public policy. And the former without the latter, which is essentially what Newkirk offers, poses little threat to today\u2019s ineffective diversity industry. In fact, the work of facilitating the broad \u201cparadigm shift\u201d Newkirk wants to see in lieu of the diversity industry\u2019s empty \u201cpledges, slogans, or well-compensated czars\u201d is increasingly a central part of that very industry. <span> <\/span><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Encouraging white Americans to come to terms with both the country\u2019s history and their own complicity in perpetuating present-day injustice is precisely the goal of Robin DiAngelo\u2019s book <em>White Fragility<\/em>, which was released to much <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-the-defensive-navigating-white-advantage-and-white-fragility/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion<\/a> and acclaim last year. As it happens, DiAngelo has been a longtime facilitator within the diversity training apparatus that Newkirk critiques, and her analysis of white fragility is drawn largely from personal observations gathered during the workshops and seminars she\u2019s run. <\/p><p>Over her years of conducting trainings on race, DiAngelo has observed that white people reliably (and usually immediately) erupt into defensiveness and discomfort when asked to consider the persistence of racism\u2014a response that she calls white fragility. White fragility is itself a product of racism, namely a national history of segregation that has kept whites comfortably protected from the reality of the nation\u2019s racial hierarchy; as a result, DiAngelo argues, most white people find it extremely difficult to talk about race. Examples of white fragility in action include workshop attendees who insist on their color blindness, bring up their own hardships, and even women who cry during discussions of racism. \u201cThese responses work to reinstate white equilibrium,\u201d writes DiAngelo, \u201cas they repel the challenge, return our racial comfort, and maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy.\u201d <\/p><p>Her book is a recent addition to whiteness studies, an academic discipline in which DiAngelo is a professor. While earlier works by W.E.B. Du Bois and other black scholars laid the ground for the development of the field, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-new-new-white-man-toni-morrisons-playing-in-the-dark-turns-25/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">whiteness studies<\/a> took off in the 1990s with the publication of Toni Morrison\u2019s <em>Playing in the Dark<\/em>, David Roediger\u2019s <em>The Wages of Whiteness<\/em>, and Theodore W. Allen\u2019s <em>The Invention of the White Race<\/em>, among other influential texts. These works have provided critical historical interventions over the last 30 years, particularly regarding the construction and evolution of white identity in the United States; they were never imagined as manuals for the transformation of corporate America. From a practical point of view, the political scientist Cedric Johnson has recently <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/black-lives-matter-power-politics-cedric-johnson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">argued<\/a> that whiteness studies promote a fatalistic view of white workers as too hopelessly committed to their racial identity to be won over to a multiracial left coalition. Such a perspective, he writes, inevitably prioritizes reeducating such workers over attempting to organize them. <\/p><p>Indeed, the major shortcoming of <em>White Fragility<\/em> is that it offers almost nothing in the way of concrete political action. Though solving societywide inequality isn\u2019t the goal of her book, DiAngelo notes\u2014and, of course, it would be unrealistic to expect her to single-handedly accomplish such a thing\u2014even her practical suggestions for what white people might do to combat racism amount to little more than personal introspection and self-improvement. That includes learning to cultivate feelings of gratitude and humility (even excitement) upon learning that one has done something racist, listening and \u201cprocessing\u201d in the aftermath of such an event, and a variety of other vague endeavors, such as challenging \u201cour own socialization and investments in racism.\u201d <\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">Self-reflection is ultimately a much easier undertaking than working to build a durable political coalition.<\/aside><p>This style of whiteness training, Johnson <a href=\"https://nonsite.org/article/the-wages-of-roediger-why-three-decades-of-whiteness-studies-has-not-produced-the-left-we-need\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes<\/a>, \u201cencourages sharing one\u2019s origin story, failings and sense of torment, but beyond charitable giving, it does not necessitate sharing resources at the level of redistributive public policy.\u201d It is therapeutic rather than policy-based. In this sense, DiAngelo writes from the same lineage as other white anti-racist educators, including <em><a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2013/08/white-like-me-movie-with-tim-wise-should-be-seen-by-all-especially-white-people.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Like Me<\/a><\/em> author Tim Wise (who blurbed her book) and Peggy McIntosh, writer of the widely shared \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Fact-Sheets-Briefs/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pamphlet<\/a> on white privilege. While ruminating on one\u2019s internalized prejudices may require some psychological heavy lifting, there\u2019s little evidence that it helps produce or sustain material change. And though whiteness educators like DiAngelo may employ the radical-sounding language of critical race theory, self-reflection is ultimately a much easier undertaking than working to build a durable political coalition that actually has the leverage to remake society. <\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>For all their emphasis on discomfort, the kind of racial reckoning advocated by both Newkirk and DiAngelo today exists without much difficulty under capitalism. That is to say, it\u2019s entirely possible\u2014even easy\u2014to advocate for racial diversity and white self-examination while simultaneously endorsing (or at least ignoring) economic inequality. <\/p><p>This conundrum was most famously articulated by the professor and critic Walter Benn Michaels in his controversial 2006 book, <em><a href=\"https://prospect.org/features/trouble-diversity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Trouble With Diversity<\/a><\/em>. \u201cThe commitment to diversity is at best a distraction and at worst an essentially reactionary position,\u201d he wrote, to the <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/magical-capitalism/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">horror<\/a> of many on the left at the time. What he meant wasn\u2019t that diversity in and of itself was bad or undesirable, but that the preoccupation with achieving it usually came at the expense of attacking economic inequality. For quite a few (if not most) people whose primary commitment is championing diversity, the underlying assumption is that our current lopsided distribution of wealth and resources would be justified so long as racial (and gender) disparities were eliminated. That is, it would be acceptable if the top 1 percent of the population reaped the majority share of economic gains and exerted undue influence on the political system so long as that 1 percent was 50 percent female, 14 percent black, 18 percent Latino, and so on. <\/p><p>This is the metric that allows Newkirk to praise Coca-Cola\u2019s diversity programs\u2014which managed to increase the number of African Americans at the senior executive level from one to 49 people over the course of a few years\u2014as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for corporations, while CEO James Quincey earns nearly $17 million annually, or <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/17/these-ceos-make-1000-times-more-than-their-employees/39350499/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">over 1,000 times<\/a> what the average employee makes. It\u2019s what allows Coca-Cola to proudly advertise its strides in \u201crepresentation\u201d while also backing Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, including publishing an interview in which chief financial officer Kathy Waller (an African American woman) praised the bill\u2019s \u201cpotential to reinvigorate job growth and help U.S. companies be more competitive.\u201d <\/p><p>Even more insidiously, the vocabulary of inclusion has lately been wielded to undermine or dismiss broad-based universal policies that would, ironically, disproportionately help people who aren\u2019t white. \u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow,\u201d Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18962/break-up-banks-end-racism-and-sexism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">asked<\/a> on her doomed campaign trail, \u201cwould that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the LGBT community?\u201d Strictly speaking, probably not. But as Michaels has written, \u201cA serious and entirely race-blind transfer of wealth to poor people (even just the $15 dollar an hour minimum wage and even though the majority of people working for minimum wage are white) would do more to benefit poor black people than would the most rigorous and effective enactment and enforcement of every possible antidiscrimination law.\u201d <\/p><p>Overturning our existing hierarchy\u2014rather than just playing musical chairs with its demographics\u2014depends on ending exploitation. The good news is that the kind of universal programs that Michaels and others advocate would go a long way toward doing just that, particularly for black Americans and other historically marginalized groups (recall Newkirk\u2019s own assessment of Great Society initiatives), and they also happen to be relatively popular. The bad news is that powerful political actors\u2014including the Democratic Party elite that just so happens to be quite well-versed in the rhetoric of diversity\u2014are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1196852531307204608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196852531307204608&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F11%2Ffree-college-is-for-rich-kids-cut-it-out-moderate-dems.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fighting<\/a> such reforms tooth and nail. <\/p><p>The question, then, is whether you believe that people\u2019s attitudes can be transformed through common struggle or you think that psychological transformation needs to happen before that struggle can take place. There are arguments for and against each possibility. But you can see why those who earn a paycheck informing people of their latent biases might feel compelled to insist upon the latter.<\/p>","type":"LONGFORM","cleanTitle":"Why Diversity Training Isn\u2019t Enough","createdAt":"2019-12-17T19:25:26.098Z","displayAt":null,"ledeCleanImage":null,"lock":null,"id":"568aaa84-2d00-43ef-944e-7c0f2e71a86d","bodySource":"<p><span>If you\u2019ve consumed liberal media at any point over the last two decades or so, you\u2019re likely aware of the growing attention to (and outrage over) the lack of racial diversity in: Hollywood movies, tech, journalism, Washington, Young Adult books, modeling, college course syllabi, <\/span><em>Forbes<\/em><span>\u2019s annual list of billionaires, socialist organizations, museum curators, museum exhibitions, the faces on U.S. currency, podcasts, Trump\u2019s Cabinet, luxury brands, the cannabis industry, and so on.

And, of course, in the wake of race-related public relations disasters, it\u2019s now standard practice for corporations to conduct nationwide company sensitivity trainings, like the ones <a href=\"http://anthronow.com/uncommon-sense/why-doesnt-diversity-training-work\">hastily rolled out<\/a> by Sephora and Starbucks after instances of racial profiling at their stores. <\/p><p>Despite this rapid growth, today\u2019s diversity industry has largely failed to usher in the diverse workplaces and schools it promises. A growing number of empirical studies suggest that anti-bias training (also known as implicit bias training) and other diversity initiatives don\u2019t work. A recent <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail\">study<\/a> by sociologists Frank Dobbin at Harvard University and Alexandra Kalev at Tel Aviv University, surveying more than 30 years of data collected from over 800 firms, found that diversity programs not only failed to increase workplace diversity, but in many cases even <em>reduced<\/em> diversity or exacerbated participants\u2019 biases. A 2016 meta-analysis of nearly 500 studies on implicit bias interventions similarly found that while such sessions sometimes briefly and slightly diminished participants\u2019 implicit biases, they had no significant long-term effects on people\u2019s behavior or attitudes. And in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/16/7778\">another study<\/a> of diversity training programs by a team of behavioral scientists further confirmed that onetime interventions designed to reduce implicit bias\u2014the type used by the vast majority of employers and institutions\u2014tend not to change very many minds at all. <\/p><p>How, exactly, should we reconcile the vast sum of money and energy poured into diversity training with its lackluster results? Two recent books argue that a more thoroughgoing accounting of racism is needed to correct our society\u2019s deficiencies. In <em><a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/pamela-newkirk/diversity-inc/9781568588230/\">Diversity, Inc: The Failed Promise of a Billion-Dollar Business<\/a><\/em>, NYU journalism Professor Pamela Newkirk argues that diversity is likely to remain elusive until we address the larger context of our nation\u2019s history of racial segregation and violence. This kind of reckoning is also the subject of <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566247/white-fragility-by-robin-diangelo/9780807047415/readers-guide/\">White Fragility<\/a><\/em>, a runaway hit that has spent over a year on the <em>New York Times<\/em> bestseller list and amassed an array of favorable reviews since its 2018 release. In the book, author Robin DiAngelo\u2014a sought-after speaker and former professor who\u2019s worked for decades as an anti-bias consultant\u2014describes the phenomenon of \u201cwhite fragility,\u201d a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism\">condition<\/a> that renders white Americans unable to discuss race and racism without succumbing to defensiveness and emotional distress, and that thereby perpetuates our racial hierarchy. Overcoming this hostility, DiAngelo argues, requires sustained self-reflection, humility, and vigilance from white people. <\/p><p>Although Newkirk is critical of the diversity industry, whereas DiAngelo works squarely within it, both authors view altering white consciousness as the key to social transformation. And while this is a perspective that has found quite a bit of traction, it strikes me as the type of righteous-sounding injunction that poses little actual threat to current, historically high levels of inequality. The rich are perfectly capable of embracing the vocabulary of racial justice while simultaneously segregating schools, union-busting, and rending the social safety net. A politics of introspection does not work toward policies to combat any of this. Which suits our current economic order\u2014and the diversity industry that operates within it\u2014just fine. <span> <\/span><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p><i>Diversity, Inc<\/i>. surveys the state of chronic racial underrepresentation across several elite spheres, including Hollywood, academia, and corporate America\u2014historically racially homogeneous sectors that, to this day, have struggled to diversify their ranks. In Hollywood, for example, a recent industry report on the top films of the last 10 years found that only 4 percent of directors were women, only 6 percent black, and around 3 percent Asian. Just under 4.5 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs today are black, Hispanic, or Asian, though those groups make up a combined 38 percent of the population. And, at colleges and universities, supposedly liberal bastions, whites continue to hold 83 percent of full-time professorships. <\/p><p>Newkirk proposes that diversity initiatives have met so little success in these areas because they diverge in ideology and intent from civil rights\u2013era programs that sought to put the nation on a track to racial equality. Rather than agitating for social reform, today\u2019s massive diversity industry functions instead to shield institutions from discrimination litigation and public scrutiny. Diversity training might be expensive, Newkirk notes, but requiring employees to take an hour-long online anti-bias course or even hiring trainers to conduct in-person seminars still costs significantly less time and money than a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/17/business/coca-cola-settles-racial-bias-case.html\">discrimination lawsuit<\/a>, like the one that cost Texaco $176 million in 1996 or the one that cost Coca-Cola $192.5 million in 2000. <\/p><p>According to Newkirk, for-profit companies, higher education, and cultural institutions alike will only achieve true and sustained racial diversity following a broader cultural shift in which Americans, particularly white Americans, come to terms with the nation\u2019s history of white domination, which began with the enslavement of Africans and the displacement and mass murder of Native Americans, and continued through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries via exclusionary immigration laws and imperial excursions abroad. In Newkirk\u2019s view, even most of the scholarly research on the shortcomings of diversity training\u2014such as Dobbin and Kalev\u2019s study\u2014fails to capture the way the diversity industry has come untethered from a larger project of accounting for this ugly history. \u201cWhile many recent studies raise legitimate concerns about diversity practices,\u201d she writes, \u201cmost have overshadowed the extent to which these initiatives ceased to be seen as a moral imperative linked to centuries of systemic racial oppression.\u201d <\/p><p>By contrast, she argues, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/146922/realistic-ambitions\">Great Society programs<\/a> such as the Civil Rights Act and Higher Education Act led to significantly increased numbers of African Americans in many public schools that had once been almost exclusively white, as well as within colleges and universities. Though that\u2019s true enough, it\u2019s also here that her diagnosis of the diversity industry\u2019s deficiencies falters. Simply put, while Lyndon Johnson and other architects of Great Society reforms may have sought to create a \u201cracially just and inclusive nation,\u201d as Newkirk puts it, the actual measurable successes of those programs weren\u2019t the result of a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d so much as they were the result of public policy. And the former without the latter, which is essentially what Newkirk offers, poses little threat to today\u2019s ineffective diversity industry. In fact, the work of facilitating the broad \u201cparadigm shift\u201d Newkirk wants to see in lieu of the diversity industry\u2019s empty \u201cpledges, slogans, or well-compensated czars\u201d is increasingly a central part of that very industry. <span> <\/span><\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>Encouraging white Americans to come to terms with both the country\u2019s history and their own complicity in perpetuating present-day injustice is precisely the goal of Robin DiAngelo\u2019s book <em>White Fragility<\/em>, which was released to much <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/on-the-defensive-navigating-white-advantage-and-white-fragility/\">discussion<\/a> and acclaim last year. As it happens, DiAngelo has been a longtime facilitator within the diversity training apparatus that Newkirk critiques, and her analysis of white fragility is drawn largely from personal observations gathered during the workshops and seminars she\u2019s run. <\/p><p>Over her years of conducting trainings on race, DiAngelo has observed that white people reliably (and usually immediately) erupt into defensiveness and discomfort when asked to consider the persistence of racism\u2014a response that she calls white fragility. White fragility is itself a product of racism, namely a national history of segregation that has kept whites comfortably protected from the reality of the nation\u2019s racial hierarchy; as a result, DiAngelo argues, most white people find it extremely difficult to talk about race. Examples of white fragility in action include workshop attendees who insist on their color blindness, bring up their own hardships, and even women who cry during discussions of racism. \u201cThese responses work to reinstate white equilibrium,\u201d writes DiAngelo, \u201cas they repel the challenge, return our racial comfort, and maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy.\u201d <\/p><p>Her book is a recent addition to whiteness studies, an academic discipline in which DiAngelo is a professor. While earlier works by W.E.B. Du Bois and other black scholars laid the ground for the development of the field, <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-new-new-white-man-toni-morrisons-playing-in-the-dark-turns-25/\">whiteness studies<\/a> took off in the 1990s with the publication of Toni Morrison\u2019s <em>Playing in the Dark<\/em>, David Roediger\u2019s <em>The Wages of Whiteness<\/em>, and Theodore W. Allen\u2019s <em>The Invention of the White Race<\/em>, among other influential texts. These works have provided critical historical interventions over the last 30 years, particularly regarding the construction and evolution of white identity in the United States; they were never imagined as manuals for the transformation of corporate America. From a practical point of view, the political scientist Cedric Johnson has recently <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/02/black-lives-matter-power-politics-cedric-johnson\">argued<\/a> that whiteness studies promote a fatalistic view of white workers as too hopelessly committed to their racial identity to be won over to a multiracial left coalition. Such a perspective, he writes, inevitably prioritizes reeducating such workers over attempting to organize them. <\/p><p>Indeed, the major shortcoming of <em>White Fragility<\/em> is that it offers almost nothing in the way of concrete political action. Though solving societywide inequality isn\u2019t the goal of her book, DiAngelo notes\u2014and, of course, it would be unrealistic to expect her to single-handedly accomplish such a thing\u2014even her practical suggestions for what white people might do to combat racism amount to little more than personal introspection and self-improvement. That includes learning to cultivate feelings of gratitude and humility (even excitement) upon learning that one has done something racist, listening and \u201cprocessing\u201d in the aftermath of such an event, and a variety of other vague endeavors, such as challenging \u201cour own socialization and investments in racism.\u201d <\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">Self-reflection is ultimately a much easier undertaking than working to build a durable political coalition.<\/aside><p>This style of whiteness training, Johnson <a href=\"https://nonsite.org/article/the-wages-of-roediger-why-three-decades-of-whiteness-studies-has-not-produced-the-left-we-need\">writes<\/a>, \u201cencourages sharing one\u2019s origin story, failings and sense of torment, but beyond charitable giving, it does not necessitate sharing resources at the level of redistributive public policy.\u201d It is therapeutic rather than policy-based. In this sense, DiAngelo writes from the same lineage as other white anti-racist educators, including <em><a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2013/08/white-like-me-movie-with-tim-wise-should-be-seen-by-all-especially-white-people.html\">White Like Me<\/a><\/em> author Tim Wise (who blurbed her book) and Peggy McIntosh, writer of the widely shared \u201cUnpacking the Invisible Knapsack\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wcwonline.org/Fact-Sheets-Briefs/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack-2\">pamphlet<\/a> on white privilege. While ruminating on one\u2019s internalized prejudices may require some psychological heavy lifting, there\u2019s little evidence that it helps produce or sustain material change. And though whiteness educators like DiAngelo may employ the radical-sounding language of critical race theory, self-reflection is ultimately a much easier undertaking than working to build a durable political coalition that actually has the leverage to remake society. <\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>For all their emphasis on discomfort, the kind of racial reckoning advocated by both Newkirk and DiAngelo today exists without much difficulty under capitalism. That is to say, it\u2019s entirely possible\u2014even easy\u2014to advocate for racial diversity and white self-examination while simultaneously endorsing (or at least ignoring) economic inequality. <\/p><p>This conundrum was most famously articulated by the professor and critic Walter Benn Michaels in his controversial 2006 book, <em><a href=\"https://prospect.org/features/trouble-diversity/\">The Trouble With Diversity<\/a><\/em>. \u201cThe commitment to diversity is at best a distraction and at worst an essentially reactionary position,\u201d he wrote, to the <a href=\"https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/magical-capitalism/\">horror<\/a> of many on the left at the time. What he meant wasn\u2019t that diversity in and of itself was bad or undesirable, but that the preoccupation with achieving it usually came at the expense of attacking economic inequality. For quite a few (if not most) people whose primary commitment is championing diversity, the underlying assumption is that our current lopsided distribution of wealth and resources would be justified so long as racial (and gender) disparities were eliminated. That is, it would be acceptable if the top 1 percent of the population reaped the majority share of economic gains and exerted undue influence on the political system so long as that 1 percent was 50 percent female, 14 percent black, 18 percent Latino, and so on. <\/p><p>This is the metric that allows Newkirk to praise Coca-Cola\u2019s diversity programs\u2014which managed to increase the number of African Americans at the senior executive level from one to 49 people over the course of a few years\u2014as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for corporations, while CEO James Quincey earns nearly $17 million annually, or <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/04/17/these-ceos-make-1000-times-more-than-their-employees/39350499/\">over 1,000 times<\/a> what the average employee makes. It\u2019s what allows Coca-Cola to proudly advertise its strides in \u201crepresentation\u201d while also backing Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, including publishing an interview in which chief financial officer Kathy Waller (an African American woman) praised the bill\u2019s \u201cpotential to reinvigorate job growth and help U.S. companies be more competitive.\u201d <\/p><p>Even more insidiously, the vocabulary of inclusion has lately been wielded to undermine or dismiss broad-based universal policies that would, ironically, disproportionately help people who aren\u2019t white. \u201cIf we broke up the big banks tomorrow,\u201d Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/18962/break-up-banks-end-racism-and-sexism\">asked<\/a> on her doomed campaign trail, \u201cwould that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the LGBT community?\u201d Strictly speaking, probably not. But as Michaels has written, \u201cA serious and entirely race-blind transfer of wealth to poor people (even just the $15 dollar an hour minimum wage and even though the majority of people working for minimum wage are white) would do more to benefit poor black people than would the most rigorous and effective enactment and enforcement of every possible antidiscrimination law.\u201d <\/p><p>Overturning our existing hierarchy\u2014rather than just playing musical chairs with its demographics\u2014depends on ending exploitation. The good news is that the kind of universal programs that Michaels and others advocate would go a long way toward doing just that, particularly for black Americans and other historically marginalized groups (recall Newkirk\u2019s own assessment of Great Society initiatives), and they also happen to be relatively popular. The bad news is that powerful political actors\u2014including the Democratic Party elite that just so happens to be quite well-versed in the rhetoric of diversity\u2014are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1196852531307204608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196852531307204608&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Fbusiness%2F2019%2F11%2Ffree-college-is-for-rich-kids-cut-it-out-moderate-dems.html\">fighting<\/a> such reforms tooth and nail. <\/p><p>The question, then, is whether you believe that people\u2019s attitudes can be transformed through common struggle or you think that psychological transformation needs to happen before that struggle can take place. There are arguments for and against each possibility. But you can see why those who earn a paycheck informing people of their latent biases might feel compelled to insist upon the latter.<\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"diversity-training-isnt-enough-pamela-newkirk-robin-diangelo-books-reviews","updatedAt":"2020-01-07T11:00:00.114Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-07T11:00:00.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156032/diversity-training-isnt-enough-pamela-newkirk-robin-diangelo-books-reviews","ledeImageCaption":null,"galleries":[],"status":"PUBLISHED","tags":[{"id":"04a9f177-1a77-4e06-84b3-6d152f2b5052","label":"January-February 2020","slug":"january-february-2020"},{"id":"4deae86e-45d4-4485-b864-20b4f62c6745","label":"Books & The Arts","slug":"books-and-the-arts"},{"id":"5921a592-06f2-4e79-85b7-115ed383707d","label":"Books","slug":"books"},{"id":"f6bb3de2-0f7d-43e5-ae25-77b26a6603e0","label":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"id":"3046ee55-25d3-43cb-8491-58b17f8004d3","label":"Politics","slug":"politics"},{"id":"8d04c9c1-75a9-4373-8e53-3b15d5847188","label":"Diversity","slug":"diversity"},{"id":"b6846b65-bcf4-484d-b86b-ff96c6524a05","label":"Race","slug":"race"},{"id":"7f3679b8-1ff1-4da6-b474-1c42988b1eff","label":"Economic Inequality","slug":"economic-inequality"},{"id":"a88bfa71-5109-4fb7-81b1-561aaa2edf07","label":"inequality","slug":"inequality"},{"id":"f01e394d-b5c0-4a28-b0eb-d2b7e417dfef","label":"Magazine","slug":"magazine"},{"id":"ec377b6c-1ce7-4085-93b9-1bbbb01b0bde","label":"critical mass","slug":"critical-mass"},{"id":"c7b474cc-ad79-46d8-af9d-8795aa7b7455","label":"Labor","slug":"labor"}],"ledeImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/e1f82100d9f570f126ec3f5ac235249ffa62ae69.jpeg","width":2400,"format":"JPEG","id":"51874205-c007-48ec-a158-360c46caa3a7","isAnimated":false,"hash":"e1f82100d9f570f126ec3f5ac235249ffa62ae69","height":1600,"meta":{}},"authors":[{"UserId":null,"name":"J.C.
