Romance, yes, but also the kind of deeper sexual attachment that appears in her fiction. In <\/span><i>Portrait<\/i><span>, Skelnicka quotes an essay by Adams recalling a childhood friend: \u201cI had never seen a penis before, and I truly thought it was marvelous, so pink and pretty.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span>Skelnicka\u2019s book traces the lines between the author and her art, though the close reader of Adams\u2019s fiction could deduce much of what her biographer illuminates: an upbringing in the South; a stormy father and mother with frustrated artistic ambition, dead too young; an unhappy marriage; a host of affairs. If occasionally the biographer seems to reach, well, that\u2019s her job: to use facts and the historical record to help us understand both the life and the art.<\/span><\/p><p><span>It\u2019s hard to imagine any but the true devotee wading in; I think Adams was a superb writer but I\u2019m not sure I need 500 pages on her. But if you\u2019re the sort who delights in the account of the midcentury artistic life\u2014living on pennies in postwar Paris, selling a short story for enough money to buy a car, palling around with Norman Mailer (perhaps sleeping with him) and Saul Bellow (almost definitely sleeping with him) and Irving Howe (possibly being raped by him)\u2014<\/span><i>Portrait of a Writer <\/i><span>does deliver.<\/span><\/p><p><span>And of course, this is an account of a woman artist. Adams\u2019s teachers discourage her from writing fiction. Just out of college, she marries, because what else can she do? She relocates as her husband\u2019s work dictates (he also aspires to be a writer, but settles for an academic career), landing in Northern California, where she has a child, and tries and repeatedly fails to sell a novel. Skelnicka notes:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p>Adams reacted to the rejection with a sort of shrugging passivity and shape-shifting that one suspects might be a typically female and fifties way of stepping aside from her ambitions. ... \u2018I sometimes wish that writing wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do, or really that I had both more drive and more talent. I have just enough of both to make me uncomfortable.\u2019<\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>Adams was underselling herself; she went on to great success and acclaim. Hers is a cautionary tale of all that women of her generation endured, but also a reminder that so many great artists (Alice Munro and Toni Morrison immediately come to mind) do not find their footing until their fifth decade. If the stories contain Adams the person, as her biographer shows us, I want to believe the older writer came to see herself as someone possessed of both drive and talent. She writes in her 1984 story \u201cReturn Trips\u201d: \u201cA very wise woman who is considerably older than I am once told me that in her view relationships with people to whom we have been very close can continue to change even after the deaths of those people, and for me I think this has been quite true.\u201d This is a beautiful insight. I want to believe that the very wise woman imparting it is Alice Adams herself.<\/span><\/p>","type":"LONGFORM","cleanTitle":"Alice Adams\u2019s Afterlife","createdAt":"2020-01-06T17:37:11.523Z","displayAt":null,"ledeCleanImage":null,"id":"c094cabe-4735-479a-be48-098cc4f25807","bodySource":"<p><span>It\u2019s just one of the tough truths of being an artist that you can publish 17 books and dozens of short stories\u2014in both the big commercial magazines and the beloved literary journals\u2014and wind up, two decades after your death, a footnote.

In \u201cTo See You Again,\u201d a woman remembers a long-ago crush on one of her students\u2014\u201cJust a messy red-haired kid was how someone else might have seen him. Whereas to me: perfect poignant beauty\u201d\u2014when an actor in a film reminds her of him. That\u2019s all: an echo of the past that seems to mean something, an innocent erotic attachment.<\/span><\/p><figure class=\"article-embed image-embed pull-small pull-right\" contenteditable=\"false\"><img src=\"//images.newrepublic.com/eb02de353e05a408e7cc34397a3c02b39dfd5ee5.png?w=630\" data-serialized=\"{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;f6224c7f-ea72-40b8-97a2-f9dd2e9ff297&quot;,&quot;hash&quot;:&quot;eb02de353e05a408e7cc34397a3c02b39dfd5ee5&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:630,&quot;height&quot;:970,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;PNG&quot;,&quot;isAnimated&quot;:false,&quot;baseUrl&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;//images.newrepublic.com/eb02de353e05a408e7cc34397a3c02b39dfd5ee5.png&quot;,&quot;meta&quot;:{}}\" width=\"630\"><figcaption><span class=\"caption-text\">THE STORIES OF ALICE ADAMS<\/span><span class=\"credit\">Vintage, 800 pp., $17.99<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><span>The writer\u2019s life was full of affairs\u2014consuming, passionate, then failed. Romance, yes, but also the kind of deeper sexual attachment that appears in her fiction. In <\/span><i>Portrait<\/i><span>, Skelnicka quotes an essay by Adams recalling a childhood friend: \u201cI had never seen a penis before, and I truly thought it was marvelous, so pink and pretty.\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span>Skelnicka\u2019s book traces the lines between the author and her art, though the close reader of Adams\u2019s fiction could deduce much of what her biographer illuminates: an upbringing in the South; a stormy father and mother with frustrated artistic ambition, dead too young; an unhappy marriage; a host of affairs. If occasionally the biographer seems to reach, well, that\u2019s her job: to use facts and the historical record to help us understand both the life and the art.<\/span><\/p><p><span>It\u2019s hard to imagine any but the true devotee wading in; I think Adams was a superb writer but I\u2019m not sure I need 500 pages on her. But if you\u2019re the sort who delights in the account of the midcentury artistic life\u2014living on pennies in postwar Paris, selling a short story for enough money to buy a car, palling around with Norman Mailer (perhaps sleeping with him) and Saul Bellow (almost definitely sleeping with him) and Irving Howe (possibly being raped by him)\u2014<\/span><i>Portrait of a Writer <\/i><span>does deliver.<\/span><\/p><p><span>And of course, this is an account of a woman artist. Adams\u2019s teachers discourage her from writing fiction. Just out of college, she marries, because what else can she do? She relocates as her husband\u2019s work dictates (he also aspires to be a writer, but settles for an academic career), landing in Northern California, where she has a child, and tries and repeatedly fails to sell a novel. Skelnicka notes:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p>Adams reacted to the rejection with a sort of shrugging passivity and shape-shifting that one suspects might be a typically female and fifties way of stepping aside from her ambitions. ... \u2018I sometimes wish that writing wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do, or really that I had both more drive and more talent. I have just enough of both to make me uncomfortable.\u2019<\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>Adams was underselling herself; she went on to great success and acclaim. Hers is a cautionary tale of all that women of her generation endured, but also a reminder that so many great artists (Alice Munro and Toni Morrison immediately come to mind) do not find their footing until their fifth decade. If the stories contain Adams the person, as her biographer shows us, I want to believe the older writer came to see herself as someone possessed of both drive and talent. She writes in her 1984 story \u201cReturn Trips\u201d: \u201cA very wise woman who is considerably older than I am once told me that in her view relationships with people to whom we have been very close can continue to change even after the deaths of those people, and for me I think this has been quite true.\u201d This is a beautiful insight. I want to believe that the very wise woman imparting it is Alice Adams herself.<\/span><\/p><p><br><\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"alice-adamss-afterlife","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T12:31:39.669Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-09T12:31:39.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156132/alice-adamss-afterlife","ledeImageCaption":"Courtesy of Vera Futscher Pereira","galleries":[],"status":"PUBLISHED","meta":{"hideHeader":false,"wordCount":1007,"disableAds":false,"hideLede":false},"tags":[{"id":"f6bb3de2-0f7d-43e5-ae25-77b26a6603e0","label":"Culture","slug":"culture"},{"id":"ec377b6c-1ce7-4085-93b9-1bbbb01b0bde","label":"critical mass","slug":"critical-mass"},{"id":"5921a592-06f2-4e79-85b7-115ed383707d","label":"Books","slug":"books"},{"id":"4ab5a3ce-6e0f-4596-832a-cb85999f8600","label":"Alice Adams","slug":"alice-adams"},{"id":"0ed85d02-0da0-436f-841d-8ba0f5ed2062","label":"-recirc-suppress","slug":"recirc-suppress"}],"ledeImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/999053caf19bfc6d5eb196a87cf838f7905b4980.jpeg","width":2706,"format":"JPEG","id":"a2af11a7-64d6-4417-bf73-3b36eb01034f","isAnimated":false,"hash":"999053caf19bfc6d5eb196a87cf838f7905b4980","height":1805,"meta":{}},"lock":{"createdAt":"2020-01-09T12:26:50.611Z","modelId":"c094cabe-4735-479a-be48-098cc4f25807","UserId":"09f87c27-0216-4f78-bdb2-713aefab809d","isLocked":true,"model":"Article","id":"dbb7853e-4f6f-438e-94b5-73d1ba74d78f","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T12:26:50.611Z","user":{"cover":null,"createdAt":"2015-11-04T15:16:49.110Z","name":"Ryu Spaeth","id":"09f87c27-0216-4f78-bdb2-713aefab809d","avatar":null}},"authors":[{"UserId":"977c5465-6ae1-4a0b-9b8e-f617f5149833","name":"Rumaan Alam","bio":"<p>Rumaan Alam is a staff writer at <i>The New Republic<\/i>.

Children are the spoonful of proverbial sugar: They make any policy easier to message and easier for the public to accept. For instance, amid the highly divisive debate over American health care policy, public support for national children\u2019s health insurance is <a href=\"https://www.childrensdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/polling-data-childrens-health.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">incredibly robust<\/a>, with large majorities of all political persuasions backing it. Similarly, successful soda tax campaigns have gotten over the line by dedicating revenues to children\u2019s services: Philadelphia, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/news/soda-tax-pediatric-association-pediatrician-heart-association-policy-20190325.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tethered pre-Kindergarten slots<\/a> to their victorious effort.<\/p><p>Carbon pricing programs are an important target because they are proven to both reduce emissions and raise significant revenue. Take for instance the <a href=\"https://www.rggi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative<\/a> (RGGI), a cap-and-trade coalition of ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states (with Virginia poised to become the 11th). Between 2009 and 2016, RGGI <i>halved<\/i> power sector CO2 emissions in member states while having no negative impacts on state economies.

They instituted a straight tax instead of a cap-and-trade system, and they also decided to return every dollar of revenues back to residents via a series of tax credits and breaks. As with the U.S. states, British Columbia found the tax (one of the world\u2019s most aggressive) had no deleterious effect on the economy, and in 2016 raised $1.2 billion<i> <\/i>for a province with a population slightly smaller than Colorado. However, unlike RGGI, there were no investments in clean energy. The emissions reductions have been smaller, on the order of 5 to 15 percent.<\/p><p><span>The most promising path, then, seems to wind through the middle of these two approaches. If, say, 25 percent of carbon revenues were set aside for children, that creates a potentially game-changing pot of money for kids while reinvesting the bulk in improving green infrastructure. As an illustrative example, consider a hypothetical where Colorado mirrors British Columbia. 25 percent of British Columbia\u2019s carbon tax receipts is $300 million.

As a World Resources Institute <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/carbon-tax-vs-cap-and-trade-what-s-better-policy-cut-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">brief<\/a> found in 2016, (emphasis in original) \u201cwhile there are legitimate reasons to favor one form of pricing carbon over the other, <i>if well designed<\/i>, either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program can be the centerpiece of U.S. efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d In either case, bringing children into the mix is a viable, promising, and perhaps politically critical inclusion.<\/p><p>Carbon pricing proposals\u2014particularly more aggressive schemes\u2014are not always popular ideas. In Oregon last year, Republican legislators <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-rogue-republicans-killed-oregons-climate-change-bill\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">literally fled the state<\/a> to spike a vote on cap-and-trade. In 2014, Australia repealed a carbon tax that had only been in place for two years. One major reason, as Charles Frank of the Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2014/08/12/pricing-carbon-a-carbon-tax-or-cap-and-trade/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote<\/a>, was that \u201cthe costs \u2026 were all too apparent, immediate, and substantial. The benefits were not apparent or easily explainable to the body politic.\u201d A large body of climate communications literature <a href=\"https://ssir.org/books/reviews/entry/a_climate_of_mind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">confirms<\/a> it\u2019s hard for people to make perceived sacrifices for what feels like a vague, far-away gain. A policy that directly benefits children in the here-and-now is both apparent and easily explainable.<\/p><p>As the current federal administration continues to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684054/climate-change-clean-power-plan-repeal-affordable-emissions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">actively hinder<\/a> efforts to fight climate change, leadership is increasingly flowing to the states. With more states considering carbon pricing while also wrestling with underfunded child care and public education systems, marrying these two seemingly unrelated policy areas could help solve multiple problems at once. Children could provide carbon pricing programs a much-needed jumpstart in many states. And the pricing programs, in turn, could help secure those children\u2019s future.<\/p>","type":"LONGFORM","cleanTitle":"Give Kids the Money From Carbon Taxes","createdAt":"2020-01-08T20:12:26.915Z","displayAt":null,"ledeCleanImage":null,"lock":null,"id":"a579afd9-f4f6-4dfc-82b4-ec81629b58f0","bodySource":"<p>Children\u2019s increasing prominence in efforts to slow climate change has provoked mixed reactions.

That figure would nearly triple the funding level of Colorado\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https://www.cde.state.co.us/cpplegreport\">state pre-K<\/a><span> program\u2014which can currently serve <\/span><a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2019/12/17/polis-wants-to-expand-colorado-preschool-but-schools-are-full/\">less than half<\/a><span> of eligible children\u2014while reserving hundreds of millions for reducing emissions.<\/span><\/p><p>States are going to need to find what works for them when it comes to carbon pricing mechanisms. There are pros and cons to a tax versus a cap-and-trade system\u2014and its variants, such as <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cap-and-divident-not-trade/\">cap-and-dividend<\/a>, which explicitly returns revenues to consumers. As a World Resources Institute <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/blog/2016/03/carbon-tax-vs-cap-and-trade-what-s-better-policy-cut-emissions\">brief<\/a> found in 2016, (emphasis in original) \u201cwhile there are legitimate reasons to favor one form of pricing carbon over the other, <i>if well designed<\/i>, either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade program can be the centerpiece of U.S. efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d In either case, bringing children into the mix is a viable, promising, and perhaps politically critical inclusion.<\/p><p>Carbon pricing proposals\u2014particularly more aggressive schemes\u2014are not always popular ideas. In Oregon last year, Republican legislators <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-rogue-republicans-killed-oregons-climate-change-bill\">literally fled the state<\/a> to spike a vote on cap-and-trade. In 2014, Australia repealed a carbon tax that had only been in place for two years. One major reason, as Charles Frank of the Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2014/08/12/pricing-carbon-a-carbon-tax-or-cap-and-trade/\">wrote<\/a>, was that \u201cthe costs \u2026 were all too apparent, immediate, and substantial. The benefits were not apparent or easily explainable to the body politic.\u201d A large body of climate communications literature <a href=\"https://ssir.org/books/reviews/entry/a_climate_of_mind\">confirms<\/a> it\u2019s hard for people to make perceived sacrifices for what feels like a vague, far-away gain. A policy that directly benefits children in the here-and-now is both apparent and easily explainable.<\/p><p>As the current federal administration continues to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684054/climate-change-clean-power-plan-repeal-affordable-emissions\">actively hinder<\/a> efforts to fight climate change, leadership is increasingly flowing to the states. With more states considering carbon pricing while also wrestling with underfunded child care and public education systems, marrying these two seemingly unrelated policy areas could help solve multiple problems at once. Children could provide carbon pricing programs a much-needed jumpstart in many states. And the pricing programs, in turn, could help secure those children\u2019s future.<\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"give-kids-money-carbon-taxes","updatedAt":"2020-01-09T11:00:00.117Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-09T11:00:00.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156152/give-kids-money-carbon-taxes","ledeImageCaption":"Four-year-olds wear face masks during California wildfires in 2003.

It extends down to the American individual\u2019s very understanding, production, and consumption of art and entertainment. How else&nbsp;to explain&nbsp;the ill-gotten collection of artifacts missionary <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/27/fbi-raided-year-old-missionarys-home-found-thousands-stolen-native-american-bones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donald Miller hoarded in his Indiana basement<\/a>? You can draw a clean line from the systemic, state-sponsored destruction of Native artifacts and sacred sites to the personal collector\u2019s modern disregard for these artifacts\u2019 provenance and rightful ownership.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Just as there are laws to ostensibly prevent Trump\u2019s threatened war crimes, there are also&nbsp;laws meant to protect Native nations from this kind of looting and desecration.

It\u2019s why Dominion and Duke Energy <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6348/260.1\">tried to claim<\/a> that&nbsp;their&nbsp;Atlantic Coast Pipeline didn\u2019t affect any marginalized communities when its final destination would pump natural gas close to the Lumber River, <a href=\"https://www.robesonian.com/news/103021/tribal-council-wants-lumber-river-renamed-to-honor-lumbee\">an ancestral relative of the Lumbee Tribe<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>This is not just an institutional or corporate issue. It extends down to the American individual\u2019s very understanding, production, and consumption of art and entertainment. How else&nbsp;to explain&nbsp;the ill-gotten collection of artifacts missionary <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/02/27/fbi-raided-year-old-missionarys-home-found-thousands-stolen-native-american-bones/\">Donald Miller hoarded in his Indiana basement<\/a>? You can draw a clean line from the systemic, state-sponsored destruction of Native artifacts and sacred sites to the personal collector\u2019s modern disregard for these artifacts\u2019 provenance and rightful ownership.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Just as there are laws to ostensibly prevent Trump\u2019s threatened war crimes, there are also&nbsp;laws meant to protect Native nations from this kind of looting and desecration. The <a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap21-subchapI-sec1996.pdf\">American Indian Religious Freedom Act<\/a>, passed in 1978, should, as written, allow tribes to practice their religions by securing access to their sacred sites and objects, along with the ability to freely worship and practice ceremonies. But in practice, it only means that a museum has to return any tribal items to the correct tribal nation, leaving a loophole for private collectors like Miller and certainly for the government\u2019s gas and oil pals.<\/p><p>The U.S. government has never given a damn about the sites, items, or natural beings Native people hold dear. Likewise, it has rarely shown actual care for the lives of the people protecting them. It\u2019s in part why Congress has never recognized America\u2019s past slaughtering of Native people as the genocide it is.&nbsp;<\/p><p>This same violent logic applies in the president\u2019s threats against Iran.&nbsp;It applied&nbsp;when American soldiers were <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/iraqs-ruined-library-soldiers/\">ordered to stand down as the Iraq National Library and Archives was sacked<\/a>&nbsp;but put on guard at the Ministry of Oil. Even when threats against cultural artifacts&nbsp;aren\u2019t made explicit, the annihilation of culture\u2014of the sacred and mundane things that anchor people in their histories\u2014is always a consequence of war.&nbsp;The loss of Iranian lives and <a href=\"https://www.cair.com/breaking_cair_wa_assisting_iranian_americans_detained_u_s_border\">attacks on Iranian-Americans\u2019 civil rights<\/a>&nbsp;are the primary horrors of the present military escalation,&nbsp;but the threat to sacred sites is intrinsically connected to this violence. It displays an imperialist nation\u2019s stark lack of respect for both&nbsp;people and the things they hold dear.&nbsp;It\u2019s nothing new.

Ominously, we were ushered into the new year on Friday with the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, a move that prompted an Iranian counterattack on Tuesday evening. Briefly on Monday, it seemed Soleimani\u2019s killing had also set in motion a true end to the war in Iraq\u2014a letter notifying the Iraqi government that American troops would be withdrawn from the country materialized but was soon disavowed by American officials, who said it had been released by mistake. The shock of the past several days was captured by MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes that night:<\/p><blockquote><p><span>A lot of truly horrible things have happened under Donald Trump as president. Nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans died in Puerto Rico after the administration\u2019s weak hurricane response. Thousands of immigrant children separated from their parents kept in cages; dozens of immigrants, including children, have died in ICE custody. But a brand-new war run by this corrupt, incurious president, that is the ultimate fear. A fear that looks very close right now to being a reality. In the wake of his ordering the airstrike of the number two figure in Iran, millions of people marching the streets in Iran, Trump is now tweeting the way he always tweets, making outrageous declarations and threats. But now the difference is this. The stakes are as high as they can possibly be.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p><span>The stakes are indeed high, but for all the anxieties and uncertainties of this moment in the Trump presidency, it should be said that we already know, or ought to know, where many of the situations we face came from and where they are likely to lead. The Senate\u2019s impeachment trial, whenever and however it begins, will end with Trump\u2019s acquittal, an outcome guaranteed by the Constitution\u2019s supermajority requirement for conviction and Trump\u2019s durable popularity within the Republican Party\u2014which would imperil any Republican Senator voting against him, assuming, optimistically, there were a meaningful number willing to do so on the merits of the case to begin with.<\/span><\/p><p><span>The matters to which Hayes referred were, even if not fully predictable, certainly prefigured. The Trump administration\u2019s shoddy response to Hurricane Maria parallels the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina as a reminder of what can befall nonwhite Americans who live at the periphery of our national attention. It was also a reminder, for those open to one, of Puerto Rico\u2019s subjugated status, a legacy of colonial aspirations reinforced by policies like Promesa, the Obama administration\u2019s attempt to force fiscal austerity on the territory at the hands of unelected administrators. Trump\u2019s immigration policies immediately followed, and were partially informed by, the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to deport millions of the undocumented, which also broke up untold numbers of families.<\/span><\/p><p><span>Trump\u2019s assassination of Soleimani, of course, has its own antecedents. War with Iran has long been feared because it has long been plausible, an outcome that, even if it occurs at Trump\u2019s direction, will have been set in motion by decades of American foreign policy. To the extent that Trump has discernible objectives with Iran, they are the very same goals that have guided our relations with the country for years\u2014preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power and further challenging American interests.

The questions of prerogative have been all but settled, the last administration having already established that the U.S. can summarily kill almost anyone abroad that the president considers sufficiently dangerous, up to and including American citizens. Similarly, while Trump\u2019s threat to bomb cultural sites in Iran has been denounced widely, easily, and rightfully as a threat to commit war crimes prohibited by international law, that phrase has only ever been fitfully applied to our torture and abuse of military detainees or our efforts to materially aid Saudi Arabia\u2019s ongoing slaughters of civilians in Yemen. There has long been bipartisan ambivalence, overall, about the legal limits of American military activity and aid, and the present tensions have been crafted not only by Trump but by members of the American political establishment. This is why it was unsurprising to hear, as <\/span><i>The New York Times<\/i><span> has reported, that the killing of Soleimani was pushed aggressively by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014two men who were fairly ordinary Republicans before the Trump administration and will be ordinary Republicans again when it ends.<\/span><\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-right\">The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself.<\/aside><p><span>The great fear taking hold as Americans watch events in Iran and Iraq unfold is that history might repeat or outdo itself.

This is a political impossibility. In the wake of 9/11, the Bush administration held far more credibility among the American public than Trump holds now\u2014more, in fact, than any president is likely to hold again in the near future given the deepening of partisan polarization. Iraq-style regime change seems less likely than an ongoing tit-for-tat.

The latter view has been memefied as the \u201cbig structural change\u201d perspective on the 2020 campaign trail, but its implications are more profound.<\/span><\/p><p><span>For instance, the endless and often tiresome contretemps over the 1619 Project\u2014last year\u2019s examination of slavery\u2019s centrality to the American story in <\/span><i>The New York Times Magazine<\/i><span>\u2014is essentially reducible to a disagreement over whether our country is defined by a set of founding ideals, now and then betrayed or undermined by bad actors, or by a set of structural forces that have materially shaped our political and societal outcomes.

On Monday, <\/span><i>New York <\/i>magazine<span> ran a profile of Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that contained this fairly innocuous passage:<\/span><\/p><blockquote><p><span>I asked her what she thought her role would be as a member of Congress during, for instance, a Joe Biden presidency. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said with a groan. \u201cIn any other country, Joe Biden and I would not be in the same party, but in America, we are.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><p>In democracies across the globe, left-wing politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and politicians closer to the center like Biden do, in fact, often find themselves in different parties. The coalitions that make up the two major American parties are, by comparison, relatively broad, owing in large part to the design of our particular system. But Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark was taken by some as a petty and purely personal slight against Joe Biden and others in the party. Democratic Congressman Ben McAdams, for instance, tweeted that she had offered an example \u201cof why people can\u2019t stand Washington.\u201d <\/p><aside class=\"pullquote pull-left figure-active\">We are always far more interested in the personalities of particular people than we are in the ground under all of our feet.<\/aside><p>These were reactions born of a political discourse that centers individual virtue and conscious agency, a dynamic that has influenced everything from the remarkable argument, earlier in the primary, over the propriety of mildly criticizing the Obama administration from the Democratic debate stage, to the perennial conversations about whether it is fair to ascribe racism or prejudice to those who support racist or prejudiced policies without clear evidence of personal hatred. We are always far more interested in the personalities of particular people than we are in the ground under all of our feet. <\/p><p>This makes it easy for many to view Trump, himself, as the locus of all that ails America and his election as an extraordinary event. That is the perception currently sustaining Biden\u2019s candidacy for the Democratic nomination. In a <i>Politico<\/i> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/07/democratic-primary-2020-095090\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">piece<\/a> Tuesday, reporter David Siders described an event for Biden in Iowa where the audience had already well internalized his warning that Trump\u2019s reelection would \u201cfundamentally change the character of the nation.\u201d<\/p><blockquote><p><span>At a Biden event at the minor league baseball stadium in Davenport, a man asked, \u201cCan America survive Trump in office for another year?\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span>A collection of answers rang out from around the room: \u201cNo.\u201d And before Biden addressed the crowd, Scott County Supervisor Ken Croken cast the weight of the upcoming caucuses in equally somber terms.\u2026<\/span><\/p><p>He said, \u201cI fear that our democracy will not survive four more years of the imperial Trump presidency with his lack of understanding and respect for the Constitution.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It\u2019s fairly likely that no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election, and no matter what happens over the course of the next presidential term, the U.S. will exist at the end of 2024. Trump, obviously, has no respect for the norms that have governed his office, and his abuses of power have been deeply troubling. But the greatest extant threats to the functioning of American democracy today are structural\u2014the disproportionate and growing influence conservative regions hold in the Senate and electoral college, for instance\u2014or involve attempts to undermine the democratic process, including Republican efforts to strip the vote from African Americans. Biden has pledged to protect the vote but has also pledged, sincerely or not, to leave some of the major disparities in our political system untouched even if given the opportunity to reform them and even as they continue to confer power upon politicians who share Trump\u2019s beliefs and have been willing to tolerate his behavior. <\/p><p>That accrual of power, of course, would be aided significantly by a second Trump term. This, again, speaks to what is so structurally troubling about Trump as a political figure and his potential reelection. The Trump presidency, whenever it ends, will have done much not just to worsen the American political situation but also to set us further along the road that brought us to him to begin with\u2014and that may lead us to worse places still. As disorienting as any given moment in what remains of the Trump years may feel, promises for a return to comfortable stability should be rejected in favor of a recognition that we cannot return to a status quo that we never truly left. <\/p>","type":"LONGFORM","cleanTitle":"Our Frightening Moment Was Years in the Making","createdAt":"2020-01-08T02:27:53.216Z","displayAt":null,"ledeCleanImage":null,"lock":null,"id":"35b0b7a5-c634-45f5-9dd2-c81e88efbde5","bodySource":"<p>We are one week into the 2020s and the last year of Donald Trump\u2019s first term, which will see both the third-ever impeachment trial for an American president and an election that is already wracking the country with anxiety.

In a <i>Politico<\/i> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/07/democratic-primary-2020-095090\">piece<\/a> Tuesday, reporter David Siders described an event for Biden in Iowa where the audience had already well internalized his warning that Trump\u2019s reelection would \u201cfundamentally change the character of the nation.\u201d<\/p><blockquote><p><span>At a Biden event at the minor league baseball stadium in Davenport, a man asked, \u201cCan America survive Trump in office for another year?\u201d<\/span><\/p><p><span>A collection of answers rang out from around the room: \u201cNo.\u201d And before Biden addressed the crowd, Scott County Supervisor Ken Croken cast the weight of the upcoming caucuses in equally somber terms.\u2026<\/span><\/p><p>He said, \u201cI fear that our democracy will not survive four more years of the imperial Trump presidency with his lack of understanding and respect for the Constitution.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote><p>It\u2019s fairly likely that no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election, and no matter what happens over the course of the next presidential term, the U.S. will exist at the end of 2024. Trump, obviously, has no respect for the norms that have governed his office, and his abuses of power have been deeply troubling. But the greatest extant threats to the functioning of American democracy today are structural\u2014the disproportionate and growing influence conservative regions hold in the Senate and electoral college, for instance\u2014or involve attempts to undermine the democratic process, including Republican efforts to strip the vote from African Americans. Biden has pledged to protect the vote but has also pledged, sincerely or not, to leave some of the major disparities in our political system untouched even if given the opportunity to reform them and even as they continue to confer power upon politicians who share Trump\u2019s beliefs and have been willing to tolerate his behavior. <\/p><p>That accrual of power, of course, would be aided significantly by a second Trump term. This, again, speaks to what is so structurally troubling about Trump as a political figure and his potential reelection. The Trump presidency, whenever it ends, will have done much not just to worsen the American political situation but also to set us further along the road that brought us to him to begin with\u2014and that may lead us to worse places still. As disorienting as any given moment in what remains of the Trump years may feel, promises for a return to comfortable stability should be rejected in favor of a recognition that we cannot return to a status quo that we never truly left. <\/p>","signal":null,"slug":"frightening-moment-years-making","updatedAt":"2020-01-08T17:46:35.041Z","ledeAltImage":null,"homepageTitle":null,"publishedAt":"2020-01-08T11:00:00.000Z","homepageSubheadline":null,"url":"/article/156149/frightening-moment-years-making","ledeImageCaption":"Jim Watson/Getty Images","galleries":[],"status":"PUBLISHED","meta":{"hideHeader":false,"wordCount":2182,"disableAds":false,"hideLede":false},"tags":[{"id":"c27ff6e6-b672-430d-be07-8a59b6f23383","label":"The Soapbox","slug":"the-soapbox"},{"id":"3046ee55-25d3-43cb-8491-58b17f8004d3","label":"Politics","slug":"politics"},{"id":"484e52db-a0f3-473d-9bdd-b198d777e655","label":"2020","slug":"2020"},{"id":"125d7c6a-623d-4502-89c0-7eb263e059e3","label":"Election 2020","slug":"election-2020"},{"id":"9ecbca02-2681-4228-b2cb-f9f19cda9fc9","label":"Donald Trump","slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"185edba6-82ea-4069-9828-db140c995dc7","label":"iran war","slug":"iran-war"},{"id":"897d4e77-45b7-43f9-9d42-863c47d53d5e","label":"-homepage-top","slug":"-homepage-top"}],"ledeImage":{"baseUrl":"//images.newrepublic.com/","src":"//images.newrepublic.com/6fd2b91550a1d2ba310d276097de2a537699707f.jpeg","width":5568,"format":"JPEG","id":"f06fc8b8-2db8-461b-bbaa-d91735a22110","isAnimated":false,"hash":"6fd2b91550a1d2ba310d276097de2a537699707f","height":3712,"meta":{}},"authors":[{"UserId":"9405e9e8-3e47-4e2b-aa34-a45852152628","name":"Osita Nwanevu","bio":"<p>Osita Nwanevu is a staff writer at <i>The New Republic<\/i>.<\/p>","id":"b4ca72fe-8581-495b-bff8-dd483bd810bf","title":"Staff Writer","blurb":"<p>Osita Nwanevu is a staff writer at <i>The New Republic<\/i>.<\/p>","slug":"osita-nwanevu","status":"INACTIVE","headshotImage":null,"meta":{"twitter":"OsitaNwanevu"}}]},{"sponsor":null,"deck":"A lying president and a timid Democratic opposition make for bad reporting and analysis.","bylines":null,"nid":156144,"urlFull":"https://newrepublic.com/article/156144/media-getting-wrong-soleimanis-killing","title":"What the Media Is Getting Wrong About Soleimani\u2019s Killing","body":"<p>What was the strategic goal of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to assassinate Iranian general Qassem Soleimani?

You might also have the impression that it did this because of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"/article/156113/iran-suleimani-bombing-iraq-airport-pinnacle-trumps-foreign-policy-stupidity\">decision to assassinate Qassem Soleimani<\/a>, the major general in charge of Iran\u2019s infamous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, last week. <i>The<\/i> <i>New York Times<\/i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-agreement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ran a headline<\/a> on Sunday declaring that \u201cIran Challenges Trump, Announcing End of Nuclear Restrictions.\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/5759088/iran-nuclear-deal-soleimani/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Time<\/i> magazine took things further<\/a>, declaring that \u201cIran Abandons 2015 Nuclear Deal Over U.S. Killing Gen. Soleimani.\u201d <\/p><p>Both missed the mark and sensationalized the truth. Iran did not leave the JCPOA or even suspend its compliance with all of the agreement\u2019s provisions. Iran remains a party to the deal\u2014for now\u2014and announced only that it will no longer observe the agreement\u2019s limitations on the number of centrifuges it is permitted to operate. (Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for civilian and military nuclear applications; the accord\u2019s provision was intended to put a ceiling on Iran\u2019s total capacity to produce enriched uranium.)<\/p><p>Nothing about Tehran\u2019s announcement, made on Sunday, indicates that Iran is about to build a bomb: Inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency remain in the country, watching. Critically, Tehran also remains a party to the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non\u2013nuclear weapon state, which bars it from building atomic arms. (Only four nations on earth have yet to sign the NPT: South Sudan, India, Pakistan, and Israel. <span>North Korea pulled out of the treaty in 2003.<\/span><span>)<\/span><\/p><p>The JCPOA not only made access to bomb-grade nuclear fuel\u2014both plutonium and uranium\u2014scarce for Iran but <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/19/06/gov2019-21.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ensured verification means<\/a> that would make it almost impossible for the nation to undertake a covert sprint to the bomb. Even as Iran violates the agreement\u2019s centrifuge provision, it has not transgressed what would be a major red line: expelling international inspectors. Such an action would block insights into Iran\u2019s civil nuclear activities, increasing the odds that fissile material could be diverted to a covert weapons program.<\/p><p>But beyond those specifics, it\u2019s dangerous to jump to the conclusion that Iran\u2019s weekend announcement had much at all to do with the U.S. strike on Soleimani. Despite all the sound and fury from Tehran about that attack, which has <a href=\"/article/156134/mike-pompeo-dangerous-man-world-right-now\">fueled one of the most ominous crises of the Trump era<\/a>, Sunday\u2019s declaration was eminently predictable.<\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The JCPOA is a 150-plus-page technical agreement, but its core bargain is a simple one. In exchange for agreeing to verified limits on its civil nuclear program, Iran won relief from punishing sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union, and the international community. (In addition to the U.S. and Iran, parties to the deal include China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the European Union.) But in May 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Trump administration reneged on the deal,<\/a> declaring that it would reimpose tough sanctions on Iran.<\/p><p>In response, Tehran announced last May\u2014exactly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">one year after Trump\u2019s 2018 renege<\/a>\u2014that it would cease <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-to-take-steps-to-reduce-its-commitment-to-landmark-nuclear-deal/2019/05/07/90cc3b1c-70fe-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">complying with the JCPOA\u2019s limits<\/a> on stockpiles of heavy water and enriched uranium. Sixty days later, Iran announced that it had exceeded JCPOA limits <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/02/iran-nuclear-deal-what-exceeding-irans-uranium-stockpile-limit-means.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">on enriched uranium<\/a>, then declared that it would begin producing uranium that was more enriched than the deal allowed.

You might also have the impression that it did this because of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156113/iran-suleimani-bombing-iraq-airport-pinnacle-trumps-foreign-policy-stupidity\">decision to assassinate Qassem Soleimani<\/a>, the major general in charge of Iran\u2019s infamous Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, last week. <i>The<\/i> <i>New York Times<\/i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-agreement.html\">ran a headline<\/a> on Sunday declaring that \u201cIran Challenges Trump, Announcing End of Nuclear Restrictions.\u201d <a href=\"https://time.com/5759088/iran-nuclear-deal-soleimani/\"><i>Time<\/i> magazine took things further<\/a>, declaring that \u201cIran Abandons 2015 Nuclear Deal Over U.S. Killing Gen. Soleimani.\u201d <\/p><p>Both missed the mark and sensationalized the truth. Iran did not leave the JCPOA or even suspend its compliance with all of the agreement\u2019s provisions. Iran remains a party to the deal\u2014for now\u2014and announced only that it will no longer observe the agreement\u2019s limitations on the number of centrifuges it is permitted to operate. (Centrifuges are used to enrich uranium for civilian and military nuclear applications; the accord\u2019s provision was intended to put a ceiling on Iran\u2019s total capacity to produce enriched uranium.)<\/p><p>Nothing about Tehran\u2019s announcement, made on Sunday, indicates that Iran is about to build a bomb: Inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency remain in the country, watching. Critically, Tehran also remains a party to the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non\u2013nuclear weapon state, which bars it from building atomic arms. (Only four nations on earth have yet to sign the NPT: South Sudan, India, Pakistan, and Israel. <span>North Korea pulled out of the treaty in 2003.<\/span><span>)<\/span><\/p><p>The JCPOA not only made access to bomb-grade nuclear fuel\u2014both plutonium and uranium\u2014scarce for Iran but <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/19/06/gov2019-21.pdf\">ensured verification means<\/a> that would make it almost impossible for the nation to undertake a covert sprint to the bomb. Even as Iran violates the agreement\u2019s centrifuge provision, it has not transgressed what would be a major red line: expelling international inspectors. Such an action would block insights into Iran\u2019s civil nuclear activities, increasing the odds that fissile material could be diverted to a covert weapons program.<\/p><p>But beyond those specifics, it\u2019s dangerous to jump to the conclusion that Iran\u2019s weekend announcement had much at all to do with the U.S. strike on Soleimani. Despite all the sound and fury from Tehran about that attack, which has <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156134/mike-pompeo-dangerous-man-world-right-now\">fueled one of the most ominous crises of the Trump era<\/a>, Sunday\u2019s declaration was eminently predictable.<\/p><hr class=\"section-break\"><p>The JCPOA is a 150-plus-page technical agreement, but its core bargain is a simple one. In exchange for agreeing to verified limits on its civil nuclear program, Iran won relief from punishing sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union, and the international community. (In addition to the U.S. and Iran, parties to the deal include China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the European Union.) But in May 2018, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html\">the Trump administration reneged on the deal,<\/a> declaring that it would reimpose tough sanctions on Iran.<\/p><p>In response, Tehran announced last May\u2014exactly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html\">one year after Trump\u2019s 2018 renege<\/a>\u2014that it would cease <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-to-take-steps-to-reduce-its-commitment-to-landmark-nuclear-deal/2019/05/07/90cc3b1c-70fe-11e9-9331-30bc5836f48e_story.html\">complying with the JCPOA\u2019s limits<\/a> on stockpiles of heavy water and enriched uranium.

They found that in\nBrooklyn and Queens, the people funneled into the courts reflected the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-arrests-nyc-race.html\">racial\nprofiling<\/a> police engage in with other arrests: 69 percent of defendants facing\nprostitution charges in Brooklyn were black, and in Queens, 58 percent were\nEast Asian. They also pointed out that the \u201cservices\u201d offered by these intervention courts<b>&nbsp;<\/b>were inadequate to\nhelp even someone who did want to leave sex work, while the arrests\nrevictimized the same people the courts said they were saving.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Presenting the RedUP findings before the New York City Council in 2015, organizer Jenna Torres <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/why-do-sex-work-diversion-programs-fail/\">described<\/a> how, after a prostitution arrest, she had to choose between her college education, caring for her young children, or showing up to the required sessions so she wouldn\u2019t be arrested again. By the time she \u201csuccessfully\u201d completed the program, she said, she had dropped out of what would have been her first semester of school.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Though these warnings received <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xjj59/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims\">some<\/a>\namount of <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/why-do-sex-work-diversion-programs-fail/\">coverage<\/a>\nat the time, there was little public response, if any, from the courts. They\nstayed the course, with the then chief judge of New York state pitching the trafficking courts as a model to replicate nationally at a <a href=\"https://nydailyrecord.com/2015/10/09/chief-judge-opens-human-trafficking-summit/\">summit<\/a>\nalongside <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/154119/white-moms-burden\">beer&nbsp;heiress and anti-trafficking crusader<\/a>&nbsp;Cindy McCain and several anti\u2013sex work groups. Several years later,\na team of researchers at Yale\u2019s Global Health Justice Partnership issued a\n<a href=\"https://theappeal.org/inside-ny-courts-where-sex-workers-are-painted-as-victims-and-treated-as-criminals/\">report<\/a>\non the trafficking courts, and it echoed what RedUP had found before: that the courts further harmed&nbsp;the people they claimed to help and failed to live up to their promises.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t\nactually know enough about what they are doing to say if they are succeeding or\nfailing,\u201d Alice Miller, co-director of the GHJP and lead contributor to the\nreport, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/inside-ny-courts-where-sex-workers-are-painted-as-victims-and-treated-as-criminals/\">told<\/a>\nme at the time. Still, the courts have not responded with data of their own. (Nor, the <i>Times<\/i> reaffirmed in its reporting this week, does the state even collect data on what happens to the people who\ngo through the courts.)<\/p><p>\u201cAs long as over-policing of the poor along lines of race and gender, coupled with criminalization of buying and selling sex, are the context in which these courts operate,\u201d the&nbsp;GHJP&nbsp;researchers concluded, \u201cthey cannot stop the revolving door of criminalization.\u201d<\/p><p>You can see this\nespecially at play in how supporters of trafficking courts claim they represent\na new, compassionate way of looking at women in the sex trade.
