You’re taking away people’s rights as human beings,” he continued. “That whole dictatorship mentality is being perpetuated by the president.”</p><p>Those comments came just one day after Alabama’s Republican governor Kay Ivey signed into law the most restrictive abortion measure in the country. The legislation, which has been <a class href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celebrities-react-alabama-abortion-law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized by Hollywood celebrities</a>, <a class href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/democrats-respond-to-passage-of-alabama-abortion-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Democratic activists</a> and even by <a class href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/444056-house-gop-leader-says-alabama-abortion-ban-goes-further-than-i-believe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Republican House leadership</a>, makes performing an abortion a felony carrying harsh prison sentences, with few exceptions.</p><p>Common, who has <a class href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/common-on-trump-the-abortion-debate-and-why-rap-scares-people-59335749823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoken out previously</a> about his own personal experience with a romantic partner who had an abortion, pledged to fight to overturn the legislation and said he would redouble his efforts to help elect new leaders into office across the state.</p><p>“It’s up to us now to say this person should not be elected again,” he said. “We’ve got to galvanize. We are going to put candidates in that understand that choice is a human right.”</p><p>Common’s comments came as part of an interview with <em>Mic</em> about his new book, “<a class href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074ZQJ65T/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Let Love Have the Last Word: A Memoir</a>,” a candid new memoir published this month in which the rapper opens up about his personal experiences with topics such as love, mindfulness, and self-care.</p><p>The book covers a range of subjects, from spirituality, love, and intimacy, to family and community, and details Common’s personal journey which has led him to embrace love in his own life. One of the book’s core messages is a call to fellow activists to work on their own well-being and mental health as they seek to help others.</p><p>“For people who do have a desire to help others, a lot of times we put our energy towards that and forget about making sure that we take care of ourselves,” he said. “The way you can truly be the best activist is to make sure that you are taking care of yourself in the process.”</p><p>Throughout the book, Common discusses a range of difficult and taboo subjects, many of which he previously has not talked openly about, including <a class href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/common-says-he-was-molested-family-friend-child-n1003466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own sexual abuse</a> and his experience working through trauma in therapy. Talking about these subjects openly, he hopes, will help to break stigmas which persist around mental health issues, particularly in the black community.</p><p>“I’ve had elders say we don’t need to do that,” he said. “But I felt how much better I was becoming by using therapy [and] I want other people to have that access. For people who think that’s weird or you feel embarrassed about it, some of the most successful people you know do this.”</p><p>In addition to <a class href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7964741/common-emmy-win-letter-to-the-free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar</a> winning musician and actor, Common is also a leading social justice activist and commentator; last year, <em>Mic </em>profiled the rapper’s visit to several prisons across California as he advocated for criminal justice reform across the state.</p><div class="fS"><div class="fb-post ke" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=335677117249565" data-width="auto" data-show-text></div></div><p>Common says he sees the face of a new generation of activists who are working to change their communities in his own daughter, who recently graduated from Howard University.</p><p>“A lot of the movement that I grew up around was hip-hop based.
