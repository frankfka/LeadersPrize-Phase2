But any case centered around an abortion regulation could be a vehicle for the Supreme Court to redefine the constitutional standards, according to Corbin. </p><p>The 1992 case <em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Casey v. Planned Parenthood</a></em> shows how the Supreme Court has already shifted those standards once before. The framework for evaluating the constitutionality of an abortion restriction under <em>Roe </em>had been based on trimester, but the <em>Casey </em>decision imposed a new standard centered around the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/cover_story/2016/03/how_the_undue_burden_concept_eroded_roe_v_wade.html?via=gdpr-consent" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">concept of an &quot;undue burden.&quot;</a> Defined as a &quot;substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability,&quot; the &quot;undue burden&quot; principle blurred the lines of what regulations could be deemed unconstitutional.</p><p>So while <em>Casey</em> reaffirmed the right to an abortion by upholding the basic tenants of <em>Roe</em>, it also paved the way for the <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/overview-abortion-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">onslaught of restrictions</a> that now require women in certain states to endure waiting periods, receive counseling, or get an ultrasound before obtaining an abortion.</p><div class="fS"><div class="nV"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/NARAL/status/1013505276677419008"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>The 2016 <em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2015/15-274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt</a></em> decision later broadened what qualified as an &quot;undue burden.&quot; But a future ruling from the Supreme Court could move things in the opposite direction: For example, if the Supreme Court ruled that legislation banning abortion at the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/iowas-new-abortion-law-is-officially-the-most-restrictive-ban-in-the-country-8997431">sign of a heartbeat</a> was constitutional, states would be able to ban abortion at six weeks — before most women even know they're pregnant. Such a ruling would effectively outlaw abortion without the court ever having to declare that it's unconstitutional. </p><p>Of course, no one knows what the future holds. But whether the court chooses to get rid of <em>Roe</em> entirely or slowly dismantle it, either move would &quot;erode decades of precedent and could have an enormous impact on the real-world ability of women to be able to access health care,&quot; says Genevieve Scott, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. </p><p>That's why, she says, &quot;it is absolutely critical that the Senate ensures that Anthony Kennedy be replaced with a justice who will affirm the fundamental rights of all.&quot;</p></div></div></article></div><div class="I"><input id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox" class="L" /><label for="navCheckbox" class="J"></label><nav class="K"><label for="navCheckbox" class="X"><span></span></label><div class="M"><i class="N"></i></div><div class="O"><a href="/news" class="P">News</a><a href="/entertainment" class="P">Entertainment</a><a href="/beauty" class="P">Beauty</a><a href="/fashion" class="P">Fashion</a><a href="/lifestyle" class="P">Lifestyle</a><a href="/flowcharts" class="P">Flowcharts</a><a href="/books" class="P">Books</a><a href="/tech" class="P">Tech</a><a href="/food" class="P">Food</a><a href="/wellness" class="P">Wellness</a><a href="/features" class="P">Features</a></div><div class="Q"><a href="https://bustle.company/" class="R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About Us</a><a href="https://bustle.company/advertise" class="R">Advertise</a><a href="/apps" class="R">Apps</a><a href="/labs" class="R">Labs</a><a href="/tos" class="R">Terms</a><a href="/privacy" class="R">Privacy</a><a href="/dmca" class="R">DMCA</a><a href="/contact" class="R">Contact Us</a></div><div class="S fE"><a class="T" href="https://www.facebook.com/bustledotcom/" title="Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fy"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://twitter.com/bustle" title="Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fz"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://www.pinterest.com/bustledotcom/" title="Pinterest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fA"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://www.instagram.com/bustle/" title="Instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fB"></i></a><a class="T" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/bustle/id1019829583?mt=2" title="Podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class="U fC"></i></a></div><div class="V"><span class="W">®</span> 2018 Bustle</div></nav></div><noscript><img src="https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif" /><img src="https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&amp;c2=17519299&amp;cs_ucfr=0&amp;cv=2.0&amp;cj=1" /><img src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1" /></noscript></div> <script>
