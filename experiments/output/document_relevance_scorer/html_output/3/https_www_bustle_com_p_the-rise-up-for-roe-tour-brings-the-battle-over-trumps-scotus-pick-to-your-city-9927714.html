Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he plans to schedule Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings for September or October. Organizers of the Rise Up For Roe tour hope to gin up enough public pressure from women voters to block his confirmation before then.</p><p>&quot;People are outraged that men in power keep putting their health and rights on the chopping block,&quot; Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood's executive vice president, says in a statement to Bustle. &quot;Senators need to be listening these voices.
