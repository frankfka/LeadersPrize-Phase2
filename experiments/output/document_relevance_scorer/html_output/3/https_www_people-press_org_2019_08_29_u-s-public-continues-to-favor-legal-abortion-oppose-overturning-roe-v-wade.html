A smaller share of the public (38%) says abortion should be illegal in all (12%) or most cases (26%).</p>
<p>The new survey by Pew Research Center, conducted July 22-August 4 among 4,175 adults, also finds little support for overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that established a woman’s right to an abortion. Seven-in-ten say they do not want to see the Roe v. Wade decision completely overturned; 28% say they would like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn the 1973 decision.</p>
<p>Consistent with these views, a majority of Americans say their greater concern is that some states are making it too difficult (59%) rather than too easy (39%) for people to be able to get an abortion.</p>

<p>Results for this report are based on a survey conducted through Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel – a probability-based, nationally representative panel of U.S. adults administered online. Two of the questions on this survey have been included on telephone surveys in the past.</p>
<p>Results from self-administered (online) and interviewer-administered (telephone) surveys are<br />
sometimes different even when the questions are worded the same. This difference is called a mode effect.</p>
<p>To assess possible mode effects in abortion attitudes, the two questions with previous phone trends were included on a recent telephone survey in addition to this wave of the American Trends Panel. The two surveys produced similar estimates for these two abortion attitudes. Results for both surveys are shown in the topline.</p>
<p>Charts in the report that draw upon trend data from telephone surveys include footnotes indicating the mode of data collection.

<p>Democrats broadly back access to legal abortion: About eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (82%) say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A somewhat larger share of liberal (91%) than conservative and moderate (75%) Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.</p>
<p>Democrats are ideologically divided over how far protections for legal abortion should extend: Conservative and moderate Democrats are more likely to say abortion should be legal in <em>most</em> cases (45%) than in <em>all </em>cases (30%). The balance of opinion is reversed among liberal Democrats: 51% say abortion should be legal in all cases, while 39% say it should be legal in most cases.</p>

Republicans are deeply split on this question by ideology: 77% of conservative Republicans say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases; just 22% say it should be legal. By contrast, 57% of moderate and liberal Republicans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, compared with a smaller share (41%) who say it should be illegal.</p>
<p>When it comes to abortion policy, the public expresses somewhat more agreement with the Democratic Party’s policies than those of the Republican Party – though a sizable minority says they don’t agree with either party’s policies.</p>

<p>Overall, 42% agree with the Democratic Party’s policies on abortion either strongly (28%) or somewhat (15%). A smaller share (32%) says they strongly (21%) or somewhat (11%) agree with the policies of the GOP. About a quarter (24%) says they don’t agree with either party on this issue.</p>
<p>Most partisans agree with their own party’s stance on abortion policy, but moderates in both parties are especially likely to express some doubts about their own party’s policies on abortion.</p>
<p>Among Republicans and Republican leaners, 64% agree with the GOP’s stance on abortion, while 23% say they do not agree with either party and 12% say they agree with the Democratic Party’s policies. About eight-in-ten conservative Republicans (81%) agree with the GOP on abortion policy, compared with just 41% of moderate and liberal Republicans. A majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (59%) do not agree with either party (35%) or agree with the Democratic Party (24%) on abortion policy.</p>
<p>Seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners say they agree with their own party on abortion policy; 22% say they do not agree with either party and just 7% agree with the GOP. Liberal Democrats (85%) are much more likely than conservatives and moderates (57%) to agree with the Democratic Party’s policies on abortion. Roughly a third of conservatives and moderates (32%) say they do not agree with either party’s policies; 9% say they agree with the GOP.</p>

And the growing partisan gap has been driven largely by an increase in support for legal abortion among Democrats.</p>
<p>In the current survey, Democrats and Democratic leaners are 46 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases (82% vs. 36%). This gap is wider than it has been in previous Pew Research Center surveys dating to 2007. For instance, in 2016, there was a 33-point gap between the shares of Democrats (72%) and Republicans (39%) who supported legal abortion in all or most cases.</p>
<p>Differences in views on legal abortion extend beyond party affiliation; there are significant divides in views on the basis of religious affiliation, education and age. Notably, there are virtually no differences in the opinions of women and men.</p>

The parties agree that any breach of the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement by User will result in irreparable damage to the Center for which it will have no adequate remedy at law.  Therefore, it is agreed that the Center shall be entitled to equitable relief, including an injunction enjoining any such breach by any court of competent jurisdiction.  Such injunction shall be without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which the Center may be entitled, including but not limited to any damages resulting from User\u2019s breach of the confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.  Any failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall not operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n\tC.\tUser will immediately notify the Center and cooperate with investigations, and provide any information reasonably requested by the Center if User knows of or suspects any breach of security or potential vulnerability of the Data and will promptly remedy such breach.\n\n\tIV.\tIndemnification. User shall indemnify and hold harmless the Center, its affiliates and related organizations, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, legal representatives, agents, successors and assigns, from and against any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and professionals\u2019 fees and court costs arising out of any third-party claims based on (a) User\u2019s access or use of the Data; (b) any changes made by User to the Data in accordance with this Agreement; or (c) any breach by User of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n\tV.\tTermination.
