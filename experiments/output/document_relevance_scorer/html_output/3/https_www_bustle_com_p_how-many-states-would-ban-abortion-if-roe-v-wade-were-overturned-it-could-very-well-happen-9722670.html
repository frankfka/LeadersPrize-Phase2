For some, this is because so-called &quot;trigger laws&quot; are in place. These laws would immediately make abortion illegal in their respective states as soon as Roe v Wade were overturned. These states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, <a class="gs" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</a> </p><p>Back in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump said that, if he were given the opportunity to appoint a few Supreme Court justices, he believed that<em> Roe v.

Several other states still have pre-<em>Roe</em> abortion bans on their books, even though they are not being followed. If<em> Roe v. Wade </em>is overturned, it's feasible that those anti-abortion laws could become active again. </p><p>And, notably, they're not just the right-leaning states that you might expect. According to Guttmacher, the blue bastion of Massachusetts stands among states like Arkansas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma when it comes to keeping pre-<em>Roe</em> abortion bans in place.</p><p>&quot;There’s no way to sugarcoat it: with this nomination, the constitutional right to access safe, legal abortion in this country is on the line,&quot; Dawn Laguens, Executive Vice President, Planned Parenthood Federation of America <a class="gs" href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/senate-must-reject-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement following Trump's announcement </a>Monday night. &quot;We already know how Brett Kavanaugh would rule on <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, because the president told us so. We take Trump at his word that Brett Kavanaugh would overturn <em>Roe v. Wade </em>and get rid of the Affordable Care Act.&quot;</p><p>One of the greatest challenges before those who would seek to see abortion ban is setting up a legal challenge that would wind its way through the court system and find itself on the Supreme Court docket. However, reports indicate that these efforts are well underway. </p><p>&quot;[W]e are focusing right now on two specific types of abortion bans,&quot; Denise Burke, senior counsel for the anti-choice group Alliance Defending Freedom, <a class="gs" href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/adf-plans-first-trimester-abortion-restrictions-then-total-bans-as-it-fights-roe-in-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at the Evangelicals for Life conference</a> in January. &quot;So we’re not looking at regulation, we’re actually looking to enact abortion bans.&quot;</p><div class="gE"><div class="nX"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/PPact/status/1016764021427621891"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>Burke described the wave of efforts to enact 15-week abortion bans as a &quot;bait&quot; for challenges that might make their way up to the Supreme Court. &quot;We’re kind of basically baiting them—come on, fight us on turf that we have already set up and established,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;<a class="gs" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/10/627666535/if-high-court-reverses-roe-v-wade-22-states-likely-to-ban-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's not a question of if</a>; it's a question of what or when,&quot;  Sarah Lipton-Lubet, vice president for reproductive health and rights at the National Partnership for Women and Families, told Kaiser Health News on Tuesday. </p><p>It's difficult to know exactly how many states would move to make abortion illegal if given the chance, or precisely how quickly they would move, but abortion rights advocates <a class="gs" href="https://khn.org/news/if-high-court-reverses-roe-v-wade-22-states-are-likely-to-ban-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimate that nearly 22 </a>would make the leap.
