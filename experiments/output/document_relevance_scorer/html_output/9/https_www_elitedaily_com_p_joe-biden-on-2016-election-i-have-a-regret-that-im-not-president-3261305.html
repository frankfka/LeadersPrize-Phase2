I think America is so incredibly well-positioned."</p><p>The former vice president served eight years in the Obama administration and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senators-pay-tribute-to-joe-bidens-36-years-of-service_us_5848c013e4b0993459621f62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36 years in the U.S. Senate</a>, so he was more than qualified for the presidency.

</div><p>Biden's heart and soul were understandably not invested in the presidency, considering he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost his 46-year-old son Beau</a> to brain cancer in May, just months before he would have to announce his run for presidency. Biden gave a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/21/joe-biden-not-running-president-2016-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">White House address in October 2015</a> about his decision saying, “As my family and I have worked through the grieving process. I’ve said all along that it may very well be that that process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president." In terms of his opportunity to run, Biden "concluded it has closed.”</p><p>While Biden is still confident in his choice not to run for president, he has made his disapproval of Trump's tactics and rhetoric very clear. Just yesterday, Nov. 8, Biden spoke at an Axios event in Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/08/joe-biden-donald-trump-244708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming Trump had “phony nationalism</a>." Biden also said Trump's rhetoric when talking about the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August was “eating at the fabric at this country.”</p><p>Biden and Trump have also <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/10/biden-and-trump-are-talking-about-fighting-each-other.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoken publicly about beating each other up</a>, as if they were in high school. While campaigning for Clinton at Pennsylvania rally in October 2016, Biden said, "No, I wish were in high school and I could take him behind the gym.” To which Trump responded a few days later at rally in Florida saying, "Did you see where Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn?. I’d love that. I’d love that. Mr. Tough Guy. He’s Mr. Tough Guy."</p><p>His public dismissal of Trump is just one reason many Americans love this "tough guy." Another reason is the viral "bromance" between Obama and Biden that has been a lasting joke even after they both left the White House. The memes of Obama and Biden being best friends was simply an adorable escape for many saddened Democrats as the pair departed the White House.</p><div class="bA"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your service has been a great gift to the country, and your friendship and brotherhood are a great gift to me.

</div><p>Biden's interview with Oprah has sparked some curiosity about his possible run for president in 2020. Combining his "regrets" about the presidency and America's potential, along with his anti-Trump agenda has got people raising their eyebrows about the possibility. Just two days, Biden told a Salt Lake City audience on Monday, Nov. 6 that the "<a href="http://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/11/07/honest-to-god-joe-biden-tells-utah-i-dont-know-whether-to-run-for-president-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">honest to God answer is that I don’t know,"</a> in reference to him running. Whether or not he is running is clearly unknown, but let's hope for all the Biden-loving Democrats that he is not giving false hope.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div></div></article></div></div><div class="bj"><input id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox" autoComplete="off" class="bm" /><label for="navCheckbox" class="bk"></label><nav class="bl"><label for="navCheckbox" class="br"></label><ul class="bn"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/fashion-beauty">Fashion &amp; Beauty</a></li><li><a href="/news">News</a></li><li><a href="/entertainment">Entertainment</a></li><li><a href="/life">Life</a></li><li><a href="/dating">Dating</a></li><li><a href="/video">Video</a></li></ul><ul class="bo"><li><a href="https://bustle.company/">Company</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="/terms">Terms</a></li><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li><li><div class="bq"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="aJ"><i class="aR"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/EliteDaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="aJ"><i class="aS"></i></a><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/elitedaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="aJ"><i class="aT"></i></a><a href="https://instagram.com/elitedaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="aJ"><i class="aQ"></i></a><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ex-games/id1259344899?mt=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="aJ"><i class="aP"></i></a></div></li></ul></nav></div></div> <script>__INITIAL_STATE__ = {"id":"3261305","type":"ARTICLE","title":"Joe Biden On 2016 Election: \"I Have A Regret That I'm Not President\"","clipTitle":"Joe Biden Tells Oprah He Regrets He's Not The President \u0026 Same","path":"/p/joe-biden-on-2016-election-i-have-a-regret-that-im-not-president-3261305","url":"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/joe-biden-on-2016-election-i-have-a-regret-that-im-not-president-3261305","rating":"NSFA","publishedAt":1510242402430,"updatedAt":1510242407670,"bodies":[{"version":"0.3.1","atoms":[],"cards":[["embed-card",{"type":"tweet","key":"uploads/image/2017/11/9/9d7e9f42-07c1-476b-a298-d661e8875683-domvqs9vwaatwhp.jpg","attribution_url":"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/928609816485945345","attribution":"ABC News on Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/928609816485945345","provider_name":"Twitter","width":720,"height":720,"html":"\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eFormer VP Biden on not running for president: “Was I prepared to be able to give my whole heart…I knew I wasn’t.” \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/OM5cKJZ5x4\"\u003ehttps://t.co/OM5cKJZ5x4\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/ikOMbFMBsr\"\u003epic.twitter.com/ikOMbFMBsr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; ABC News (@ABC) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/928609816485945345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eNovember 9, 2017\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n","ratio":1,"__hash__":439121250,"_v":1}],["embed-card",{"type":"tweet","key":"uploads/image/2017/11/9/83436161-d4ed-4d64-9ddf-f69928ba216c-dgzfnxaxkai4amc.jpg:large","attribution_url":"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/893478138822479872","attribution":"Joe Biden on Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/893478138822479872","provider_name":"Twitter","width":1500,"height":1000,"html":"\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eYour service has been a great gift to the country, and your friendship and brotherhood are a great gift to me.
