The fan-favorite photo is pretty much guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. </p><p>On Saturday, President Barack Obama made a rare exception to his no selfies policy by sharing a photo taken with his longtime running mate and right hand partner: Joe Biden. ICYMI, the former Vice President has been <a class href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOqBf2UAmJq/?taken-by=vp44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIA from Instagram since Dec. 30 2016</a>, when he took to @VP44 to share a photo of himself boarding a C-17 plane. That finally changed on Thursday, Sept. 6 when he created a new Instagram account (@JoeBiden) and shared his first post. None other than longtime BFF President Obama took note, taking to his own account to <a class href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BneQYW7nhkb/?taken-by=barackobama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">welcome Biden back to the social media platform</a>. </p><p>&quot;My brother and friend <a class href="https://www.instagram.com/JoeBiden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JoeBiden</a> is back on Instagram,&quot; he wrote alongside a photo of the friends cheesing for the camera. &quot;Welcome back, Joe—you'll always be one of the rare exceptions to my no-selfies rule.&quot;</p><div class="bP"><div class="iG"><div class="iH" style="padding-top:75%;padding-bottom:157px"></div><blockquote class="instagram-media iF" data-instgrm-captioned><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BneQYW7nhkb/"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>If the chummy shot looks familiar, it's because it's a re-share from another now iconic BROTUS moment: When the <a class href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/this-video-of-barack-obama-joe-biden-getting-lunch-proves-this-bromance-is-forever-9946137">pair stepped out together for lunch</a> on Monday, July 30 at the Dog Tag Bakery in Washington D.C. and were the epitome of #FriendshipGoals.</p><p>Biden <a class href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/joe-bidens-birthday-wish-to-barack-obama-is-so-emotional-im-crying-9998484">shared the photo on Aug. 4</a> in honor of President Obama's birthday, and his genuine caption was enough to move everyone to tears.</p><p>&quot;Our lunches together were a highlight of every week at the White House,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Last week's trip to <a class href="https://twitter.com/DogTagBakery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DogTagBakery</a> was no different.

Now I'm just crossing my fingers that the former POTUS finds many more opportunities to bend his no-selfies rule. </p><p>President Obama wasn't the only one out of Biden's 624,000 followers and counting to take note. Former White House photographer Pete Souza (who memorably <a class href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/pete-souza-wished-barack-obama-happy-birthday-with-a-post-that-shaded-trump-9998153">penned an epic birthday message for President Obama</a> that simultaneously managed to shade President Trump) also got on board the welcome train.</p><p>&quot;Great to see <a class href="https://www.instagram.com/JoeBiden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@JoeBiden</a> back on Instagram!&quot; Souza wrote alongside a candid of the former running mates sharing a laugh. &quot;P.S.
