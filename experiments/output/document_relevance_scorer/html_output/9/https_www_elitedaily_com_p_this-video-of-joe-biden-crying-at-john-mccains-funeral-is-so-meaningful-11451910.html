The life and legacy of McCain was honored with several events spanning from Wednesday, Aug. 29 to Saturday, Sept. 1. On Thursday, Aug. 30, family, friends, and colleagues gathered in Phoenix, Arizona to pay respects to the late senator. Among those in attendance was former Vice President Joe Biden, who eulogized his longtime friend. This <a class href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-mccain-s-longtime-friendship-be-display-memorial-service-n904966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video of Joe Biden crying at John McCain's funeral</a> is so meaningful. </p><p>Biden and McCain had been friends since they served as colleagues in the Senate for nearly two decades, before the two ran on opposite tickets in the 2008 elections. Their friendship, though, was not hindered by the party divide.

While discussing funeral plans, Rick Davis, McCain's former campaign manager, even told NBC News that Biden “is being treated as a member of a family.&quot; </p><p>Biden took the podium in Phoenix and said, &quot;My name's Joe Biden, I'm a Democrat and I love John McCain.&quot; Which could not be a more perfect description of how their friendship survived and thrived despite their party affiliations. &quot;We were both filled with dreams and amsbtions and an overwhelming desire to make the time we had their worthwhile,&quot; said Biden. He then went on to deliver an emotional speech about McCain, how they met, their friendship, and the shared pain of losing him. </p><p>Watch Biden pay tribute to his dear friend here: </p><div class="B"><div class="ir"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/TODAYshow/status/1035223369858338816"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>Among the people also<a class href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/404220-palin-not-invited-to-mccain-funeral-services-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> paying tribute to McCain</a> are former President Barack Obama and former President George W.
