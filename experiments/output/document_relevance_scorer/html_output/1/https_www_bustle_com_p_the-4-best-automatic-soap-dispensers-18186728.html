When looking for the <a class="iT" href="https://fitzgeraldmuseum.net/top-10-best-automatic-soap-dispensers-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best automatic soap dispensers</a>, there are a few key factors to consider.</p><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether you prefer a model that's rechargeable or one that uses batteries. Both are manageable, though some rechargeable options last up to three months on one charge while some battery options can last as long as two years. With the latter type, it's important to think about the battery compartment's location and design. If it's located on the base of the dispenser, it should be raised so it's not flush with your counter, and it should have a waterproof seal; this will help prevent battery corrosion.</p><p>Another thing to consider is whether you want a foaming dispenser. These typically use less soap per pump, making it last longer. Some people may prefer the texture of foam to liquid when washing their hands, too. The downside is that some models require special soap (though, I've included a pick below that's compatible with any type of soap). Also, if you're worried about the amount that's dispensed, look for options that allow you to adjust the dispensed-soap volume.</p><p>One other important aspect for any automatic soap dispenser is the valve. The best dispensers have a valve that seals tightly after use, so you're not constantly mopping up wasted soap. Silicone is a reliable material for this, but not all manufacturers disclose their valve material. In any case, when selecting the picks below, I sifted through hundreds of Amazon reviews to confirm — silicone or not — that the seals were tight and there no complaints of leaking soap. </p><p>To help you find the perfect addition to your <a class="iT" href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/188855-12-best-shower-gadgets-bathroom-accessories-that-are-actually-useful">bathroom essentials</a>, I've compiled a list of the best automatic soap dispenser below. </p><div class="iZ"><h3 class="i_">1.

The automatic pump dispenses in an impressive 0.2 second, and you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out to suit your preference. The transparent, 8-ounce soap receptacle makes it easy to see when it's time to refill. Battery-powered, this dispenser can last up to a year on a single set of four double A batteries (which aren't included). And while the battery-compartment is located on the bottom of the dispenser, fans say that it's slightly raised, which helps keep water out and prevent corrosion.</p><p><strong>What fans say: &quot;</strong>I bought five of these back in 2015 for my house. All are still fully functional 4 years later, no issues. I highly recommend them if you’re looking for an automatic soap dispenser.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="iZ"><h3 class="i_">2.

It features an infrared sensor that's super sensitive, and it also offers two different volume levels so you can choose how much soap comes out at a time. While some foam soap dispensers require special soap, this pick can turn any liquid soap into foam — just mix it with a one-to-three ratio of water. Though the manufacturer doesn't disclose the valve's material, the reviews are very positive, with a 4.3-star rating after hundreds of reviews. </p><p>Designed with a waterproof base and also wall-mountable, this pick runs on four AA batteries, which you'll have to purchase separately.

It's designed with the battery compartment on the top, according to reviewers, and it can last up to two years with one set of six AA batteries, which are included.</p><p><strong>What fans say: &quot;</strong>This soap dispenser is great. I had a different one with the batteries in the bottom. Batteries got soap after the first few uses.

Both are manageable, though some rechargeable options last up to three months on one charge while some battery options can last as long as two years. With the latter type, it's important to think about the battery compartment's location and design. If it's located on the base of the dispenser, it should be raised so it's not flush with your counter, and it should have a waterproof seal; this will help prevent battery corrosion."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Another thing to consider is whether you want a foaming dispenser. These typically use less soap per pump, making it last longer. Some people may prefer the texture of foam to liquid when washing their hands, too. The downside is that some models require special soap (though, I've included a pick below that's compatible with any type of soap). Also, if you're worried about the amount that's dispensed, look for options that allow you to adjust the dispensed-soap volume."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"One other important aspect for any automatic soap dispenser is the valve. The best dispensers have a valve that seals tightly after use, so you're not constantly mopping up wasted soap. Silicone is a reliable material for this, but not all manufacturers disclose their valve material. In any case, when selecting the picks below, I sifted through hundreds of Amazon reviews to confirm — silicone or not — that the seals were tight and there no complaints of leaking soap.
