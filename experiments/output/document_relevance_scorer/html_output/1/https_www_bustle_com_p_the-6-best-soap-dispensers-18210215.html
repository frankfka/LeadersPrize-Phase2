There are three key traits I looked for when compiling my list:</p><ol><li><strong>Durable materials:</strong> You don't want to spend time picking out the perfect soap dispenser only to have it break a few days later. Whether it's glass, ceramic, porcelain, or even plastic, all of my picks below can stand up to daily wear and the occasional mishap, according to reviewers.</li><li><strong>High-quality pump: </strong>There's nothing more annoying than a cheap soap pump that's prone to sticking, clogging, or, worst of all, shooting soap across the room. I looked for options that are constructed with a smooth pump that reviewers say distributes soap evenly into your hand each time.</li><li><strong>Easy installation: </strong>If you're considering a wall-mounted dispenser, you'll need to think about installation. Below, you'll find that the mountable picks on my list are easy to set up and don't involve any screws, drills, or complicated hardware.  </li></ol><p>In addition to these functional elements, you'll want to think about the aesthetics. After all, if you don't like the way it looks, you won't want it sitting on your counter. All of my picks feature attractive designs and neutral color schemes to ensure they won't clash with your existing decor.

The popular gadget, which has more than 1,100 reviews on Amazon, works quickly and efficiently — you won't waste time waving your hands around or waiting forever for the soap to come out. It's made from durable, water-resistant materials with a clean, noncaking design. Battery-operated, the battery compartment is conveniently located on the back of the dispenser (instead of on the bottom, which is a common design flaw with cheaper models). Best of all, it has a switch you can use to adjust how much soap comes out at once. </p><p><strong>What fans say: </strong>&quot;I LOVE this dispenser. It holds quite a bit of soap. Love how you can change the amount of soap it dispenses so no waste with the little hands. 😊 The fact that you can wall mount it is an added bonus. The container is clear so whatever color your soap is will be part of your bathroom color scheme. I also like the fact that the sensor is NOT SUPER sensitive that you can clean under it without soap constantly coming out.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="jk"><h3 class="jl">3.
