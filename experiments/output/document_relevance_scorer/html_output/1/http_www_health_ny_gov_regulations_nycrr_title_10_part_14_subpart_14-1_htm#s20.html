<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<h3 id="s1">Section 14-1.1 Purpose.</h3>
<p>The purpose of this code is to protect the public health. Owners and operators of food service establishments are to operate their premises in such a way as to avoid imminent health hazards. Health hazards in operation, when called to their attention by the representative of the permit-issuing official, are to be corrected immediately. Deficiencies, other than imminent health hazards, such as poor sanitary practices, are to be corrected in accordance with a schedule approved by the permit-issuing official.</p>
<h2 id="hazards">Public Health Hazards</h2>
<h3 id="s10">14-1.10 Definition of imminent health hazard.</h3>
<ul class="none">
<li>(a) An imminent health hazard is any violation, combination of violations, condition or combination of conditions making it probable that the food or drink served to the public by the establishment or its continued operation can injure the health of the consumer or the public. Imminent health hazards include but are not limited to the conditions listed in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section.</li>
<li>(b) Any of the following five violations are imminent health hazards against the public interest which require the permit-issuing official or his designated representative to order the establishment closed and all service of food stopped immediately, if not corrected at the time of the inspection while the permit-issuing official or representative of the permit-issuing official is on the premises:
<ul class="none">
<li>(1) food is present in the establishment from an unapproved or unknown source or which is or may be adulterated, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption;</li>
<li>(2) potentially hazardous food is held for a period longer than that necessary for preparation or service at a temperature greater than 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7.2 degrees Celsius) or less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius);</li>
<li>(3) potentially hazardous food exposed to consumer or other contamination is served again;</li>
<li>(4) toxic items are improperly labeled, stored or used; or</li>
<li>(5) persons with disease or infection which can be transmitted by food or drink are not restricted to prevent food contamination within the food service establishment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(c) Any of the following three conditions are violations constituting imminent health hazards which require the permit-issuing official or his designated representative to order the establishment closed and all service of food stopped immediately:
<ul class="none">
<li>(1) if the potable water supply within a food service establishment is not in full conformance with the requirements of Part 5 of this Title, and if it reasonably appears to the permit-issuing official or his designated representative that it can result in an imminent health hazard, and if the operator does not use single-service items and bottled water from an approved source for all potable water uses, the establishment is to be ordered closed and all food service to be stopped immediately;</li>
