Everything from age to specific skin issues can determine the right shampoo for your dog's needs.<strong> </strong>Plus, all the shampoos in this roundup, no matter its specialty, are highly rated. </p><p>Oatmeal baths are known to <a class="je" href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/colloidal-oatmeal-baths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help soothe various human skin woes</a>, like eczema and poison ivy. But oatmeal is a great natural remedy for canine skin issues, too. Since a dog's <a class="je" href="https://www.petmd.com/dog/grooming/evr_dg_shampoo_for_dogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skin pH level is different than ours</a>, most dogs need shampoos designed for them that are extra-gentle; oatmeal shampoo, specifically, can help relieve everything from allergies to hot spots. Some <a class="je" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-shampoos-for-cats-18179266">oatmeal shampoos work for cats</a> dealing with dry skin and other skin concerns, too. However, unless a dog shampoo explicitly states that it’s safe for cats, <a class="je" href="http://www.vetstreet.com/dr-marty-becker/can-i-use-dog-shampoo-on-my-cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you shouldn’t use it on feline friends</a>.</p><p>The picks below all contain oatmeal, mostly colloidal oatmeal. Colloidal<strong> </strong>oatmeal<strong> </strong>still has <a class="je" href="https://oatcosmetics.com/what-is-colloidal-oatmeal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bran, traditionally milled out of most oatmeals</a> and oat flours, which is the source of oatmeal's skin soothing benefits. The picks also contain other skin-nourishing ingredients — like aloe and vitamin E. In addition to containing quality ingredients, most are free from soap, parabens, sulfates, and artificial colorants and fragrances, all of which can potentially irritate your dog's skin. Many are pH-balanced and one is even hypoallergenic. I’ve even included two picks that are tear-free and puppy-safe, too. </p><p>Take a look at the <a class="je" href="https://dogstruggles.com/best-oatmeal-shampoos-dogs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best oatmeal shampoos for dogs</a> below. From warding off fleas to neutralizing odor, there should be a pick to suit your dog's needs. </p><div class="jk"><h3 class="jl">1.
