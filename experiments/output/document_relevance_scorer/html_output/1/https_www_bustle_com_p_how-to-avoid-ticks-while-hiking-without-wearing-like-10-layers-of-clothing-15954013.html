Unfortunately, the prospect of getting bitten by a tick turns that simple pleasure into a gamble with your health. Trying to <a class="iL" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-to-do-if-you-get-a-tick-bite-because-they-can-have-serious-consequences-9591217">avoid ticks while hiking</a> is like trying to avoid cars while driving, the chances are you'll at least come close to a tick. </p><p>The trick is figuring out how to enjoy nature, without interacting with it too much. In order to hike and avoid ticks, you have to take a lot of precautions and also know that no matter how much you protect yourself, there's always a chance <a class="iL" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/9-bug-sprays-for-ticks-that-actually-work-10931682">you'll still get bitten</a>. So understanding as much as you can about ticks, where they like to hang out, how they find their way onto your body, and how to properly remove them and care for yourself if you do get bitten is the key. </p><p>According to the <a class="iL" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/data-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Center for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), in 2017, there were 42,743 reported cases of Lyme Disease and nearly 18,000 addition kinds of tick-borne illnesses in the U.S. alone. The number is more than 10,000 more than 2016, which scientists believe is both due to an increase in ticks and an increase in awareness about tick-borne illnesses in general. Chances are, there will be even more reported cases over the next year, so take ticks seriously, and protect yourself from illness by following these simple, but important steps:</p><div class="iQ"><h3 class="iR">Dress Appropriately </h3><figure class="iT"><div class="iU" style="padding-top:100%"><div class="jN"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/6f11d110-cd60-4e75-8743-095c60b4ad4f-img_0965.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/6f11d110-cd60-4e75-8743-095c60b4ad4f-img_0965.jpg?w=349&amp;h=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/6f11d110-cd60-4e75-8743-095c60b4ad4f-img_0965.jpg?w=349&amp;h=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/6f11d110-cd60-4e75-8743-095c60b4ad4f-img_0965.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/6f11d110-cd60-4e75-8743-095c60b4ad4f-img_0965.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt /></noscript></div></div><cite class="iO">Author</cite></figure><div class="iK"><p>Wearing tall, thick <a class="iL" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-5-best-socks-for-hiking-9707090">socks while hiking</a> is imperative. No matter what season you're hiking in, thick, tall socks serve as a protective layer that keep your feet safe, your shoes comfortable and the bugs away from your skin. During tick season, it's best to hike with tall socks that go over your pant leg. Yes, seriously, tuck your pants into your socks no matter how dorky it looks. Even if it feels too hot to wear long pants, you should. If you absolutely must wear shorts, make sure your socks are pulled up as high as they go and check yourself periodically over the course of your hike. </p></div></div><div class="iQ"><h3 class="iR">Avoid Danger Days</h3><figure class="iT"><div class="iU" style="padding-top:100%"><div class="jN"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/ab062c51-7755-4b07-9d08-0f5cfc8adeb1-img_0649.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/ab062c51-7755-4b07-9d08-0f5cfc8adeb1-img_0649.jpg?w=349&amp;h=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/ab062c51-7755-4b07-9d08-0f5cfc8adeb1-img_0649.jpg?w=349&amp;h=349&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/ab062c51-7755-4b07-9d08-0f5cfc8adeb1-img_0649.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/2/14/ab062c51-7755-4b07-9d08-0f5cfc8adeb1-img_0649.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt /></noscript></div></div><cite class="iO">Author</cite></figure><div class="iK"><p>During the spring and early summer, ticks are out and about and at their <a class="iL" href="https://americanhiking.org/resources/ticks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most dangerous growth stage</a>.

If it's uncharacteristically warm for the season, that's an extra dangerous day as the ticks will come out and be hungrier than usual.
