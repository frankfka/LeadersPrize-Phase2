That said, while most brands state that they're suitable for <em>all</em> stains, oil and grease are more stubborn than most, meaning the majority of formulas will fall short. The picks below are backed up by serious research to find you the detergents that are truly best at fighting grease.</p><p>First, the <a class="jk" href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-3-best-laundry-detergents-for-odors-16819857">best laundry detergent</a> for you is largely going to depend on the type of washing machine you have. High-efficiency (or HE) washing machines <a class="jk" href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-he-laundry-detergent-do-you-need-it-2145975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use less water than standard machines</a>, and as a result, require detergents that clean with less suds. Nowadays, HE detergents (even those that fight grease) are available in liquid, pod, or powder form, but these options are just a matter of personal preference. </p><p>To find a detergent that's powerful enough to fight grease, it's important to understand the nature of grease. Grease stains are especially stubborn because of the <a class="jk" href="https://www.oxiclean.com/en/Stain-Solutions/how-to-remove-grease-stains" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lipid molecules</a>, which are insoluble in water and great at clinging to cloth fibers. In order to remove a grease stain, a solution has to effectively break that bond. <a class="jk" href="https://www.aocs.org/stay-informed/inform-magazine/featured-articles/keeping-up-with-detergent-chemistry-august-2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Given the competition between detergent manufacturers</a>, brands don't always disclose their exact formulas, but ingredients like baking soda, bio-enzymes, alcohols, and concentrated solvents will be most effective. </p><p>All six of these detergents contain one or more of those bond-breaking grease-fighters, and all work in any machine (including HE). </p><div class="jq"><h3 class="jr">1.

This concentrated, German-made formula with stain-fighting enzymes is designed to fight stains, prevent odors, brighten whites, and provide long-lasting freshness — but it's also shockingly effective when it comes to removing grease and oil stains. It works with all types of machines (including HE). On top of that, it has a scent that buyers call &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;pleasant,&quot; and it costs just $10 for a 32-load bottle. No wonder it's the top pick. </p><p><strong>Reviewers say</strong>: &quot;Doubt I'll ever use another detergent. LOVE the smell; that's a big change for me because I always got no-scent products because the odors were offensive, off-putting, or chemical.
