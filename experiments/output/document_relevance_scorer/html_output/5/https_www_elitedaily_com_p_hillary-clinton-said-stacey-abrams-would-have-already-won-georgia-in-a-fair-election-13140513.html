Since the polls closed on Nov. 6, tensions have risen between candidates Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp in a race that still hasn't been called. With Kemp in the lead as of Nov. 14, according to the <em>The New York Times</em>, allegations of voter suppression have arisen. Now a former presidential candidate has jumped in to have Abrams' back. <a class href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416583-hillary-clinton-stacey-abrams-wouldve-already-won-if-shed-had-a-fair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary Clinton said Stacey Abrams would've already won </a>in a fair election, and she might have a point. </p><p>&quot;If she had a fair election, she already would have won,&quot; <a class href="https://www.statesman.com/news/20181113/in-austin-hillary-clinton-honored-for-public-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinton said </a>while speaking at the University of Texas' LBJ School of Public Affairs on Tuesday, Nov. 13, according to <em>The Statesman</em>.

Per <em>The New York Times</em>, the vote count as of Nov. 14, has <a class href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/georgia-governor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kemp in the lead</a> with 50.3 percent of the vote, and Abrams at 48.8 percent. However, Kemp has been accused of allegedly using his role as Georgia's secretary of state, which oversees elections, <a class href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416583-hillary-clinton-stacey-abrams-wouldve-already-won-if-shed-had-a-fair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to suppress votes</a>, according to The Hill. <a class href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/11/08/brian-kemp-resigns-georgia-secretary-state/1929921002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kemp stepped down</a> from his position following Election Day. In October, nearly a month before the general election, the Associated Press reported that nearly <a class href="https://apnews.com/fb011f39af3b40518b572c8cce6e906c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">53,000 voter registrations in the state had been placed on hold</a>, 70 percent of which were from black voters, due to the so-called &quot;exact match&quot; law which required voter registration applications and state records to match exactly and would dismiss applications over typos and small details such as accents on names. In some areas, even if you were able to get a ballot, there was no guarantee it would be counted — In one county, hundreds of <a class href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/20/politics/gwinnett-county-absentee-ballots/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">absentee ballots were thrown away</a> due to &quot;discrepancies&quot; between the ballot and registration info, per CNN.</p><p>In a statement provided to Elite Daily in October, Candice Broce, a representative for the Secretary of State's office, says that the responsibility for judging eligibility for absentee ballots lay with local officials, and that the secretary's office had opened an investigation into the issue. She also referred to litigation around the exact-match law as a &quot;publicity stunt&quot; saying, </p><blockquote class="_">Their claims are bogus. It is a complete waste of our time and taxpayer dollars. ... There are no voter registration applications 'on hold in Kemp’s office, and every single pending voter can vote in the November 6th election. Any claims to the contrary are politically motivated and utterly false.</blockquote><div class="ai"><div class="jh"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1062468265954418693"></a></blockquote></div></div><p> On Monday, Nov. 12, Judge Amy Totenberg, a United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, ruled that the state of <a class href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/politics/georgia-election-provisional-ballot-ruling/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia must conduct a &quot;good faith review&quot;</a> of all the<a class href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/provisional-ballots.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> provisional ballots</a> — given to people who, for instance, are at the wrong polling place or missing ID, which are held aside to be reviewed and counted after the voter's eligibility is confirmed — that were previously rejected based on the fact that the voter's name was not found on the registration list, according to CNN. This means that instead of just cross-referencing using only the voter registration list, the state must use &quot;all available registration documentation.&quot; CNN also reports that as part of the review, the state must create a <a class href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/13/politics/georgia-election-provisional-ballot-ruling/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotline for voters</a> to call in to see if their provisional ballot was counted and if not, why. Totenberg ruled that the state's <a class href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416427-federal-judge-finds-georgia-county-violated-civil-rights-act-by-rejecting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">election officials cannot call a winner </a>before Friday, Nov. 16 at 5 p.m. ET, according to The Hill. </p><div class="ai"><div class="jh"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1060274207509151749"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>The question over possible voter suppression doesn't end there. The very next day, Tuesday, Nov. 13, U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May ruled that Georgia's Gwinnett County's <a class href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/416427-federal-judge-finds-georgia-county-violated-civil-rights-act-by-rejecting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejection of absentee ballots </a>based only on an omitted or incorrect birth year was a violation of the Civil Rights Act. Per the ruling, the county will have to <a class href="https://2vwlfu3ynqxb3npfhm3m8lde-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Show-Temp.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">review rejected ballots</a> and count them in the 2018 midterms. Elite Daily reached out to representatives of the county for comment on the ruling, but did not immediately hear back. </p><p>If there are enough uncounted votes for Abrams in all those rejected provisional and absentee ballots — per NBC, she would need a net gain of 21,000 votes — then there will be a <a class href="https://ballotpedia.org/Runoff_election" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">run-off </a>on Dec. 4, which means that there will be another election to determine whether Kemp or Abrams will take the post as governor of Georgia. </p><p>Abrams seems confident about a possible run-off. According to a Nov. 9 <a class href="https://twitter.com/gwlauren/status/1060959163730350080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet from her campaign manager</a>, Lauren Groh-Wargo, the Abrams campaign has already purchased television ads for the runoff in an attempt to &quot;prepare for all possibilities.&quot; </p><div class="ai"><div class="jh"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gwlauren/status/1060959163730350080"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>It seems Clinton and two judges both feel that the elections might not have been totally fair to Abrams, but there's still time for her to pull out a victory and make history. </p></div></div></article><div class="bI"></div></div></div><div class="r"><input id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox" class="u" /><nav class="s"><div class="v"><ul class="x"><li class="F"><form class="hk hm" action="/search" target="_top" autoComplete="off" autoCapitalize="off"><input type="search" placeholder="search..." aria-label="Search Elite Daily" name="q" class="hl" value /></form></li><li><a href="/news">News</a></li><li><a href="/experiences">Experiences</a></li><li><a href="/style">Style</a></li><li><a href="/entertainment">Entertainment</a></li><li><a href="/dating">Dating</a></li><li><a href="/video">Video</a></li></ul><ul class="w"><li class="C"><a class="E" href="/"></a></li><li><div class="B"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cw"><i class="cy"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/EliteDaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cw"><i class="cG"></i></a><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/elitedaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cw"><i class="cC"></i></a><a href="https://instagram.com/elitedaily/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cw"><i class="cA"></i></a><a href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Elite-Daily/8822570171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cw"><i class="cE"></i></a></div></li><li><div class="A"><a href="https://bustle.company/">About</a><a href="/contact">Contact</a><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a><a href="/terms">Terms</a><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></div></li></ul><label for="navCheckbox" class="G"></label></div></nav></div><noscript><img src="https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif" /><img src="https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&amp;c2=15353773&amp;cs_ucfr=0&amp;cv=2.0&amp;cj=1" /><img src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=100478526961130&amp;ev=PageView&amp;noscript=1" /></noscript></div> <script>__INITIAL_STATE__={"type":"ArticlePost","id":"13140513","title":"Hillary Clinton Said Stacey Abrams Would Have Already Won Georgia In \"A Fair Election\"","clipTitle":"Hillary Clinton Got Brutal About How \"Fair\" Georgia's Election Was To Stacey Abrams","path":"/p/hillary-clinton-said-stacey-abrams-would-have-already-won-georgia-in-a-fair-election-13140513","url":"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/hillary-clinton-said-stacey-abrams-would-have-already-won-georgia-in-a-fair-election-13140513","rating":"NSFA","nsfaLevel":"HIGH","publishedAt":1542222573554,"updatedAt":1542223009552,"bodies":[{"version":"0.3.1","atoms":[],"cards":[["embed-card",{"type":"tweet","key":"uploads/image/2018/11/14/c28e7da2-a1ca-4934-9e09-04dc4ffdce68-pw262iym_400x400.jpg","attribution_url":"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1062468265954418693","attribution":"staceyabrams on Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1062468265954418693","provider_name":"Twitter","width":400,"height":400,"html":"\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eOur quest for basic fairness continues: we want every eligible vote cast to be counted\" - @gwlauren\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; (@staceyabrams) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1062468265954418693\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e","ratio":1,"inputUrl":"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1062468265954418693","_v":1}],["embed-card",{"type":"tweet","key":"uploads/image/2018/11/14/320d4ac2-6f89-46c6-859e-77c276d1f9da-drbzxcexqaatkp5.jpg:large","attribution_url":"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1060274207509151749","attribution":"staceyabrams on Twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/staceyabrams/status/1060274207509151749","provider_name":"Twitter","width":1200,"height":627,"html":"\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eIn a race this close, one vote could be the difference between a loss, a runoff, or a victory.
