CNN reported that although McCain's colleagues on Capitol Hill had been prepared for the worst for months, McCain's decision to bring his treatment to a halt nonetheless left them in shock. Tributes to the senator were circulated even before he died, and <a class="ec" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/john-mccain-obituary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCain's own quotes highlight his fierce dedication </a>to his country. </p><p>McCain drew respect from both sides of the political aisle, with Republicans and Democrats alike offering him their support.

In his pursuit of what he believed to be right, McCain occasionally voted against the Republican Party on important measures. He was a critical voice in opposing the repeal of Obamacare, and opposed tax cuts for the rich during his 2000 presidential campaign. From being a prisoner of war in Vietnam to pursuing bipartisanship in an increasingly divided Congress, McCain's political legacy spanned decades, and the following quotes show just how much he cared about his country — and how much he was willing to overlook partisan politics in favor of advancing reforms.</p><div class="ei"><h3 class="ej">On How He Wanted To Be Remembered</h3><figure class="el"><div class="em" style="padding-top:66.6667%"><div class="jJ"><noscript><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/8/24/1ae2d029-b33c-4a03-9a83-b1f1b2fae279-getty-874295374.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70" srcSet="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/8/24/1ae2d029-b33c-4a03-9a83-b1f1b2fae279-getty-874295374.jpg?w=349&amp;h=232.6667&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 349w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/8/24/1ae2d029-b33c-4a03-9a83-b1f1b2fae279-getty-874295374.jpg?w=349&amp;h=232.6667&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 698w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/8/24/1ae2d029-b33c-4a03-9a83-b1f1b2fae279-getty-874295374.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70 646w, https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/8/24/1ae2d029-b33c-4a03-9a83-b1f1b2fae279-getty-874295374.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70&amp;dpr=2 1292w" sizes="(min-width:768px) 646px, 349px" alt /></noscript></div></div><cite class="eg">Alex Wong/Getty Images News/Getty Images</cite></figure><div class="eb"><p>Shortly after the news broke last year that McCain had brain cancer, CNN Jake Tapper asked the senator <a class="ec" href="https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1033017067811876864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how he wanted the American people to remember him</a>.
