On Saturday, <a class="ec" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/obituaries/john-mccain-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. John McCain died at the age of 81</a>, the <em>New York Times </em>reports. McCain had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017, and his family recently announced that he would no longer undergo treatment. The Arizona Republican served as a Navy pilot before entering politics, and spent five and a half years in a prison camp after his plane was shot down over Vietnam. He ran for president twice and was nicknamed &quot;maverick&quot; for his willingness to work with Democrats in Congress and vote against Republican policy priorities.</p><p>A day prior, McCain's family <a class="ec" href="https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/8/statement-from-the-mccain-family" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">released a statement</a> explaining that the senator had discontinued medical treatment. </p><blockquote class="ef">Last summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict. With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment. Our family is immensely grateful for the support and kindness of all his caregivers over the last year, and for the continuing outpouring of concern and affection from John’s many friends and associates, and the many thousands of people who are keeping him in their prayers. God bless and thank you all.</blockquote><p>McCain's death reduces Senate Republicans' already-slim majority by one seat, leaving them with 50 seats to Democrats' 49 seats. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey will appoint an interim senator to fill McCain's seat until the next general election, when the state will elect a replacement to fill out the rest of McCain's term. <a class="ec" href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2017/07/20/what-if-senator-mccain-leaves-office-how-process-works/494621001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona law requires interim senators</a> to be of the same party as the senator they're replacing, so Ducey will appoint a Republican to temporarily fill the seat. </p><p>McCain graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1958 and enlisted in the Navy, ultimately becoming a pilot. He survived several near-misses during his military career, including one in which his plane <a class="ec" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/06/nation/na-aviator6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flew into power lines and caused a blackout</a> in Spain. </p><p>In 1967, <a class="ec" href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/28/john-mccain-prisoner-of-war-a-first-person-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCain's plane was shot down</a> during a bombing run over North Vietnam. The crash nearly killed him, and he was subsequently held as a prisoner of war for five and a half years. The North Vietnamese military tortured him during his imprisonment, but offered to release him in 1968 after learning that his father was a powerful Navy admiral. <a class="ec" href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/567269/reminder-john-mccain-refused-early-release-from-prison-camp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McCain refused early release</a>, however, as he thought it would be unfair to his fellow POWs who had been held for longer than him.</p><div class="eo"><div class="mW"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/BeschlossDC/status/920308064884023297"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>McCain was released when the Vietnam War ended, and ran successfully for the House of Representatives in 1982. After serving two terms in the House, he mounted a successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1986, and won re-election every six years afterward.  </p><p>Throughout his Senate career, McCain built a reputation as an independently minded legislator willing to break with the Republican Party on high-profile issues. He <a class="ec" href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/04/john-mccain/mccain-used-to-oppose-tax-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initially voted against George W.
