<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> <strong>Updated: </strong> ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’<br/>
<span id="more-5890"></span><br/>
Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20171230112451/https://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/whos-ahead/key-states/map.html">swing states </a> in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20171230112451/https://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/georgia/index.html">situation</a> between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.” </p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what  actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">   He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">   On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">   He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">    “Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">   After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">   “I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">  He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.” </p>

<p>McCain should take ‘art’ classes of the not the conventional type but perfecting the ‘art of flip flopping’.The way he is not able to explain out his changing positions as explained by his  intense inter actions with the member of the audience in Aspen is a pointer.His prefrence for town hall type meetings will only expose more of his weakness than help cash on his fewer strengths.</p>

<p>Did anybody ask if he considers himself presumptuous for conducting shadow foreign policy in Georgia?</p>
<p>Can you imagine what Lieberman et al would be saying if Obama did that?</p>
<p>Did anybody ask how much his views have been affected by the lobbying money of the Georgians going to his key foreign policy man, Randy Scheunemann?</p>

<p>i used to wonder who on earth would support this clueless, 20th century republican man.  who would go to see him and cheer him on?</p>
<p>then i realized that almost 20% of the country thinks america is on the right path.</p>
<p>mccain’s base.</p>
<p>thank goodness it’s so very small. state polling shows sen. obama competing in many bush states.  mccain does not compete in any kerry states.</p>

<p>NY Times, could you maybe have a caucus piece about how McCain’s chief foreign policy adviser just excused himself because he’s been a lobbyist for Georgia for several years?</p>
<p>It’s really unpleasant to watch McCain do this fake “man of the people” bit.   It’s not like Democrats don’t do this too, and it’s unpleasant to watch when they do it, but it’s even more grating when done so blatantly by a candidate whom you don’t support (and who owns ten houses).</p>

<p><i>Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq…”</i></p>
<p>Veteran’s for Common Sense has an <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20171230112451/https://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/articleid/9559" rel="nofollow">article</a> on its website which reviews McCain’s voting record on the troops and veterans.  The article states, “John McCain <b>skipped close to a dozen votes on Iraq</b>, and on <b>at least another 10 occasions, he voted against arming and equipping the troops</b>, providing adequate rest for the troops between deployments and for health care or other benefits for veterans.”  The article cites specific votes.</p>
<p>The post also states that McCain said,<i>“I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.</i></p>
<p>McCain is a hypocrite.  If he argues that Obama used Iraq for political reasons, then isn’t it equally true that McCain is using the surge for political gain?  Wouldn’t it be also true that McCain has used visiting wounded troops for political gain?</p>

<p>Just plain sad that this man of advanced age is prepared to accuse his younger opponent as a traitor – such a shame. Pray, may I ask, what tactics did he employ to get the Republican nomination? Where have all the younger men and women gone in the G.O.P? Have ‘wise’ old men frightened them away from stepping out to serve this fine nation? There is a time for everything and Senator McCain’s time is over!</p>
<p>He can blow his own trumpet ad nauseum about his foreign policy (the man does not even know that Mr Putin is no more the President of Russia), and what America needs is an intelligent,  educated in the broader sense, intellectual, able, and most articulate leader with vigor and vision.</p>

<p>So, opposing the Iraq War, discussing the fact that you opposed the Iraq War during the primary, and thinking that the surge wasn’t worth it is somehow traitorous and “using the war for political reasons”–while supporting the Iraq War, running on the idea that only you can truly protect people from terrorism because you supported the war, and thinking that the surge was a great success is the sign of a true patriot?  So, basically, if you are a candidate who doesn’ support the war, you’re a scumbag who uses war for political reasons, but if you are a candidate who supports the war, then you’re just looking out for America’s best interests?  </p>
<p>McCain is essentially saying, “If you don’t agree with my positions on the war, then you are a disloyal American and you may or may not be a traitor.”   </p>
<p>How disturbingly reminiscent of Joe McCarthy and his ilk.</p>
<p>Also, let’s put aside for a moment the fact that a huge number of experts on Iraq say that the surge, if it had any truly positive effect at all, was just one of several factors that contributed to Iraq’s presently somewhat more stable condition.  </p>
<p>If not admitting that the surge was a success is a sign of willingness to put politics before America, then shouldn’t McCain’s refusal to admit that the Iraq War was an idiotic decision and a useless, tragic distraction from the actual issues at hand be, by his own logic, a sign of McCain’s willingness to put politics or hawkishness before the welfare of the American people?   </p>
<p>Considering that it was McCain’s decisions, not Obama’s, that led to the deaths of thousands of American soldiers and even more Iraqi civilians, if this is the kind of logic we’re using, then Obama clearly occupies the moral high ground.  </p>
<p>The thing is, I think Obama is classy enough to assume that McCain’s support of the war stems from principle–a principle with which Obama passionately disagrees, of course.  The fact that McCain has decided that anyone who disagrees with him is unprincipled and disloyal speaks volumes to his character (if he is only saying this for political purposes), his intelligence (if he actually believes the sewage he’s spouting), or both.  </p>
<p>How anyone could possibly vote for a man who not only thinks that the Iraq War was a fantastic idea and is going splendidly and that we need to stay indefinitely until we “win,” but that we should have stayed in Vietnam until we “won” (McCain has said that “We lost in Vietnam because we lost the will to fight”–not because 50,000 soldiers died in a useless war, or anything like that).  </p>
<p>Where’s the logic, the judgment in that?  Obama is no dove, but he recognizes a useless, pointless, destructive conflict when he sees one.  That’s what I want in a president–not someone who thinks that war is always necessary to solve all of our problems.  </p>
<p>The country got it wrong twice by choosing the more aggressive candidate under the delusion that aggressiveness equaled security.   I think enough people now understand that security is gained through clear-mindedness and the intelligent application of both diplomacy and force.  Therefore, I hope and I think: Obama ’08.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. soldiers have donated more presidential campaign money to Democrat Barack Obama than to Republican John McCain, a reversal of previous campaigns in which military donations tended to favor GOP White House hopefuls, a nonpartisan group reported Thursday.</p>
<p>Troops serving abroad have given nearly six times as much money to Obama’s presidential campaign as they have to McCain’s, the Center for Responsive Politics said.</p>
<p>The results also are striking because they favored Obama, who never has served in the military. McCain meanwhile, is a decorated war veteran who spent nearly five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. The Arizona senator graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and had a 22-year career as a naval aviator.</p>
<p>Obama has opposed the war in Iraq and says he would withdraw combat troops within 16 months. McCain has been a steadfast supporter of the war, saying he would withdraw the troops only when conditions on the ground warrant it.</p>
<p>“Obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nation’s sacred trust with its veterans, to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve, as well as the support they and their families need,” Obama spokesman Nick Shapiro said.</p>

<p>As always, John’s straight foward answers and understanding of the many issues facing our country is refreshing. He is and always has been a stand up guy, who says what he believes, not what he thinks you want to hear or what he believes he must say to get elected. Whether you agree with him on all the issues or not, you know where he stands.</p>
<p>Obama, on the other hand, changes his stance on issues almosy daily. How can you believe a person who contradicts himself on such important matters? The candidate of “change” ? He sure is!<br/>
I challenge any of you to name another candidate from either major party who had less experience or a shorter resume than Mr. Obama during this whole nomination process.<br/>
I don’t expect any answers.</p>

<p>John McCain read from Wikipedia on his teleprompter, assuming that a brash and loud response would make him look commanding. No thank you, I would much rather vote for a Statesman who can understand the nuances of the political world, not one who is likely to go off the deep end and push the button without thinking first. McCain, despite his years of ‘experience’ and his ‘extensive’, calls Putin the president of Russia, talks about Iraq’s border with Pakistan, confuses Shia and Sunni, and  is not sure who the insurgents are in Iraq.  McCain’s blustering bellicose approach is positively frightening in the world today.   He even scares fellow Republican senators, and that scares me.</p>

<p>McCain’s actions last night were the result at being at an altitude of about 8000 feet. The thin air got to him; hence the half-truths and lies he was saying last night. By the way, he did say a couple days ago that “nothing was off the table with Social Security”; this includes breaking his “no new taxes pledge”. By the way, the Congressional district that includes Aspen is a Democratic. Finally, where else would job McCain be but in the Colorado capital of the rich who can afford the $5$5/gallon gas;.iI is the lower and middle class workers that keep the rich happy which cannot afford the high priced gas and they certainly were not at the Aspen Institute last night.</p>

<p>John McCain Has A Serious Problem. Does He Stick By Bush Or Does He Distance Himself From The Admidistration. It Looks Like He Is Moving Away From Bush To Appeal To Independents. But He Needs Bush’s Big Donors And Needs To Solidify The Base Which He Has Not Yet Done.</p>

<p>Wow! After committing to Obama – and never having voted for a Republican in my life – I’m now on the fence. This McCain is really just a REUGLAR JOE! Wow, I like Abba too! In fact, I have their greatest hits on my iPod. And I’ve gotta tell you, I take alot of flack for it. Just like Mac!!</p>
<p>I really have to think this over now. I mean, I always thought McCain was bought and paid for by guys like the Keating Five  and big oil. But he’s obviously a man of the people. And how about that Cindy. Gets her hand crushed by a supporter but keeps on keepin on! And always a smile. You’d t hink she just reaped a windfall on the AB sale to Belgium, or Brazil or whatever, Man, what a gal! </p>
<p>And hey, how about the Mac Man’s performance in Sturgis? Man, he had 50,000 BIKERS eating out of his hand. Plus his trip to Marshall – as in We Are Marshall . If all he cared about was the big boys, why would he spend so much time with the little folk? </p>
<p>Finally, I hear he’s considering Tom Ridge – that outspoken abortion advocate – for VP. So he’s obviously a lot more liberal than he’d like us to believe. </p>
<p>Let’s see now. Mac or Barack? Mac or Barack? Barack or Mac? Negotiate or attack? White or black? Homey or Wack? See you in November!</p>

<p>“As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer.”</p>
<p>Has McCain sunk this far already?  </p>
<p>I don’t think that McCain is a traitor because his views don’t match mine.  </p>
<p>But I do think that, if his recent behavior is any indication, he has adopted Joe McCarthy as a role model.</p>

<p>After reading a very favorable article on John McCain, and then reading the negative responses in the comments about him makes me like John McCain even more.</p>
<p>Obama is still an anomaly to the rest of the country…..how did he get to the political heights he is in now?…….Why isn’t the MSM reporting on all his radical associations?….Why are they promoting him when he’s “accomplishments” and voting records as a state senate are so full of holes and questions?……. </p>
<p>It’s a real scary thought that we as Americans can so foolishly fall for this “Character” that David Axelrod has created as a Presidential Candidate……..very scary.</p>

<p>“After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.”</p>
<p>Another news report said the question was about the surplus in the Iraqi budget….</p>
<p>I wonder what that voter thinks about getting fluff  back instead of an answer to their serious question.</p>

<p>Oh Joan, </p>
<p>It must be nice to be a part of that 20%. </p>
<p>McCain’s refreshing straightforward answers that you love so much are only ignorant statements made without thinking. They’re off the cuff responses that often times don’t mesh with previous off the cuff statements he’s made. They may seem “straightforward” because they’re quick responses however, a quick answer doesn’t a right answer make.<br/>

<p>The presumptuous John McCain who inserted himself into the Georgian crisis and inflamming the “Cold War” has the nerve to talk about Obama….go back to the Senate. Well he’s been MIA there as well.</p>
