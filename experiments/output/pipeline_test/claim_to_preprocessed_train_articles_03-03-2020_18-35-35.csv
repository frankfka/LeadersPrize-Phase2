One of the best ways to lay out our welcome mat is to reopen border tourism centers that were closed by Governor Doyle and make them self-sustaining by working with the private sector  just as I have done on various projects in Milwaukee County. Working with the private sector will also be vital to attract tourists to major events that we already host in Wisconsin, and also existing national conventions, meeting, and tournaments that we can bring to our state. As governor, I will prioritize the Governors Conference on Tourism because, unlike Governor Doyle, I recognize the importance of this conference, and the industry it represents, to Wisconsin. Walker also noted his plans to improve the Department of Natural Resources will play an integral role in helping to bring back sportsmen from across America who have planned their trips elsewhere in recent years, as Wisconsin natural resources have been mismanaged, and deer population has dwindled. Walker also announced the launch of Homecoming Wisconsin, which will work with university alumni associations and state agencies to reach out to individuals, families and businesses that have left our state and personally invite them to our wonderful festivals and celebrations throughout the year in every community across the state. Walker concluded, For years, Wisconsins brand was Escape to Wisconsin. By renewing our focus on tourism and implementing new, creative solutions, we can, like never before, invite Americans to Escape to Wisconsin again.; Relevance: 0.25284573435783386; Entailment: 1; STS Similarity: 3 ||=== Article: Relevance: 0.5630319551880609, Entailment: 1 ===|| Web Page Redirect - Wisconsin DNR.

For instance, the proposed savings in Medicaid could undercut health reform, both by making it more difficult to ensure that reimbursement rates will be adequate to attract enough providers to serve the greatly increased number of low-income people who will be served through Medicaid and by cutting the federal share of state Medicaid administrative costs just as states will face large increases in those costs to handle the larger Medicaid beneficiary population.; Relevance: 0.7766345143318176; Entailment: 1; STS Similarity: 3 |||| The plan also does not say a word about the most consequential deficit issue that Congress faces immediately  the fate of the Bush tax cuts for high-income households, which if made permanent, would widen deficits and debt by as much as the entire Social Security shortfall that the plan proposes to close in a painful manner.
