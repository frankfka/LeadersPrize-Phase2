"0","Says federal law enforcement officers cut off questioning of the Christmas Day underwear bomber by giving him a Miranda warning after 30 minutes of questioning.","1","=== NEW Article: 0.8689518808808078 ===|| Investigators are allowed to question a suspect without providing a Miranda warning if they are trying to end a threat to public safety. In a future trial in a federal court, prosecutors would likely justify Abdulmutallab's questioning without a Miranda warning by arguing that the FBI agents needed to know quickly if there were other planes with other bombs headed for the United States. The nine/eleven attacks and other past plots have shown al-Qaida's penchant for synchronized attacks in multiple locations. Since the incident, Republican lawmakers have argued that the Obama administration mishandled the case by not considering putting Abdulmutallab in military custody - part of a larger political argument about whether terror suspects should face military or civilian justice.; Relevance: 0.7485358715057373; Entailment: None |||| Such a move is not unusual in cases where investigators or prosecutors want to protect themselves from challenges to evidence or statements. By bringing in a so-called ""clean team"" of investigators to talk to the suspect, federal officials aimed to ensure that Abdulmutallab's statements would still be admissible if the failure to give him his Miranda warning led a judge to rule out the use of his first admissions. Even if Abdulmutallab's statements are ruled out as evidence, they still provided valuable intelligence for U.S. counterterrorism officials to pursue, officials said. In the end, though, the ""clean team"" of interrogators did not prod more revelations from the suspect.; Relevance: 0.7285388112068176; Entailment: None |||| The interview lasted about fifty minutes. Before they began questioning Abdulmutallab, the FBI agents decided not to give him his Miranda warnings providing his right to remain silent. While the Miranda warning - based on a one thousand nine hundred and sixty six Supreme Court ruling - is a bedrock principle of the U.S. justice system and a staple of television cop shows, there is a major exception which could apply in Abdulmutallab's case.; Relevance: 0.7281286716461182; Entailment: None |||| The officials provided an account of the law enforcement response to the holiday bombing on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of the investigation. Here is what officials say happened: Shortly after noon on Christmas, federal agents were notified that Northwest Airlines flight two hundred and fifty three had arrived at the Detroit airport from Amsterdam, with a passenger who had lit an explosive device on the aircraft. After being restrained and stripped bare by fellow passengers and crew, Abdulmutallab was handed over to Customs and Border Protection officers and local police. The officers decided the suspect needed immediate medical attention, and an ambulance crew took him to the burn unit at the University of Michigan Medical Center.; Relevance: 0.718185544013977; Entailment: None |||| But when they read him his legal rights nearly ten hours after the incident, he went silent. Since the attempted bombing, several prominent lawmakers have argued he should have been placed immediately in military custody, and the nation's top intelligence official said he should have been questioned by a special group of terror investigators, rather than the FBI agents who responded to the scene. The officials who spoke to The AP said on-scene investigators never discussed turning the suspect over to military authorities. And their accounts show that as the hours passed, the FBI turned to its own expert counterterror interrogators and made no effort to involve the special unit, which was not yet up and running.; Relevance: 0.7153863906860352; Entailment: None ||=== NEW Article: 0.6698200702388122 ===|| Police have opened an investigation into the incident.

As dean of Harvard Law School, Elena Kagan sent an e-mail to students each fall criticizing the militarys ban against gays and lesbians serving openly as wrong  both unwise and unjust. Kagan was a strong supporter of his interest in military service, Scherer said by telephone from Kabul yesterday, and he cheered her nomination. At West Point, Kagan gave a memorable and sincere talk in which she thanked the cadets for volunteering to defend her freedom, said Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan, dean of the academic board. She also discussed Article VI of the Constitution, which requires American officers to swear a loyalty oath, not to a leader, but to the Constitution.; Relevance: 0.805584192276001; Entailment: None |||| Clark, dean at the time, said the greater good of the university would have to prevail over the law schools stance against discrimination. When Kagan took over, Clark said in an interview yesterday, she did the same thing I did for several years  send an e-mail to students every year explaining the military exception to our nondiscrimination policy. Kagan cited her deep distress over the issue in a two thousand and three message to students, calling the ban on openly gay service members a profound wrong  a moral injustice of the first order. As other law schools around the nation, led by a Boston College professor, mounted a lawsuit charging the Department of Defense with violating the First Amendment by forcing law schools to allow military recruiters on campus, Kagan did not join in. In two thousand and four, Kagan and fifty three other Harvard Law professors signed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting the lawsuit, but some students and faculty were disappointed that she had chosen not to lead the legal battle. Later that year, a federal appeals court ruled that the Solomon Amendment, a one thousand nine hundred and ninety six law that denies federal money from schools that do not permit military recruiting, infringed improperly on the law schools constitutional freedoms.; Relevance: 0.7880992889404297; Entailment: None |||| But Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, issued a statement Monday opposing Kagans nomination, just hours after President Obama announced her as his pick. Inhofe cited Kagans lack of judicial experience, which is becoming the Republicans main attack point against Kagan, and also strongly criticized her poor judgment at Harvard, charging that she banned the US military from recruiting on campus. Kagans involvement in the Harvard military controversy dates to two thousand and three, when she became dean. She had inherited a new Harvard policy that allowed military recruiters to use official law school channels to access students. Harvard had been forced in two thousand and two to lift its longstanding ban when the Department of Defense threatened to strip about  dollar three hundred and twenty eight million in federal funding from the entire university  about fifteen percent of its annual budget  if the law school did not relent.; Relevance: 0.7854486703872681; Entailment: None |||| Conservative critics have derided her as antimilitary and have predicted she would be an activist judge bent on imposing her personal views on the Constitution.

In an effort to counter party disloyalty charges, Poizner has gone so far as to mischaracterize his job in the George W. Bush White Houseas well as attempt to deflect evidence that he had hoped and expected to work for a Gore administration, NewMajority has learned. In an interview last month with conservative radio host Eric Hogue, Poizner cited his service in the Bush White House, claiming that he was passionate about President Bush and that the Bush White House would have wanted nothing to do with me if I was not on board philosophically.

When questioned by NewMajority, the Whitman campaign defended those as contributions to opponents of internet taxation that would have adversely affected Whitmans business (at the time she was CEO of eBay), in the case of Boxer, or support for colleagues and personal friends (Westly).

Under the federal Voting Rights Act, Texas and some other states with a history of past discrimination are required to get federal government approval, called pre-clearance, before changes to election law can go into effect.

Historians have warned that such a ""laundry list"" approach is a lazy and ineffective way to teach and sets up our schools  and our children  to fail as they struggle through a blizzard of names and facts.
