Although gun ownership rates were associated with higher rates of domestic gun homicide involving both male and female victims the researchers saw a definite gender difference in intimate partner gun homicide victims . Two other issues bear on this relationship as well . First as we have noted in previous reports demographic issues play a significant role in crime rates since young males produce disproportionately high rates of crime . As criminologists Darrell Steffensmeier and Miles Harer have noted most of the change in crime rates in the period one hundred and ninety eight thousand and eighty eight can be explained by changes in the proportion of the population in the age group one thousand five hundred and twenty four . As we have seen high incarceration rates can be a function of high crime rates criminal justice policies or social policies in other areas that influence crime . Some persons contend that the United States has a high rate of incarceration due its high rate of crime or violent crime rate compared other nations .
