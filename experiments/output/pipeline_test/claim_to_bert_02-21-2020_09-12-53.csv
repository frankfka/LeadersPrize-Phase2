"0","""Productivity has risen 18 percent ...yet wages have stayed flat... There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000.""","2"," . But we know that the standard for any economic system is not just that it creates growth but that it lifts up families across America who work hard and dream big every day . As we have seen the home foreclosure crisis these past few years build the ripples from Wall Street we know can have a significant impact on families far away in Pahrump Nevada where I recently was and other places that might never give much of a thought to what goes on here but whose daily lives will be impacted . As we have seen with the home foreclosure crisis too many American families are not sharing in the growth that is created and driven from this city . Now productivity has risen eighteen percent among American workers over the past six years yet wages have stayed flat and family incomes have fallen by nearly dollar one thousand . There are five million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in two thousand . On top of stagnant wages we have seen a rise in economic anxiety . Students struggling with the skyrocketing cost of college families burdened by health care costs premiums have doubled in the last six years and we see the increasing role that energy prices play in peoples lives . Job growth since two thousand and one under President Bush has been the weakest of any economic recovery since the great depression . it is an economy that demands more from our workers and gives less in return . Over the past six years worker productivity that means how hard you are working how much you put out per hour of your work . Productivity has risen eighteen percent American workers are the hardest working people in the world . And yet just look around wages have stayed flat . Corporate profits are at a forty year high but the average family s income in America has fallen by nearly dollar one thousand . Income that is sorely missed as college costs have risen forty percent health care premiums have doubled and gas prices have more than doubled . Wall Street needs to be part of a comprehensive solution that brings to the table all those responsible and calls on them to do their part . Wall Street helped create the foreclosure crisis and Wall Street needs to help us solve it . let us start with an honest clear eyed assessment of what went so terribly wrong . Over the past seven years as incomes fell and wages stagnated many families were lured into risky mortgages with rates that later jumped beyond what they could afford . Now we can debate what was technically illegal we can debate what should be defined as predatory . But there is no debate that what happened did not reflect the best of our financial system . It did not reflect prudence transparency or even an understanding that behind large bundles of securitized mortgages are real families who were led into bad situations by people who should have and even did know better . They started talking about maybe they could actually go home use what they learned growing up on a farm and make biodiesel fuel and that is what they did"
"1","""I saw my father march with Martin Luther King.""","1"," . Martin Luther King SeniorAn Unheralded Christian Civil Rights Leader and Father . WIKIMEDIA COMMONS Martin Luther King Sr. in Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta January fourteen one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine . Everyone in this country knows something about and respects Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. Well almost everyone respects him . King Jr. is one of only four men along with Lincoln Washington and Columbus who have a national holiday in their honor . What many people do not know is the life of his father and the influence that Senior had on Junior . Without the life and Christian emphasis of Martin Senior it is unlikely that Jr s life of leading towards racial equality would have occurred and this country could have looked very different today . Martin Luther King Jr. s Daughter God Can Triumph Over Trump Charisma News . But her brother Martin Luther King III seems to be on the opposite page . A visitor holds a commemorative booklet as she listens during the Martin Luther King Jr. 46th Annual Commemorative Service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in two thousand and fourteen . Martin Luther King s daughter said on Monday that God can triumph over Trump but the slain civil rights leader s son struck a conciliatory tone after meeting with the president elect on the U.S. holiday that honors their father . The comments by the children of King who championed racial justice until he was assassinated in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight at the age of thirty nine punctuated an imbroglio involving Donald Trump and African American congressman John Lewis that broke out over the weekend . The dispute started when Lewis seventy six a contemporary of King s who endured beatings and jail time in the civil rights movement of the 1960s said in a televised interview that he saw Trump s election as illegitimate because of Russian interference in the campaign . That drew a scornful response from Trump . Many that are present are not a positive influence to their kids . This column shows what a strong positive influence can have on a son on a generation and even on a country . Martin Senior was born just as Martin King and eventually became a Baptist minister in Georgia . In a trip as an adult to Germany he became so enthralled with the life and story of reformer Martin Luther that he legally had his name changed to Martin Luther King . And he also changed the legal name of his young son to Martin Luther King Jr. What an influence Luther must have had on Martin Senior . Clearly the courage and convictions of Luther helped King Senior and Jr. to take a strong and dangerous stand for the Biblical dogma of equality . Senior was an early leader in the South towards racial equality and his son Martin Junioralso a Baptist ministerfollowed in his footsteps . But I think anyone who sees the very real parallels between Selma and Ferguson yes there have been incredible strides by way of improvement but there are still huge issues that we are facing and those parallels are indicative of that fact he added"

The IG report was highlighted Thursday by the Weekly Standard . The two thousand and five policy would also have been in effect during the tenure of former Secretary Condoleezza Rice . An aide to Rice said she rarely used email but always used department email for official communications . Current Secretary John Kerry is the first head of the agency to primarily rely on a State.gov email account the State official said . State Department officials and Clinton aides have offered no response to questions in recent days about how her private email system was set up what security measures it used and whether anyone at the agency approved the arrangement . it is unclear how such a system run off an Internet domain apparently purchased by the Clinton family could have won approval if the departments policies were as the inspector generals report describes them .

"4","""When Pakistan erupted in crisis, I spoke to Musharraf before Bush did.""","2"," . And it is clear that he has not moved toward democracy but has solidified his rule and become quite anti democratic with his removal of the chief justice and many of the other moves that he is taken . At the same time we depend upon him to try to control the tribal areas out of which come the resurgent Taliban and Al Qaida fighters who cross the border into Afghanistan . Again this is an area where I think the United States needs to be just focused like the proverbial laser . When I was in Pakistan and Afghanistan in January I met with both President Karzai and President Musharraf . CLINTON And I asked them if it would help to have a high level presidential envoy working with both of them to try to figure out how we can move toward what are American interests and how we can keep Pakistan from undermining the war against the Taliban and Al Qaida . CLINTON And unfortunately when I got back and I called the White House and I made this suggestion it fell on deaf ears . So there is a lot we need to do . As you know in the past few weeks Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf has declared a state of emergency there . he is dismissed several Supreme Court justices . he is recently placed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto under house arrest twice now and imprisoned numerous other dissenters . And I know you spoke with Musharraf last week . And you along with several others on the stage assert that the U.S. should maintain its current level of financial support for Pakistan . And my question is is it your view that there are times when the security of the United States is more important than the way a key ally like Musharraf disregards freedom and disregards democracy . BIDEN First of all I do not think we should maintain the same aid we are giving . The argument against attacking bin Laden directly is that Pakistan of all the unstable places in the world is the most dangerous because it has an arsenal estimated to include more than a hundred nuclear weapons . The state is shaky and its civilian leader Asif Ali Zardari the widower of Benazir Bhutto is new and untested Islamist terrorist groups their allies in the Pakistani intelligence service and the military are all serious alternative power centers . President Bush initially did not attack the tribal areas because he was afraid that if he did the government of Pervez Musharraf would fall . When Bush began to tire of Musharraf and to tilt away from him and then started a program of air strikes and incursions into Pakistan it coincided with a period of rising instability there . In the name of encouraging genuine political competition in Pakistan the Bush Administration prodded Musharraf to allow Benazir Bhutto to return and begin a political campaign . She was assassinated by Islamist terrorists . Islamists began to stage significant terrorist attacks in response to the American strikes in the tribal areas .

Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov . Asked for comment a Huckabee spokeswoman said Having had to face the most Democrat legislature in the country and a state controlled almost entirely by the Clinton Political Machine Governor Huckabee is proud of his record of cutting taxes almost one hundred times and leaving Arkansas with an almost dollar one billion surplus . Still if a tax cut is not accompanied by a fall in government spending then taxes may have to go up in the future to pay for that . Christie s spokesman said the growth of the budget under the Garden State governor is mostly driven by state entitlements which the governor has little control over and that he has cut the discretionary parts of the budget . When you scratch below the surface the governor s fiscal discipline over the budget is more dramatic with discretionary spending cut to dollar two point three billion below where it was in two thousand and eight a nine percent cut .

There were only two women working as campaign managers on two thousand and sixteen presidential campaigns including in the many primary campaigns Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway who served on Mike Huckabee and Donald Trump s campaigns respectively . The disparity seems to carry through the top campaign staffs for most of the presidential candidates that year . For example only sixteen percent of Trump s top campaign staff listed were women and only thirty five percent of Hillary Clinton s were per Ballotpedia .

"7","""We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent.""","1"," . On every decision I could make as governor I came down on the side of life . And that is why the Massachusetts Right to Life Association awarded me their leadership award after my term as governor . It is true that Romney vetoed several bills that violated the anti abortion position including one that would have provided funding for embryonic stem cell research and another that would have made the morning after pill available without a prescription . As we have pointed out before the Legislature overrode those vetoes but Romney did indeed adopt a number of anti abortion positions as governor . He neglects to mention however that in October two thousand and five he signed a bill seeking greater access to family planning services for low income individuals access that would have included availability of that same morning after pill . it is also a significant stretch to say that the Massachusetts Right to Life Association gave him an award . For starters the award was given by the Pioneer Valley Regional Chapter of Massachusetts Citizens for Life . And I just was struck by President Obama goes to Planned Parenthood the first sitting president to address Planned Parenthood and does not mention the word abortion . Why does not he hail them for their clinics and their affiliates performing more than three hundred thousand abortions a year if it is such a wonderful thing . they are ashamed to say frankly what they do . Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion . I mean before I had a job that paid me health insurance Planned Parenthood is where I got my health care everything from just general health care . And I was not going there to get abortions I was going there to get health care . So Planned Parenthood is not simply an abortion . So that is not the only thing they do . And the second thing is look Gosnell is not something that should outrage liberals . This is something that should outrage anyone . You know general abortion services are not performed . He is performing this in late late term . And I do not think that any rational or thinking human being of feeling human being thinks that that is okay whether it is in the womb or out . This was also a case of impoverished women who were going to a place for supposed health care that should not have even been open that was not being inspected where the laws in that state were not being followed . What are we afraid of . The law enforcement did a superb job in Boston . These people are before courts . Mayor Giuliani and I are both prosecutors . We would love to prosecute this case . But signals were missed here . And but that has nothing to do with Guantanamo . But if we are in a situation where we are in a different level of war where there is no other option I think that it is a very dangerous position to make pledges that are outside the most important pledge you make and that is the oath you take to uphold the Constitution and protect the people of the United States"

More than a century later Ronald Reagan signed a law forgiving the undocumented status of three point two million people who came to the U.S. illegally most of whom ultimately obtained U.S. citizenship . When it comes to individual acts of mercy however here are the totals for Donald Trumps other predecessors Ford two years in office three hundred and eighty two pardons twenty two commutations Carter four years five hundred and thirty four pardons twenty nine commutations Ronald Reagan eight years three hundred and ninety three pardons thirteen commutations George H.W . Bush four years seventy four pardons three commutations Bill Clinton eight years three hundred and ninety six pardons sixty one commutations George W. Bush eight years one hundred and eighty nine pardons eleven commutations Barack Obama eight years two hundred and twelve pardons one thousand seven hundred and fifteen commutations . Although Obamas record for commutations puts Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in the shade it is less generous than it appears . Almost all of them came in the last two years of his presidency as part of an initiative designed to cull federal drug prisoners sentenced under mandatory minimum laws that had since been repealed . The administration essentially invited all federal drug offenders to apply for clemency and though the raw totals in two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and seventeen were high the percentage was low only five percent . Mike Huckabee probably has a great future as a on FOX News or as a motivational speaker but his career in politics is done . Stick a fork in him . In America today given the problem for this is I mean incident itself is bad enough but there is a pattern . As governor he granted clemency and pardons to over one thousand prisoners which is three times the number of pardons and clemencies granted by three former governors . And so this is a problem . This would be a problem in a general election for Huckabee . But this will be a primary issue in the Republican primary where law and order issues are really salient . But only fifteen states both regularly review pardon applications and grant more than thirty percent of them according to research done by Margaret Love who served as U.S. pardon attorney under Presidents George H.W . States vary in how much clemency discretion the governor has . Regardless his or her inclinations can play a big role in how often it is granted . Jerry Brown for instance has pardoned eight hundred and fifty four people and commuted two sentences since two thousand and eleven while Republican predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger granted fifteen pardons and ten commutations in just over seven years according to the states governors office . Scott Walker a Republican refuses to grant pardons altogether saying it undermines jurors and courts decisions . Pardons generally restore civil rights and can clear records that keep people from certain jobs or licenses pardons often come after people have completed their punishments"

Gallagher and Golsteyns cases have become politically charged in recent months with some Republican Congress members calling for prosecutors to drop charges or a presidential pardon . In March forty lawmakers signed a letter urging the Navy to free Gallagher pending trial . Soon after Trump announced on Twitter that Gallagher would be moved to less restrictive confinement . Trump has already used his powers in a military case pardoning a former US soldier convicted in two thousand and nine of killing an Iraqi prisoner . Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna was convicted of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone after killing a suspected al Qaeda terrorist in Iraq . A military court had sentenced Behenna to twenty five years in prison .

"13","In the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama ""voted 'present,' instead of yes or no"" on seven votes involving abortion rights.","2"," . The Chicago Tribune said the present votes were the equivalent of taking a pass . Well instead of looking for political cover or taking a pass we need a president who will take a stand . And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country . Chicago Tribune Sen. Obamas explanation for present votes is questionable few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy as Sen. Obama did . Sen. Obama said he worked out an arrangement with abortion rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote present on some bills if they feared a no would look insensitive and endanger their re election . But few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy . And like Obama they were not politically vulnerable . Sen. Obama voted present on a bill to prohibit the presence of adult sex shops near schools places of worship and day care facilities bill allows local governments to regulate the presence of adult sex shops . SB609 Passed thirty three fifteen five three twenty nine two thousand and one . Illinois Now on Obama s Present Votes On Choice . During Sen. Obamas two thousand and four Senate campaign the Illinois NOW PAC did not recommend the endorsement of Obama for U.S. Senate because he refused to stand up for a womans right to choose and repeatedly voted present on important legislation . As a State Senator Barack Obama voted present on seven abortion bills including a ban on partial birth abortion two parental notification laws and three born alive bills . In each case the right vote was clear but Sen. Obama chose political cover over standing and fighting for his convictions . When we needed someone to take a stand Sen. Obama took a pass said Grabenhofer . Not yes not no but present which is kind of like voting maybe Well in the Illinois State Senate on issue after issue my opponent voted present instead of yes or no . Seven of those votes were on a womens right to choose .

"15","The Mormon religion has ""a plan that will see the Constitution thrown out and replaced by a theocracy.""","0"," . there is a difference between spreading the Gospel and forcing it down peoples throats . it is an easy line to cross we might care so much about our faith and believe in it so much that we are desperate to do anything to make others agree with us . But we can not force them into faith by changing their behavior . On his campaign website Trump promised If I am elected president and Congress passes the First Amendment Defense Act I will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of Catholics and the beliefs of Americans of all faiths . I am horrified by what that implies . I am horrified because people I truly love and care about are now in fear that jobs marriage healthcare will be denied them based on their sexual identity . There is no room in Christianity to discriminate . When you try to regulate something like marriage which is a social and secular contract as much as a spiritual ceremony today you are forcing people to live by your beliefs whether they agree or not . When you do not offer a job or provide a service to someone because you disagree with them you are imposing your beliefs . it is hypocrisy at its finest . So much right wing fear mongering hinges on the myth that Muslims in the U.S. will somehow impose religious beliefs on non Muslims ... so should not Christians also be against creating our own theocracy . America is a secular nation . it is a nation founded on freedom and freedom of religion is important to that . These proposed religious freedom orders do little to defend freedom of religion rather it uses that idea as a shield for discrimination fear mongering and rejecting the notion of equality by placing Christians above others . Indeed Trump has promised to sign FADA into law if it passes in Congress . We do not know any details about if or when any kind of religious freedom order will be signed but I do know one thing religious freedom acts do not protect the rights of all Americans to practice their religions in peace as the name might imply . And as a Christian I think that is profoundly offensive . The fact that Trump s temporary travel restriction specifically singled out travelers from majority Muslim countries already felt to many like a sure sign that this administration is not devoted to true religious freedom for Americans so does the fact that the Trump White House at one point supposedly worked on an immigration plan that prioritizes Christians suffering from religious persecution according to NPR . that is not protecting religious freedom it is protecting Christian freedom . You would think that as a committed Evangelical Christian I would be over the moon about the prospect of a religious freedom order . An order meant to protect me and to force others to live according to my beliefs . I believe in Heaven and understand what I hear so many of you saying on Facebook or Twitter that our lives on Earth are temporary and our final hope is in Christ"

Income tax deduction of dollar seven thousand five hundred per taxpayer to defray health insurance costs . Cost breakdowns not spelled out . Arizona Sen. John McCain Opposed some of Bush s tax cuts because they were not wedded to spending cuts now says the tax cuts should be made permanent . Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney Tax breaks to those earning less than dollar two hundred thousand including eliminating capital gains interest and dividend taxes for most . Estimated cost of dollar thirty two billion a year to be paid in part by keeping growth of non defense spending under inflation rate . Also make permanent the Bush tax cuts that expire in two thousand and ten and eliminate estate tax . But he spent just one minute skimming over how he would pay for it and neither he nor his campaign provided a breakdown of the revenue his plan would raise . Obama s campaign said he would pay for his proposals by closing corporate tax loopholes cracking down on international tax havens and raising the top rate on capital gains and dividends . But the campaign did not say how much each of those proposals would generate . When Obama announced his health care plan in May his campaign said he could pay for it by rolling back several Bush tax cuts that benefit the wealthy . That included restoring the top rate on investments to pre Bush levels twenty percent for capital gains and thirty nine point six percent for dividends . Now Obama s advisers say they have more than enough revenue from other sources to pay for his health care plan and the capital gains and dividends increase can be used in part to fund the tax plan . However they could not say how much that would raise or exactly how high Obama would raise them except that the top rate for both would be between twenty percent and twenty eight percent the rate President Reagan set in one thousand nine hundred and eighty six . that is because the question of if the tax bill will pass is now more a question of something else will Senator Marco Rubio R FL vote for it . For now that answer is a no . That much is clear after the former Republican primary candidate announced his stance on the bill on Thursday . Rubio says he will not vote for the final GOP tax bill unless it includes an expansion of the child tax credit more on what exactly that means below . More specifically Sen. Rubio wants to increase the amount of the tax credit that is refundable . I can not in good conscience support it the tax bill unless we are able to increase the refundable portion of it . there is a way to do it and we will be very reasonable .

At the time Biden criticized the Trump administration for relaxing Obama era guidances about investigating sexual assault on college campuses . Biden has also explicitly challenged Trump s own behavior on numerous occasions including this week at the University of Miami . Back in the fall Biden told NBC s Meet the Press that Trump s recorded comments about grabbing women back in two thousand and five are the textbook definition of sexual assault and show an instinctive abuse of power .

RUSSERT But you raised taxes and the Cato Institute a conservative think tank gave you a D and an F for your tenureship as governor . So there have been some legitimate criticisms of you as a Republican for raising taxes and for spending money . If you are a small business person and you pay more money than you paid last year to the government you can call it a fee call it a tax it is a three letter word that means the same . He made claims about things like tax increases but he failed to mention that some of those were either court ordered or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for things as roads . And I left my roads in great shape took them from the worst in the country to what Truckers magazine said were the most improved . He left his roads in a mess in Massachusetts with huge problems in the infrastructure . He claimed that he did not raise taxes but in fact he did raise taxes by half a billion dollars . But I do not think it would be appropriate for me to try to weigh in on whether or not they ought to have the elections in their own country . MR. RUSSERT Let me turn to foreign policy specifically Pakistan . Do you believe that the government of Pakistan should postpone the elections in light of the assassination of Benazir Bhutto . Now when we raised taxes it was one of two things either to meet an educational demand our schools were deemed by the courts to be unconstitutional . In Arkansas we have been down the road of a governor defying the courts and saying I am not going to follow the court order . did not turn out real well . I was not going to be the second Arkansas governor to do that . The city of Mayfield Heights will not increase its income tax to from one to one point five percent . The new income tax rate would put Mayfield Heights in line with suburbs like Lakewood Westlake and Avon Lake . Those income tax rates are among the lowest in Cuyahoga County . Officials have said they will also raise the tax credit for people who work outside of the city up from fifty percent to one hundred percent . This does not require a public vote . Residents voted down the issue sixty eight to thirty two percent . North Olmsteds attempts to raise money to pay for parks and recreation expansions failed again . And I want to make sure that if we are going to spend more money and the court said we have to then the next thing is let us make sure we spend it well and we spend it wisely . HUCKABEE Well in some cases you know I cut ninety four taxes . People forget what we did do on a positive nature eliminated the marriage penalty indexed the income tax for inflation so low income people were not paying high tax rates . So what we tried to do in tax policy by doubling the child care tax credit and by raising the threshold at which people paid we untaxed a lot of the poor people and gave them a shot at actually making it up the economic ladder"
