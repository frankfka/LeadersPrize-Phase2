On taxes, President Barack Obama wants to raise "the top rate to 44.8 percent."
1
Also any host country tax costs for employees working outside the U.S. should be considered when the tax and gross up costs are considered taxable income to the assignee in the host country . . In contrast to the additional zero point nine percent HI tax it is unlikely that the tax on unearned income will be covered under a totalization agreement . . Thus an individual on U.S. assignment with a valid Certificate of Coverage is not exempt from the additional unearned income tax . . Some have already started the process of updating assignment cost accruals and reviewing tax equalization policies and foreign pension plans . . The future promises more change as the president signed new legislation passed by Congress in mid December that concerns tax rates and other taxes that were scheduled to sunset and benefits for individual taxpayers . . What direction tax policy will take starting with the new Congress that convenes in January two thousand and eleven is unknown . . The House passed budget calls for scaling back or eliminating loopholes and carve outs in the tax code that are distorting economic incentives . . We do this not to raise taxes but to create space for lower tax rates and a level playing field for innovation and investment . . Americas corporate tax rate is the highest in the developed world . . I believe it would leave us with a nation that is less prosperous and less free . . To begin with chasing ever higher spending with ever higher tax rates will decrease the number of makers in society and increase the number of takers . . Able bodied Americans will be discouraged from working and lulled into lives of complacency and dependency . . Second we have to restore common sense to the regulatory environment so that regulations are fair transparent and do not inflict undue uncertainty on Americas employers . . Third we have to keep taxes low and end the year by year approach to tax rates so that job creators have incentives to invest in America and . . Fourth we have to refocus the Federal Reserve on price stability instead of using monetary stimulus to bail out Washingtons failures because businesses and families need sound money . . That includes raising the top rate to forty four point eight percent . . That would amount to a dollar one point five trillion tax increase on families and job creators . . The President says that only the richest people in America would be affected by his plan Class warfare may be clever politics but it is terrible economics . . Tax law changes were enacted to offset some of the health care reform costs . . While the legislation has implications for many companies two changes in particular that were discussed during the KPMG TaxWatch program can impact international assignees and their employers a zero point nine percent increase in the Medicare tax on wage income and a new three point eight percent health insurance tax on passive investment income . . Additional zero point nine Percent Hospital Insurance Tax on High Income Taxpayers Beginning in two thousand and thirteen the employee five portion of the Medicare hospital insurance HI tax currently equal to one point four five percent of wages is increased by an additional zero point nine percent on wages received in excess of a threshold amount dollar two hundred and fifty thousand for married couples filing a joint return MFJ or a surviving spouse the dollar two hundred and fifty thousand is applied to the combined wages of both spouses dollar one hundred and twenty five thousand for married individuals filing separately MFS and dollar two hundred thousand for single filers . . This increase to the Medicare tax is assessed only to the employee there is no corresponding employer contribution . . As a result international assignment program costs will increase by the additional zero point nine percent tax plus the gross up costs if an assignee is subject to the zero point nine percent HI tax due to the inclusion of assignment related allowances in income . . Also host country tax costs for employees working outside the United States assuming U.S. Social Security tax continues to apply may increase if the HI tax and gross up costs paid by the employer are considered taxable income in the host location . . See Figure two . . This is approximately the same percentage as with the zero point nine percent wage tax despite the larger potential program cost impact . . Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of two thousand and ten In addition to granting tax incentives for employers that hire and retain unemployed workers the HIRE Act made a number of changes to the tax law to improve tax compliance with respect to foreign accounts and cross border transactions . . The House passed budget does that by making the tax code simpler flatter fairer more globally competitive and less burdensome for working families and small businesses . . By contrast the President says he wants to eliminate deductions but he also wants to raise rates . . The tax is three point eight percent of the lesser of i net investment income or ii the taxpayers modified adjusted gross MAGI income that exceeds a threshold amount of dollar two hundred and fifty thousand for MFJ or a surviving spouse dollar one hundred and twenty five thousand for MFS and dollar two hundred thousand for single filers . . Unlike the additional zero point nine percent HI tax the tax on unearned income is not withheld by the employer and should be considered when determining whether an individual must make estimated tax payments . . For U.S. citizens and residents when applying the formula to determine the tax any foreign earned income excluded less deductions disallowed under Internal Revenue Code section nine hundred and eleven must be added back to arrive at MAGI . . In a recent speech he gave in response to our budget President Obama outlined a deficit reduction approach that in my view defines shared scarcity . .

Says "in the Legislature, (Mary Nolan) has been a party-line Democrat, showing a 100% track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union."

Mary s other half Jack Bog s Blog .we have started our due diligence on Portland City Council candidate Mary Nolan with whom we have had little contact . . In the legislature she has been a party line Democrat showing a one hundred percent track record in harmony with the American Civil Liberties Union . . But what troubles us is her connections and those of her husband Mark Gardiner . . You can change the location at any time . ACLU of Oregon two thousand and one Legislative Scorecards zero point two zero zero one Legislature Not Bad Considering ... As we look back on the two thousand and one Legislative Session we will remember it as a session that could have been very contentious for civil liberties that managed to tone down most of the divisive rhetoric and seek consensus . . While there were certainly exceptions ACLU succeeded in accomplishing almost all of our major goals . . As a result of the most recent Court of Appeals decision ruling it unconstitutional Rep. Lane Shetterly R Dalles introduced a bill to bring it back to life . . Although we lost our effort to replace the bill with a new law that would prohibit an adult from preparing a child to engage in unlawful sexual activity legislators supporting the bill promised to revisit the issue between now and two thousand and three . . Senate vote twenty two seven House vote forty six twelve . . After intense pressure on one pro choice Republican the bill came out of committee and was headed for defeat on the House floor . . Wanting to avoid a nasty floor debate and as a compromise to moderate Republicans who did not want a floor vote on anti choice legislation House leadership linked this bill to the contraceptive equity bill SB six hundred and eight described below and both were pulled from the floor and set back to committee to die . . WIN . . Nolan s been a City Hall insider in past careers and she has the Old Money that controls Portland fully in her corner . . Moreover she is hired the consummate local political fixer Mark Wiener who will do what it takes to rub out Nurse Amanda . . Equal ProtectionGay Lesbian Rights Bullying Intimidation Harassment of Students HB three thousand four hundred and three . . In contrast to last sessionas divisive actions by House leadership in support of a Defense of Marriage constitutional amendment this session was very quiet on issues effecting gay and lesbian rights . . The good news is that the few bills that were hostile died a quiet death in committee . . Governor Kitzhaber included dollar three hundred thousand in his budget to encourage collection and analysis of traffic stop data by police agencies . . That funding was added to SB four hundred and fifteen along with the creation of a new statewide committee to discourage racial profiling by law enforcement and foster improved relationships between police and communities of color . . WIN . . Introduced by Senator Charles Starr R Hillsboro SB seven hundred and forty six would have allowed the display of the Ten Commandments in public schools . . It unexpectedly came out of committee when Sen. Avel Gordly D Portland agreed to provide a courtesy vote in favor even though she opposed the bill so that it could be debated on the Senate floor . . We argued that the bill was unconstitutional under both the federal and state constitutions and would have required schools to prefer one religion over another by forcing them to select which version of the ten commandments they should post . . And Gardiner served as a business advisor to Peter Kohler and OHSU in connection with the catastrophic SoWhat District its aerial tram and its false promises of thousands of high tech jobs . . It is not taking us long to conclude that this couple has been feasting at the public trough for too long and that having Nolan on the City Council would be an invitation for further looting by the West Hills set . . It does not seem likely that she will get our vote . The House amendments would have required insurance companies that provide prescription coverage to include contraceptive coverage . . As noted above House Republican leaders convinced moderate Republican members to support sending the bill back to committee so that they could avoid voting on HB three thousand eight hundred and thirty above . . We are currently reviewing whether to soon file a court challenge based on anti discrimination law . . Discrimination in Charter Schools HB three thousand three hundred and ninety five . . We drafted amendments to the state charter school law to prohibit discrimination based on race and religion which had been omitted unintentionally when the law was first approved four years ago . . The changes were adopted without controversy . . We worked hard to craft a consensus bill that eventually was supported by prosecutors and law enforcement agencies as well as criminal defense attorneys and other civil liberties advocates . . The new Oregon law includes more crimes than similar proposals in other states andat our requestalso includes review by an interim group to report to future legislatures and recommend whether the legislation should be renewed and expanded because of advancement in technology or other reasons . . We also pushed to include a requirement that law enforcement agencies keep all biological evidence while the new law is in effect . . Introduced at the request of Associated Oregon Industries HB two thousand and four would have allowed eleven th and twelve th graders to have basic school support funding for their tuition at any public or private Oregon college or university . . We opposed the bill because it would have diverted K twelve tax dollars to private religious institutions in clear violation of the Oregon Constitution . . The bill failed on the Senate floor by one vote . . Criminal Justice Civil Forfeiture HB two thousand four hundred and twenty nine and Criminal Forfeiture HB three thousand six hundred and forty two . .

The president dragged by Hill Republicans into the endless fiscal and personal nightmare that was the debt ceiling debate is hoping to make a clean break from the dreary capital recharge his batteries and mingle with middle American voters disgusted with all the players in the fight including him . . There is some talk among Republicans about reconvening the House of Representatives to advance additional deficit cutting legislation to reassure the markets . . This confirms my belief that the debt ceiling increase signed into law this week does not go far enough to change the nation s fiscal trajectory said Rep. Jack Kingston R Ga. in a statement . .

And it denounced the way the debt limit and threat of default became political bargaining chips Democrats see the report as a chance for the president to tear into the tea party and revisit some of his tactics during the debate itself telling voters he was the grown up in the room who wanted to go big but Republicans just were not interested . . Still long policy addresses are not the real purpose of a bus trip like this one . . White House staffers also say taking a bus will give Obama a chance to visit smaller communities than he could on a more conventional presidential sojourn . . The president looks very much forward to getting out in the country he is obviously spent a lot of time here in Washington and in the White House of late and to hearing from Americans in the Midwest about what is going on in their local economies what they think Washington can and should do to enhance economic growth enhance job creation in their parts of the country said White House press secretary Jay Carney . . And that is what this trip will be about . Charles Gasparino a stock market analyst for Fox News said how the markets react to the downgrade is a huge political story that will continue to play out in the two thousand and twelve elections . . Some strategists think Democrats can improve their political standing by blaming Republican obstructionism in Washington for stalling economic growth . . S P cited staunch political opposition to raising taxes as a reason for pessimism that Congress would get the nations deficit problem under control . .

Says that even if you have no children, "under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it."
1
Say for example you do not have any children . . Under Obamacare you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it . . Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one size fits all approach . . The intent behind the law seems clear . . Obamacare is government telling you what you must have it is not a solution that provides you with the health care options that you want and need . . Mary Taylor is Ohios 65th Lieutenant Governor . . Simply put these changes all have one theme in common government knows best . . In other words you the consumer do not know how to buy insurance for yourself you need the government to tell you what you must purchase . . There is no consumer driven market based approach when Obamacare is fully implemented . . Kasich says there will be a state exchange . . Now it is up to Taylor the insurance director who can not stand the new health care law to make it happen . . Koff is Plain Dealer Washington bureau chief . We do not want Obamacare said Rob Nichols the governor s spokesman who says the governor would prefer to see the Affordable Care Act repealed and replaced with a better law . . But by golly if it is inevitable do not let the feds be the ones to come in and do it . . We have not made a decision . . Third Obamacare squeezes the rating rules for insurance carriers in Ohio forcing some to pay higher premiums . . This means you will no longer pay premiums for health insurance based on your choices and lifestyle as much as you do today . . For example insurance companies can currently rate an individual on a wide array of factors such as health status occupation and tobacco use . . We have to get in position for this because we do not want the federal government coming in here and dictating an exchange Kasich said . . It is important for people to be able to have a way to shop and find out what is available but we also do not want a bunch of people in Washington who can not seem to get out of their way come in here and try to run Ohio . . So yes Ohio there almost certainly will be an Ohio specific exchange . . In fact many of the laws far reaching mandates and requirements are still being defined by Washington bureaucrats . . But as you look closer at some of its lesser known provisions one thing becomes clear the authors of Obamacare are more concerned with a government takeover of health care and less worried about you the consumer and the increasing cost of health insurance because of this laws mandates . . Here are just three of the major market changes among many that all Ohioans should understand . . Louisiana s health secretary told the New Orleans Times Picayune that state regulators and Gov . . Bobby Jindal do not want to be blamed for what they predict will be rising health care premiums . . Likewise Taylor likes what Ohio has already which she calls a robust market with insurers offering choices and competition without Washington s heavy hand . . And since Taylor also heads the Ohio Department of Insurance she has the responsibility to set up a new state insurance marketplace where Ohioans can shop mostly online for health coverage and apply for financial help to pay . . But given Taylor s vitriol will she actually set up this marketplace or health insurance exchange as the Affordable Care Act puts it . . Or will she follow the lead of Louisiana where state officials refuse to establish their own exchange . . Because there are so many factors there is more competition among insurance companies resulting in more options and lower costs for consumers . . But when Obamacare is fully implemented there will be only four rating factors permitted under law . . Those are age family status geographic location and tobacco use . . By narrowing the playing field consumers will have less control over their health care costs based on the decisions they make compared to todays laws . . And because choices are no longer rewarded insurance companies will be forced to treat everyone the same resulting in skyrocketing premiums for many low risk health conscious consumers . . The confusion over Ohio s exchange started after Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in late June and said As your Lt . . Governor and insurance director I will do everything I can to protect Ohio s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law . . Then she gave a speech with a similar theme . . But the Kasich Taylor team signed a letter in February saying it intended to apply for more . . How then could Taylor say that she has not made a decision . . This question was all the more pressing because Kasich has already embraced part of the Affordable Care Act the use of accountable care organizations or coordinated networks of hospitals primary care doctors and medical specialists . . First the laws heavy handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want . . Obamacare limits high deductible plans leaving consumers with fewer choices . . These restrictions however have not yet been clearly defined by Washington bureaucrats who could make them even worse . . Kasich s comments however did the opposite . . Now after a bit of back and forth with both of their offices it is fairly clear that Kasich will have the final word and that Ohio is likely to set up its own Taylor designed health insurance marketplace open for business by january one two thousand and fourteen . . we have gone from bombshell he said to head scratcher . . If you believe the governor scratch no more . . John Kasich s administration has been sending mixed signals on how and whether it will implement a key part of the new federal health care law potentially affecting thousands of Ohioans looking for insurance in a few years . .

Ex President Clinton to Newsmax Raising Taxes will not Work .Former President Bill Clinton tells Newsmax that Washington should not raise taxes until the slumping economy is turned around and says President Obama s plan to increase taxes on the wealthy won t solve the debt problem . . Clinton sat down for an exclusive interview with ... . . Editor s Note Read These Newsmax Exclusives . . Former President Bill Clinton tells Newsmax that Washington should not raise taxes until the slumping economy is turned around and says President Obamas plan to increase taxes on the wealthy will not solve the debt problem.Clinton sat down for an exclusive interview with Newsmax Founder and CEO Christopher Ruddy in New York where Clinton is holding the 10th annual gathering of the widely praised Clinton Global Initiative CGI an event that brings together heads of state business leaders humanitarians and celebrities to devise and implement innovative and successful solutions to some of the worlds most pressing challenges.In the wide ranging interview Clinton discussed his foundation climate change the economy taxes government regulations fellow Democrat Obama and the possibility of civil unrest in America.He also spoke about his wife Hillarys chances of running for president in two thousand and sixteen calling her the ablest person in my generation and offered his surprising take on the two thousand and twelve GOP presidential race.Asked about the impact the CGI experience has had on him since leaving the White House Clinton says First of all it is been exceedingly good to know that you can still make a difference that everything I always believed turned out to be true that private citizens can also do public good.it is enabled me to work with Bob Dole for example who was my opponent in one thousand nine hundred and ninety six . . We raised enough money to give college aid to the spouses and children of everybody killed on nine eleven or disabled I worked with the first president Bush on the tsunami in South Asia and Katrina with the second president Bush on the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.All this has been really rewarding to think that you can just focus on what works and how to do it faster cheaper better . . we are going to have dollar six billion worth of commitments here over a five to ten year period and they will affect another one hundred million people above the people we are already helping . . that is pretty good.President Obama this week unveiled his plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans in an effort to reduce the deficit even though he could be sure that Republicans would reject the plan.Clinton says Obamas whole approach to the deficit is a little confusing.He explains In the speech that the president gave to Congress he did not propose any new taxes . . The speech was dollar two hundred and fifty billion in tax cuts dollar two hundred and fifty billion in spending over a period of two to three years . . All I know is I am glad that she is serving now . Clinton disputes American Crossroads endorses Obama jobs bill CNN Political Ticker CNN.com Blogs . . CNN President Obama has an endorser in a former president and former foe . . But the influential former POTUS took issue with that portrayal . . The Republican group American Crossroads has used a quote from me in a video opposing President Obama s jobs plan and the Buffett Rule he said in the statement provided to Politico . . The advertisement implies that I opposed the Buffett Rule . . The president s dollar four hundred and forty seven billion jobs bill died on a five thousand and forty nine tally . . Obama had asked for payroll tax cuts for workers and businesses . . Economists believed it would add two percentage points of growth to the economy add one point nine million payroll jobs and reduce unemployment by a percentage point . . Harley Strickland Orange City . . Now Obama said he plans to work with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to see that individual proposals in the bill gain support as soon as possible . . The president also vowed to break the jobs plan into separate bills . . According to the bar owner the bill for the round of drinks came to dollar forty four point two five and Obama tipped very well . . Senate votes down Obama s jobs bill . . While Obama toasted to new jobs the Senate was shooting down his American Jobs Act back in Washington . . It focused mostly on a rather innovative set of payroll tax cuts and incentives to hire people.I personally do not believe we ought to be raising taxes or cutting spending until we get this economy off the ground . . If we cut government spending which I normally would be very inclined to do when the deficits this big with interest rates already near zero you can not get the benefits out of it.So what I would like to see them do is come up with a bipartisan approach starting with the payroll tax cuts because they have the biggest return.Then what I would like to see is an effort made at a bipartisan resolution of the banking home mortgage crisis.One of the things that President Reagan did with the Democratic Congress in the early 1980s that never gets any discussion is the way they set up this system to purge the debt overhang from the savings and loan collapse . . Americans lost the fact that whatever you feel about this millionaire surcharge it will not solve the problem.Talk coming out of Washington is that there is widespread disarray in Obama White House . . If Clinton could meet privately with Obama he was asked what advice might he give the president to jumpstart the economy and work with the Republicans.The first thing I would say is we need to get a joint plan Clinton responds . . I would organize a meeting . . Former President Bill Clinton released a statement Friday disputing the use of his own words as a critique for the president s American Jobs Act . .

Under a Wisconsin bill, "minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrestable offenses."
1
Passage of AB two hundred and thirty seven would constitute a vast extension of a policeman s discretion to arrest citizens . . Many hitherto minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws seat belt laws parking infractions etc would now be arrestable offenses . . Asst . . Wisconsin Bill Would Greatly Expand Arrestable Offenses The John Birch Society .Currently in the State of Wisconsin as with most states there are two types of violations of the laws one criminal offenses which can involve arrest being taken into custody and a fine and or jail time and two noncriminal offenses which normally involve getting a citation usually with the choice of paying a civil forfeiture a fine or going to court . . Some examples of noncriminal offenses that are punishable only by civil forfeiture are things like speeding tickets parking infractions or unpaid tickets noise ordinance violations campaign sign violations pet leash laws seat belt usage child restraints etc . . But a Wisconsin Assistant Police Chief from Brookfield wants Wisconsin legislators to pass AB two hundred and thirty seven which would convert all noncriminal offenses that are punishable by civil forfeiture into arrestable offenses . . Police Chief Dean Collins who testified at the legislatures hearing on AB two hundred and thirty seven accompanied by Rep. Joel Kleefisch who introduced the bill backed by many police organizations claims a uniform criminal statute needs to be established that would ease decisions for law enforcement officers by making every offense both criminal and civil forfeiture an arrestable offense . . The well spoken Chief believes sending an unsolicited fax should be a arrestable offense along with disturbing human graves fireworks violations and refusing to obey orders during an emergency . . The text of AB two hundred and thirty seven is short and to the point authorizing arrests for activities punishable by civil forfeiture . . In addition to the arrest powers under S. nine hundred and sixty eight point zero seven a law enforcement officer may arrest a person for a law violation that is punishable by a civil forfeiture if the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is violating or has violated the law . . Improper use of lasers and flashlights trespassing theft of satellite cable programming tattooing of children under eighteen and mistreatment of animals not exactly defined he says also should be arrestable offenses . . Chief Collins might have betrayed the real reason for his wish to criminalize all civil infractions when he admitted that his department was sued in federal court for violating a womans civil rights after she was arrested for illegal transport of a firearm open carry . . This procedure has worked very well throughout the history of our state . . Arrestable offenses should be kept to a minimum and other enforcement means those that already exist e.g civil forfeiture used whenever possible . . Criminalization arrest and jail should be reserved for the highest social wrongs . . Scott Walker and Lt. Gov . . Becky Kleefisch in opposition to making all civil forfeiture offenses into arrestable offenses in Wisconsin . About The John Birch Society .Why I am a Member of JBS . . This is also categorically false . . Police will continue to be able to issue citations for fines in these situations . . If those fines go unpaid courts can and will continue to issue bench warrants for the arrest of the persons who do not pay their civil forfeiture . . I n the video testimony in support of AB two hundred and thirty seven from Asst . . Chief Collins he makes the statement that if the legislature does not pass this bill there will be nothing the police can do to enforce civil forfeitures . . The group will continue to use legal recourse to deter unlawful treatment of law abiding Wisconsin residents who currently exercise their right to open carry and soon will exercise their right to concealed carry in Wisconsin the announcement read . . Other members and Wisconsin Carry have pending federal cases over police response to members wearing guns at a Madison Culver s in September and challenging the state ban on firearms within one thousand feet of school zones . . Brookfield s offer of judgment was not an admission of liability on behalf of these defendants and should not be construed as such according to the offer . . His department lost the case because Collins said there was no specific statutory authority to enforce state forfeitures So it appears he is trying to protect his department from costly misapplication and misunderstanding of police authority . . Wisconsin Carry the organization that won the lawsuit against Chief Collins police department has stated recently . . it is an affront to the citizens of the Badger State to see their state legislature even considering such a proposal . . Any attempt at converting every civil forfeiture offense into an arrestable offense is a serious legislative overreach . .

Gunta the city s lawyer said if the lawsuit is really about the principle involved the plaintiffs should consider donating the money back to Brookfield for gun education . .The woman who was arrested at gunpoint after she wore her gun to a church in Brookfield and a gun rights group have settled a lawsuit against the city and the officers who arrested her for dollar seven thousand five hundred . .

Pasco County schools have graduation rates "substantially higher than the state average" and dropout rates "below the state average."

The district achieved increased graduation rate s of eighty eight point five percent Florida calculation and eighty five point five percent National Governors Association calculation which are substantially higher than the state average . . It also secured a dropout rate of one percent which has plummeted below the state average . . The ruling . . Test scores largely support Fiorentino s claim of increased student achievement . . Since two thousand and five six the first full school year under Fiorentino s watch the district has improved its percentages of students achieving at grade level or better in reading math and science on the FCAT . . But it has seen declines in the percentage of students writing at grade level and the portion of students in the lowest twenty five percent making gains in reading and math . . State reports show that Fiorentino correctly states the district s graduation rates for two thousand and ten two thousand and eleven and that they are higher than the state averages which were eighty one point two percent and eighty point one percent respectively . . Pasco s rates were also up significantly from two thousand and six seven on both the state seventy three point seven percent and Governors Association sixty seven point eight percent measures . . These rates reflect the percentages of students who graduate within four years . . Pasco also was among a handful of districts that did not have significant gaps in the rates among its various demographic groups . . Statements by Pasco superintendent Fiorentino touting her record are mostly on the mark .LAND O LAKES a In seeking reelection to a third term Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino is touting the district s record as proof of her successful leadership.In a press re .LAND O LAKES In seeking reelection to a third term Pasco County schools superintendent Heather Fiorentino is touting the district s record as proof of her successful leadership . . In a press release announcing her bid she cited statistics ranging from graduation rates to the number of new schools built as evidence that the District School Board of Pasco County continues to shine with Fiorentino at the helm . . Fiorentino s facts and figures are generally correct but they do not always tell the full story . . But they are up overall from two thousand and six seven when the district earned five hundred and seven points and a B. . . Before two thousand and six seven the state graded districts on fewer criteria so scores before that year do not correlate . . The statement . . The district increased student achievement with the district increasing its overall points under the state recognition system earning an outstanding B rating earning just five points below an A . . Heather Fiorentino superintendent . . The district also had its first F rated schools Gulf Highlands Elementary and Anclote High in the past two years . . Fiorentino has tempered her language since issuing the press release saying simply that the district has earned either an A or a B from the state in every year she has been superintendent . . State reports show the district dropout rate was one percent for two thousand and ten eleven down from three point five percent in two thousand and six seven . . The overall state rate was three point three percent in two thousand and six seven and one point nine percent in two thousand and ten eleven so Pasco did show more improvement than the state did . . Fiorentino is on solid ground with these two numeric claims about the district s academic performance . . And for a time the new schools did help reduce class sizes districtwide . . But when it came time to implement the class size amendment for two thousand and eleven twelve even with enrollment changed only slightly the district did not meet the two thousand and two voter requirement for smaller classes . . The state imposed a dollar four million penalty against Pasco for its failure to comply the fourth highest fine among the thirty five districts that did not meet the rule . . The statement . . The district opened twenty two new schools over six years to keep pace with growth in student population and implement the class size amendment . . The ruling . . The ruling . . The district did get a B earning five points below an A in the two thousand and ten eleven state recognition system . . The total points earned five hundred and twenty was up from a year earlier when the district scored five hundred and seventeen points . . The statement . . The district focused on career preparation opening at least one certified career academy in each of Pasco s high schools . . The ruling . . School Board members have complained that the initiative has not worked as they had hoped . . In the spring of two thousand and eleven they said the district had not done enough to encourage enrollment . . Students outside each school s zone also had to provide their own transportation to campus which limited participation . . Fiorentino accurately touts the district s improved dropout rate . . We will continue to strengthen our business partnerships she said in a two thousand and eight candidate questionnaire . . By the start of the two thousand and nine ten school year the district had met that goal with a handful of schools actually offering two academy programs . . The state requires districts to have only one career academy . . Fiorentino said Friday that the press release contained a typo and agreed that the correct number is twenty . . This building boom did take place to help the district deal with rapidly increasing enrollment . . The district s student body grew from fifty nine thousand four hundred and seventy four at the end of the two thousand and four five school year to sixty six thousand six hundred and ninety six by the end of two thousand and ten eleven . . Fiorentino and the School Board have since submitted a plan to the state Department of Education for meeting the amendment s requirement which could reduce the punishment . .

"We’ve had a dramatic drop in violent crime since this law (‘stand your ground’) has been in effect."
1
Personally I know my intent with the legislation was simply to empower law abiding citizens to be able to stop violent things from happening . . And since five to two thousand and twelve we have seen a significant reduction in violent crime in Florida . . And what I have learned from it is that if you empower people to stop bad things from happening they will and they do and they have . . In fact that has not been the case he says . . we have seen a pretty dramatic decline in crime rates . . Why is crime down in spite of the recession . . REIHAN SALAM National Review Well I think it is absolutely fascinating . . When you think about how there has been an outpouring of grief not just in this town of Sanford Florida but throughout the country and the fact that there was a real near spontaneous eruption you had a huge number of people who were so passionate about this incident that they came out including Ta Nehisi I believe in New York City last night . . And this partly reflects the fact that you have new organizing energy in this country on a wide range of issues . . Probably but they will not necessarily be tied to any recession related factors Bushway says . . The crime rate has been leveling off lately following a long slow decline he says . . what is striking is it is looking like it might start going up . . Some theories suggest that the more government support an individual can receive through unemployment benefits food stamps controlled rent and other forms of welfare the less he or she may be encouraged to commit financial or stress motivated crime . . The governments stepped up aid during this recession may have had an effect on crime says Bushway . . The extension of unemployment benefits probably held off crime he says . . The use of these things and the addiction is part of this dangerous environment . . And then through all the media we have seen an elevated level of violence . . It used to be a wrestling or a pushing or a fistfight . . TA NEHISI COATES Well no I think I would agree with Reihan that thus far it has not been politicized . . I think a significant part of this is like Donna a lot of us in the African American community have had friends relatives who have experienced some sort of negative encounter some of them lethal with the police . . I have a friend from Howard University where I went to school who is like that . . Now I think we can all empathize with the notion of wanting to defend ourselves from crime . . My great concern is that there is been a number of cases besides Trayvon Martin where prosecutors cops are very concerned about this law and the broad way in which it is being implemented . . If you have a number of cases like that it seems to me it calls into question how the law was written . . PROTESTERS No justice no peace . . JEFFREY BROWN That decision has fueled the protests but Sanford police cited Florida s so called stand your ground law allowing deadly force by civilians in some circumstances . . In a statement last night police Chief Bill Lee defended the investigation saying Officers were prohibited from making an arrest based on the facts and circumstances they had at the time . . And at that point you are authorized to make a decision to use force including deadly force if necessary to protect you and your family . . We live in a violent age and a lot of it has to do with something we do not really acknowledge anymore and that is the broad substance abuse problem drug abuse . . And we all know addicted people will sacrifice themselves their family and anyone else to that addiction . . Now the types of things that they have seen in media over the time of their childhood people are more destructive and complete in terms of the kinds of conflicts that you see . . And that does make it more dangerous for everyone . . I think over the long term we will have to see how much it actually means for the investigation . . I think what is important is that people were not simply calling for him to step down just because there has not been an arrest . . People were calling for him to step down because they were vastly and in my opinion legitimately displeased with how this investigation took place . . And part of what I find so encouraging is that folks like Dennis Baxley and the governor of Florida have themselves said that wait a second we need to rethink this law we need to revisit this . . So in a way I think that there are some look the shooting is a profound tragedy and you know there is still a lot more we need to learn but I do find it somewhat encouraging that this conversation has not been totally polarized at least not yet . . JEFFREY BROWN Well Ta Nehisi Coates pick up on that . . Criminologists have a number of theories to explain the decline . . First says Shawn Bushway a professor of criminal justice at the University at Albany in New York it is important to recognize that crime has been on a downward trend for more than a decade . . The recessions short term effects may have been overwhelmed by the longer term factors that have produced the long steady decline in crime . . Does it call into question the law . . Certainly in many people s mind it has . . What do you think . . REIHAN SALAM Indeed . . I am sympathetic to what both Donna and Dennis Baxley have said because I think that you know the law itself was really designed to protect people who are the victims of crime . .

Says Paul Ryan "wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students."
1
As for cutting education Priorities USA Action points to Ryans budget proposals for discretionary spending in general and Pell Grants in particular . . Ryans plan says the Pell Grant program is on an unsustainable path and it proposes limiting the growth of financial aid and focusing it on low income students Inside Higher Ed an online site devoted to higher education news wrote that Ryans plan does not propose specific spending levels for the dollar forty billion program Ryan says his plan maintains the maximum Pell Grant of dollar five thousand five hundred However it is possible that fewer students would be eligible for Pell Grants under Ryans plan since he calls for tighter eligibility requirements . . As we have written before it is certainly true that Ryans budget would require deep spending cuts . . If you listened to the Obama campaign you would think nothing made Mitt Romney happier than slashing Pell grants . . Romneys budget cuts Pell grants and dollar one hundred and seventy billion cut from Pell grants under Paul Ryan budget are two lines prominently displayed in the Obama campaigns new video Mitt Romney versus Reality Student Loans Edition In a TruthTeam memo the Obama campaign wrote that Romney praised the Ryan budget which would slash Pell Grants costing the average student nearly dollar one thousand per year Essentially the Obama campaign is hitting the Ryan plan here it is worth noting that although Romney backs the Ryan plan he did break with it earlier this week when he endorsed the one year extension of the current low interest rate for federal subsidized student loans . . So it is possible he will end up taking a different position on Pell Grants than the Ryan plan although he has not yet . . Ryans extreme budget plan which Mitt Romney has embraced would make deep spending cuts now to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy which would weaken the recovery and cost the economy jobs . . According to Harvard economist Jeffrey Liebman based on Mitt Romneys own projections on the impact of deep spending cuts on the economy Paul Ryans budget plan could cost the U.S. more than one million jobs . Obama taps Villaraigosa Longoria others to co chair campaign L.A. NOW Los Angeles Times . . This irresponsible spending serves only to put the program at greater risk of ultimately being unable to fulfill its promises to students . . New America Foundations Jason Delisle also notes that Obama has yet to put forward a long term plan to fund Pell Grants at their current levels . . The presidents proposal included only a one year fix for the massive dollar seven billion Pell Grant funding cliff . . The Ryan budget would cut Pell Grants in the sense that it proposes the maximum Pell Grant be dollar five thousand five hundred and fifty the level it is this year instead of rising to dollar five thousand six hundred and thirty five for next year as scheduled . . But the Obama administration is getting the dollar one thousand figure by this style of reasoning notes Politifact emphasis mine . . After the one year fix the presidents budget simply assumes that an extra dollar seven billion will materialize in the annual appropriation for Pell Grants each year . . But this extra funding must be offset by dollar seven billion in cuts to other programs funded with annual appropriations which the presidents budget does not specify . . The Department of Education would be cut by more than dollar one hundred and fifteen billion over a decade . . nine point six million students would see their Pell Grants fall by more than dollar one thousand in two thousand and fourteen and over the next decade over one million students would lose support altogether . . This would derail bipartisan education reforms and deeply undermine K twelve education and college opportunity . . Moreover the program is beginning to increasingly rely on mandatory funding to solve its discretionary shortfalls . . For instance the Department of Education warned in two thousand and twelve that without changes to reduce program costs Pell Grants would have an ending shortfall of dollar twenty point four billion . . Instead of making necessary reforms Congress again resorted to short term funding patchesa temporary answer that will not prevent another severe funding cliff for the program in the future . . But Ryans proposal does not cut Medicare spending it slows the growth of Medicare . . And it is speculation to say his plan would force seniors to pay more in premiums even though Priorities USA Action points to a report by a liberal leaning group that says it will . . In a March analysis of Ryans Medicare proposal the CBO said Ryans plan would spend substantially less than current law or the CBOs alternative fiscal scenario which takes into account likely congressional actions . . In an analysis of Romneys plan the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center considered the impact of those changes based on current policy and found about eleven percent of tax units would see their two thousand and fifteen taxes go up an average of nearly dollar nine hundred while seventy percent would get tax cuts averaging almost dollar four thousand three hundred A TPC table shows that the average low income taxpayer would see their taxes go up because Romney would not extend Obamas tax policies . . The tax increases reflect the expiration of three provisions enacted in two thousand and nine the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the expansion of the earned income credit and the child credit the tax center says noting however that Romney has said that the low and middle income groups will pay no larger shares of federal taxes than they do now . . So Romneys plan could result in low income taxpayers those earning up to dollar nineteen thousand three hundred and forty two in adjusted gross income paying more . . The statements it makes about Romneys business dealings and tax proposals contain some truth but do not tell the whole story . .

Says Obama doubled funding for the Pell Grant.
1
I have worked and saved and have a great family Case said . . But there is just no way I would be able to pay for school without the Pell Grant funding President Obama doubled . . Along with the administrations high profile health care overhaul its support for the Pell Grant was a centerpiece of Tuesdays event which focused on domestic policy and concluded with a keynote address from San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and a speech from First Lady Michelle Obama . . He is not further reducing eligibility would retain the entitlement funding portion and allow increases in the maximum grant that would track inflation and the rise in tuition costs . . The president claims to have more than doubled the total amount of funding available for Pell grants since he took office although the Student Loan Ranger has been disappointed that he has funded Pell grants in part by eliminating other helpful benefits such as the in school interest benefit on subsidized Stafford loans for graduate students and allowing students to get additional Pell grants for summer enrollment . . Read more about the candidates positions on college expenses . . Several aid experts suggested that the government explore changes in the Pell eligibility criteria that would allow federal funds to be targeted to the highest need students without raising the maximum grant since that also significantly increases the number of recipients over all . . Hauptman the independent analyst says that at the time the Obama administration raised the maximum Pell Grant in the stimulus legislation he had argued for giving additional dollar five hundred grants just to the two million lowest income Pell recipients . . Right now instead of a dollar twenty eight billion program in two thousand and ten you would have had an dollar eighteen billion program and a deficit of dollar ten billion less Hauptman said . . Speaker after speaker including members of Congress big city mayors like Castro and Obama supporters like Case and Davis mentioned that the president has doubled the amount of funding available for Pell Grants . . They criticized the Republican nominee Mitt Romney whose running mate Representative Paul Ryan is the author of a budget they said would devastate the program . . And while there is no way to guarantee that Romney would follow the Ryan template some of his recent statements about student debt suggest he may . . In contrast President Obama has been a strong supporter of Pell grants . . As the Student Loan Ranger noted in an earlier blog post Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney s education plan A Chance for Every Child Mitt Romney s Plan for Restoring the Promise of American Education is a bit vague in specifics . . When it comes to Pell grants for example it promises only to refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place the program on a responsible long term path that avoids future funding cliffs and last minute funding patches . . However Romney s recent selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate has spurred new questions about how a Romney administration would treat Pell grants compared to Obama in a second term . . Preserving the dollar five thousand five hundred and fifty grant required tradeoffs . . Those came partly in cuts to other federal financial aid programs graduate students can no longer take out federally subsidized loans and some benefits for subsidized undergraduate borrowers have been reduced but also in changes to the Pell Grant Program itself . . Eligibility changes that took effect this summer cut more than one hundred thousand students from the program including some part time students and those who have been enrolled for more than six semesters . . President Obama and advocates for students have trumpeted the increases which have certainly fueled growth in the number of Americans enrolling in college . . The way the Pell Grant Program is structured based primarily on family income and expected family contribution to pay for college raising the maximum grant is the only way to boost the amount of money flowing to the neediest students . . But it also has the effect of increasing the number of people who qualify for at least some Pell Grant funds . . The second factor to which the explosion of Pell is often attributed raised frequently in the context of increased scrutiny of for profit colleges by the Education Department and Senate Democrats is the rapid rise in the proportion of Pell Grant money flowing to commercial providers of higher education . . To explain his call for tougher scrutiny of for profit colleges Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa among others has frequently cited the fact that the institutions now receive about a quarter of all Pell Grant funds and student loan dollars even though they enroll about half that proportion of all students twelve percent . . In one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine two thousand for profit institutions received thirteen point one percent of Pell funds according to materials released by the senator while making up about four point three percent of all college students . . A two thousand and eight proposal by the Institute for Higher Education Policy suggested several possible changes aimed at directing Pell Grant aid to the neediest students including raising the Pell Grant minimum along with the maximum which would disqualify some of the comparatively higher income students and allowing additional Pell money to flow to students whose family incomes are so low that their expected family contribution falls below zero . . Students whose families have a negative EFC currently receive the same amount of aid as higher income students whose families EFC is zero the institute said at the time . . The speakers message Romney and Ryan would be far worse for federal financial aid . . it is a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell Grants or a nation that invests more in education said Castro in his keynote speech Tuesday night . .

All we want to do is go to work and be treated as equals leave behind gender based discrimination said Orrock an Atlanta Democrat . . His campaign said Perdue believes in equal pay for equal work . . That is the law and he has already supported that said his spokeswoman . . Establishes the Secretary of Labor s National Award for Pay Equity in the Workplace for an employer who has made a substantial effort to eliminate pay disparities between men and women . . Amends the Civil Rights Act of one thousand nine hundred and sixty four to require the EEOC to collect from employers pay information data regarding the sex race and national origin of employees for use in the enforcement of federal laws prohibiting pay discrimination . . Directs one the Commissioner of Labor Statistics to continue to collect data on woman workers in the Current Employment Statistics survey two the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to use specified types of methods in investigating compensation discrimination and in enforcing pay equity and three the Secretary to make accurate information on compensation discrimination readily available to the public . . The Senate is expected to call a vote in the coming weeks on the Paycheck Fairness Act an update on 1963s Equal Pay Act which made wage discrimination based on ones sex illegal . . With a reported seventy seven cents to the dollar pay gap between women and men respectively persisting nearly five decades later the Paycheck Fairness Act is designed to help those who believe they are victims of gender based wage discrimination by making wages more transparent by requiring that employers prove that wage discrepancies are tied to legitimate business qualifications and not gender and by prohibiting companies from taking retaliatory action against employees who raise concerns about gender based wage discrimination . . The bill supported by the Obama administration was passed by the House in January two thousand and nine only to be stalled in the Senate in November two thousand and ten and was reintroduced in both chambers in April two thousand and eleven . . Democratic National Committee Chair and Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz recently urged presumed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney to take a stand on the bill bringing it back into the political limelight and putting the pressure on Senate Dems to prioritize a vote on the legislation . . Proponents say that more must be done to close the pay gap between men and women particularly with much greater participation by women in the workforce since the Equal Pay Act became law . . Opponents say that the proposed new law misdiagnoses the problem questioning the data cited by its supporters and would unfairly harm small businesses as the economic recovery struggles to pick up steam . . Prohibits retaliation for inquiring about discussing or disclosing the wages of the employee or another employee in response to a complaint or charge or in furtherance of a sex discrimination investigation proceeding hearing or action or an investigation conducted by the employer . . Makes employers who violate sex discrimination prohibitions liable in a civil action for either compensatory or except for the federal government punitive damages . .

DEL VALLE TX The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association TSHA .DEL VALLE TEXAS . . Del Valle is on the Colorado River seven miles southeast of Austin in southeastern Travis County . . It was established in the mid 1870s and named for its location on Santiago Del Valle s land grant . . Del Valle was hurt by the onset of the Great Depression as the population fell from an estimated one hundred and fifty in one thousand nine hundred and twenty seven to twenty five in the early 1930s . . Children from the area attended schools in the Colorado and Hornsby Dunlap districts . . However the construction of Del Valle Army Air Field later known as Bergstrom Air Force Base in one thousand nine hundred and forty two brought a small increase in population as new support services moved into the area . . The community had one hundred and twenty five residents by the mid 1940s and two hundred residents by the mid 1950s . . The Colorado school district was renamed Del Valle in one thousand nine hundred and sixty two and the Del Valle community became the center of a large independent school district in one thousand nine hundred and sixty three . . Population estimates for Del Valle remained at three hundred from the early 1970s through one thousand nine hundred and ninety although the number of businesses in the community increased from twelve in one thousand nine hundred and seventy to thirty five in one thousand nine hundred and ninety . . To further refine the number of people who may be affected by food deserts a ten mile marker is used to consider food access in rural areas . . two point three million people live in low income rural areas that are more than ten miles from a supermarket . . Food deserts are defined as urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh healthy and affordable food . . A post office opened at Del Valle in one thousand eight hundred and seventy eight with William Givens as postmaster . . By the mid 1880s the community had three churches a school a steam gristmill a general store two cotton gins and fifty residents grain and cotton were the primary crops shipped by area farmers . . Instead of supermarkets and grocery stores these communities may have no food access or are served only by fast food restaurants and convenience stores that offer few healthy affordable food options . . The lack of access contributes to a poor diet and can lead to higher levels of obesity and other diet related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease . By one thousand nine hundred the population had grown to seventy five . .

Exposure to the electromagnetic fields from power lines "has been associated with childhood leukemia and other diseases."
1
To ensure that the EMF doses found inside the homes were the same as absorbed by the children one hundred of the children wore monitors for one week periods three times a year . . The study found no evidence that exposure to magnetic fields associated with the electricity supply increased risks for childhood leukemia cancers of the central nervous system or any other childhood cancer eleven . . The Science . . Other factors that have been studied for a possible link to childhood leukemia include . . Exposure to electromagnetic fields such as living near power lines . . Living near a nuclear power plant . . Exposure from power lines Although a study in one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine pointed to a possible association between living near electric power lines and childhood leukemia five more recent studies have had mixed findings . . Currently researchers conclude that there is little evidence that exposure to ELF EMFs from power lines causes leukemia brain tumors or any other cancers in children one six hundred and ten . . Exposure in homes Many studies have also looked for possible associations between magnetic fields measured in homes and residences and the risk of childhood cancers especially leukemia . . There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain tumors . . However studies of animals exposed to ELF EMFs have not provided any indications that ELF EMF exposure is associated with cancer one two . . What is the evidence for an association between magnetic field exposure and cancer in children . . Most of the research has focused on leukemia and brain tumors the two most common cancers in children . . Studies have examined associations of these cancers with living near power lines with magnetic fields in the home and with exposure of parents to high levels of magnetic fields in the workplace . . The journal Microwave News has consistently echoed Brodeur s message . . The list of conditions purportedly related to electromagnetic fields has grown to include Alzheimer s disease Lou Gehrig s disease brain tumors and breast cancer and multiple chemical sensitivity . . The alleged culprits include power lines microwaves radar video display terminals such as computer monitors electric blankets and household appliances in general . . In children . . In the studies that have looked at a possible link between ELF radiation from magnetic fields in the home and childhood leukemia the results have been mixed . . Still when the findings from these studies are combined a small increase in risk is seen for children at the highest exposure levels compared to those with the lowest exposure levels . . The results to date contain many inconsistencies but no large increases in risk have been found for any cancer in children or adults . . A number of epidemiological studies suggest small increases in risk of childhood leukemia with exposure to low frequency magnetic fields in the home . . However scientists have not generally concluded that these results indicate a cause effect relation between exposure to the fields and disease as opposed to artifacts in the study or effects unrelated to field exposure . . Its major goal is to identify causes of cancer . . IARC considered the evidence for ELF magnetic and electric fields separately and found limited evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of extremely low frequency magnetic fields in relation to childhood leukemia with inadequate evidence in relation to all other cancers . . It also found inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of extremely low frequency electric fields in humans as well as for the carcinogenicity of extremely low frequency magnetic fields in experimental animals . . The overall weight of evidence shows that exposure to fields at typical environmental levels does not increase the risk of any adverse outcome such as spontaneous abortions malformations low birth weight and congenital diseases . . There have been occasional reports of associations between health problems and presumed exposure to electromagnetic fields such as reports of prematurity and low birth weight in children of workers in the electronics industry but these have not been regarded by the scientific community as being necessarily caused by the field exposures as opposed to factors such as exposure to solvents . . Cataracts . . In this document the term magnetic field is used to indicate ELF radiation from a magnetic field while electrical field is used to mean ELF radiation from an electrical field . . The possible link between electromagnetic fields and cancer has been a subject of controversy for several decades . . it is not clear exactly how electromagnetic fields a form of low energy non ionizing radiation could increase cancer risk . . History . . Childhood leukemia can be used as an indicator that radiation exposure is sufficient to cause illness because radioactivity elevates rates of leukemia before it produce other forms of cancer . . Consequently childhood leukemia ought to be the easiest to detect . . Even if ELF EMFs were to increase an individuals risk of disease only slightly widespread exposure to ELF EMFs could translate to meaningful increased risks at the population level . . Several early epidemiologic studies raised the possibility of an association between certain cancers especially childhood cancers and ELF EMFs . . Most subsequent studies have not shown such an association but scientists have continued to investigate the possibility that one exists . . Power Lines Cancer and Fear NEJM .Editorial from The New England Journal of Medicine Power Lines Cancer and Fear .This article has no abstract the first one hundred words appear below . . Over the past eighteen years there has been considerable interest in the possible link between electromagnetic fields and cancer especially leukemia . . The story of this highly publicized research has been marked by mystery contradiction and confusion . . Electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings living things and most other materials . . Consequently magnetic fields are the component of ELF EMFs that are usually studied in relation to their possible health effects . . Why are ELF EMFs studied in relation to cancer . .

Says. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, once said, "Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up."
1
That said Barton has used the threat of global warming to combat something he hates even more wind energy . . In a two thousand and nine hearing Barton implied that wind is a finite resource and that harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up . . See how climate change is hitting the oceans . . Professor Steven Sherwood co Director of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales said the research was pretty solid . . This makes sense since at night the ground becomes much cooler than the air just a few hundred meters above the surface and the wind farms generate gentle turbulence near the ground that causes these to mix together thus the ground does not get quite as cool . . This same strategy is commonly used by fruit growers who fly helicopters over the orchards rather than windmills to combat early morning frosts . .Usually at night the air closer to the ground becomes colder when the sun goes down and the earth cools . . But on huge wind farms the motion of the turbines mixes the air higher in the atmosphere that is warmer pushing up the overall temperature . . Satellite data over a large area in Texas that is now covered by four of the world s largest wind farms found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built . . See TIME s special on the two thousand and ten World Energy Technologies Summit . Wind farms can cause climate change finds new study Telegraph .Wind farms can cause climate change according to new research that shows for the first time the new technology is already pushing up temperatures . . Barton asks Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu that probing question during an April two thousand and nine Energy Committee hearing in an exchange about the precious resource in Alaska . . Chu s answer about plate tectonics dumbed down so a five year old could understand it is completely lost on a smirking Barton who later gloats on Twitter I seemed to have baffled the Energy Sec with basic question Where does oil come from . . Actually those watching were the most baffled . . The yearly average horizontal flux of kinetic energy at the one hundred m hub heights of large wind turbines can be 1kWm two . . These large power fluxes enable the economic extraction of wind power but an array of wind turbines can not extract this power arbitrarily because turbines interfere with their neighbors by slowing local winds . . Most of the kinetic energy that drives wind turbines originates with the generation of available potential energy at planetary scales which fuels winds throughout the atmosphere . . 3A is superimposed on a much larger CO two induced warming . . In this case the polar cooling and low latitude warming from wind power tends to reduce aggregate impacts due to CO two induced warming which has the opposite pole to equator gradient even though the average temperature change due to wind power is zero . . A more systematic analysis would need to use the tools developed in integrated assessment models of climate change and it would need to account for the spatial distribution of the climatic changes and the sensitivity to climate impacts . . Barton is a long time denier of global warming . . he is called it a triumph over good sense and science and in two thousand and seven hearings he told Al Gore you are not just off a little . . you are totally wrong . . The direct climatic changes that are due to wind power may be beneficial because they can act to reduce rather than increase aggregate climate impacts . . For example assume that impacts are proportional to the local squared deviation of temperature from preindustrial means and that a small climate change due to wind power with the pattern of response shown in Fig . . The ratio of direct to indirect effects is relevant to decisions about implementing wind power at any scale if the objective is to mitigate climate change . . The direct impact of wind power is immediate whereas the indirect climatic benefit grows from zero with time as electricity from wind reduces CO two emissions and slows the growth of concentrations . . A comparison of the effects depends among other factors on i how impacts at different times and locations are aggregated ii the effectiveness of electricity from wind in reducing CO two emissions and iii the baseline CO two emission profile . . This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms . . It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds . . It is reported China is now erecting thirty six wind turbines every day and Texas is the largest producer of wind power in the US . . Our results may enable a comparison between the climate impacts due to wind power and the reduction in climatic impacts achieved by the substitution of wind for fossil fuels . . Global wind power capacity is growing by 8GWyr one making wind the fastest growing nonfossil source of primary energy one . . The cost of electricity from wind power is now forty dollars per MWh one at the best sites and costs are declining swiftly two . . Although the local environmental and aesthetic impacts of wind power have been explored there has been little assessment of the climatic impacts of wind turbines . . Wind power is a renewable resource but the rate of its renewal is finite and in some respects comparatively small . . However additional work is necessary to determine whether these impacts are large enough to be included routinely in assessments because preliminary estimates of the ratio of direct to indirect effects range from a few percent to near unity depending on assumptions . . Our analysis suggests that the climatic impacts of wind power may be nonnegligible but they do not allow a detailed quantitative evaluation of the climatic changes induced by extraction of wind power . .

ISIS is "now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi."

CNN reported in November that fighters loyal to ISIS had complete control of the city of Derna which has a population of about one hundred thousand and is situated not far from the Egyptian border . . Jihadists with allegiance to ISIS had also expanded their presence westward along the Libyan coast forming chapters in cities including Benghazi Sirte and even Tripoli the capital according to Noman Benotman a former Libyan jihadist now involved in counterterrorism for the Quilliam Foundation . . In an example of the group s spreading reach a Libyan branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed ten people including one American . . According to Aaron Zelin a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy the Islamic State s new province in Libya could have some level of viability at least in the short term because fighters there are well positioned to fund themselves through trafficking smuggling and other black market activities . . Libyan fighters loyal to ISIS have expanded their presence westwards along the coast forming chapters in al Bayda Benghazi where the Islamist umbrella group Ansar al Shariah already holds sway Sirte al Khums and even Tripoli Benotman told CNN . . The Derna wing of the Islamic State in Libya was the prime suspect in a suicide bombing in early November in Tobruk the temporary home of Libya s internationally recognized parliament near the Egyptian border . . Local tribes are reluctant to move against them because people have relatives who have joined their ranks Benotman told CNN . . Egypt which has strongly backed the anti Islamist coalition in Tobruk has grown increasingly concerned about the ISIS presence in eastern Libya . . In July gunmen suspected of being part of Ansar Beit al Maqdis an Egyptian jihadi group attacked an Egyptian desert border post killing twenty one soldiers . . internationally recognised government that was ousted from the capital not long after the two thousand and fourteen election Both backed by a loose alliance of militias focused on local interests . . Benghazi the second city and headquarters of the two thousand and eleven Revolution is largely in the hands of Islamist fighters some with links to al Qaeda . . the second city and headquarters of the two thousand and eleven Revolution is largely in the hands of Islamist fighters some with links to al Qaeda Misrata the third city and main port is also loyal to the Tripoli authorities . . In his view the group is rapidly expanding and may threaten Europe though the U.S. government assessment is less certain some American intelligence officials believe Nayed may be overstating his case but U.S. ambassador to Libya Deborah Jones asked in a February four tweet whether a divided Libya can withstand ISIS . . Indeed the group has dramatically increased its physical and media presence in Libya since the Islamic Youth Shura Council IYSC of Darnah pledged allegiance to it last October after which ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi recognized the Libyan provinces of Barqa Cyrenaica Tripolitania and Fezzan as belonging to his self styled caliphate . . At the same time the group s supporters online have been aggressively recruiting while making the case for ISIS expansion in Libya and a new strategy in North Africa . . IS encroaches on al Qaeda . . Ansar al Sharia based in Benghazi was the first hardline Islamist militia to openly denounce the government . . For years the government did little to stop the assassinations and bombings which were being carried out in Benghazi by unknown groups . . ISIS ACTIVITIES IN LIBYA . . At the very least ISIS has left its footprints in Benghazi Sirte Tripoli and portions of southern Libya . . The group has broadcast very little from its media office for Fezzan Province though it did claim responsibility for the January three attack on a Libyan army checkpoint outside of Soukna that left over ten soldiers dead . . Ansar al Shariahs Libyan branch is accused of carrying out the two thousand and twelve fatal attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi . . The group has solid footing in Benghazi and the city of Derna where it had earlier declared an Islamic emirate This weekend the group reportedly held a parade in Derna holding ISIS flags . . It has yet to issue a formal statement about its relationship with ISIS . . The struggle for power currently includes forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar a rouge general who has launched a campaign against jihadi groups with the backing of Libya s frail government two rival governments and several Islamist militias . ISIS comes to Libya CNN .Fighters loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria are now in complete control of a city in Libya . . CNN The black flag of ISIS flies over government buildings . . Ansar Al Sharia . . Ansar al Sharia are regarded as an offshoot of al Qaeda in Libya their goal is the creation of an islamic theocracy . . They are regarded as the most radical militia in Libya and supposedly were behind the terrorist attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in which ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed . . Egypt . . In Egypt last week militants formed a group called Jund al Khilafah in Egypt aligning itself with ISIS and apparently as the name suggests modeled after the Algerian extremist group . . In its initial statement the group vowed to attack U.S. interests and worshipers of the cross . . The February 17th Martyrs Brigade . . This islamist militia is regarded as the strongest and best equiped group in eastern Libya . . It comprises supposedly up to three thousand five hundred fighters but other sources claim numbers exceeding twelve thousand militiamen . . However Ansar al Charia Derna has never claimed responsibility for those attacks . . Ansar al Charia Derna is believed to have cooperated with Ansar al Charia Benghazi in the preparation of the first suicide attacks in Libya on twenty two December two thousand and thirteen in Barsis near Benghazi . .

"With the exception of baby formula, the federal government does not require any food to carry an expiration date, and state laws vary widely."

Manufacturers provide dating to help consumers and retailers decide when food is of best quality . . Except for infant formula dates are not an indicator of the products safety and are not required by Federal law . . Top of Page . . Use of either a Sell By or Expiration EXP date is not a Federal regulation but may be required as defined by the egg laws in the state where the eggs are marketed . . Some state egg laws do not allow the use of a sell by date . . Many eggs reach stores only a few days after the hen lays them . . The FDA receives many questions from manufacturers distributors and importers about the proper labeling of their food products . . This guidance is a summary of the required statements that must appear on food labels under these laws and their regulations . . To help minimize legal action and delays it is recommended that manufacturers and importers become fully informed about the applicable laws and regulations before offering foods for distribution in the United States . . This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration s FDA s current thinking on this topic . . It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public . . You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations . . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires a use by date on infant formula . . The U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA does not require quality or food safety date labels for products under its purview . . However the USDA does require a pack date for poultry products and thermally processed commercially sterile products to help identify product lots and facilitate trace back activities in the event of an outbreak of foodborne illness see nine CFR three hundred and eighty one point one two six and four hundred and thirty one point two e respectively . . The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act NLEA which amended the FD C Act requires most foods to bear nutrition labeling and requires food labels that bear nutrient content claims and certain health messages to comply with specific requirements . . Although final regulations have been established and are reflected in this guidance regulations are frequently changed . . When the dating is up to the manufacturer the product may still be sold legally after the date passes but in practice most processors will recall such products or accept them for return . . The expiration date does not mean that the product is unfit for consumption beyond it . . Anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks leeway is allowed so that with proper storage the consumer can assume the product will remain wholesome for a time in the home . . Sell by date is most important for retailers telling them when they should take a product off the shelves . . However it does not mean that the food is no longer safe to eat . . Expiration date means a product should not be eaten after the date listed throw it out . . Confusion over the meaning of dates applied to food products can result in consumers discarding wholesome food . . In an effort to reduce food waste it is important that consumers understand that the dates applied to food are for quality and not for safety . . Food products are safe to consume past the date on the label and regardless of the date consumers should evaluate the quality of the food product prior to its consumption . . Best if used by date refers to the quality of the product not its safety . . In short it means that the product will maintain its maximum quality until that date but it can still be safe to eat for a certain amount of time depending on the kind of product after the date has passed . Food Product Dating . . Sealtest milk may be dated from eight to twelve days from the time of processing depending on the results of periodic samplings from various plants . . Asked why the city s regulation which until one thousand nine hundred and seventy eight limited milk to sixty six hours on sale after pasteurization is stricter Mr. Reisberg said There are too many variables and we have no guarantee that proper care has been taken . . He emphasized that temperature was as important a factor as time . . It is the responsibility for the food industry to remain current with the legal requirements for food labeling . . All new regulations are published in the Federal Register FR prior to their effective date and compiled annually in Title twenty one of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR . . In certain areas some dairy products are dated according to local restrictions otherwise the date is determined by the manufacturer . . In New York City fluid milk and cream are dated according to a regulation established by the municipal Department of Health and it is illegal to sell them beyond that date . . Milk should not stand in direct light since this can destroy riboflavin vitamin B2 . . Though freezing will not affect the nutrients it is not recommended because some protein will coagulate and flake while these small particles do not mean that the milk is spoiled it may not be as satisfactory to use . . Cream . . Those contaminants are especially dangerous to children under five elderly people and those whose immunity has been compromised by illnesses such as cancer or HIV . . At the same time the authors of a review paper published this week in the journal Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety stressed that the lack of understanding of different date labeling terms may in fact encourage people to throw food away too soon and therefore contribute to food waste that is already a significant problem in developed countries . . The authors called for increased collaboration between food manufacturers and regulatory agencies to provide a better and more uniform food labeling system . .

"The pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break.

Keeping this tax loophole which leads to folks who are doing very well paying lower rates than their secretaries is not in any demonstrable way improving our economy he said echoing a theme of the billionaire Warren E. Buffett . . On Thursday Senate Democrats including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York once a behind the scenes protector of the tax break and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called on Republicans to support ending it as part of a budget compromise that would allow caps on military and domestic spending to be lifted . . Mr. Ellis said the real goal of Democrats was to end tax breaks for capital gains altogether . . In a letter Democratic Sens . . Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Al Franken of Minnesota Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island urged the Obama administration to complete proposed rules that would limit investment managers ability to get the tax break on part of their income . . ... . Many voters are frustrated by years of stagnant wages and growing income inequality which has been made worse by the tax codes preferences . . For Mr. Bush in particular media attention to the populism of his attack on the carried interest break obscured an important fact His proposal to eliminate the break is one provision in a broader tax plan that over all would cut individual and corporate taxes so deeply that it was uncertain whether people involved in private equity would pay more taxes or less . . At issue with carried interest is the tax codes longstanding favorable treatment of the generous compensation given to hedge fund managers private equity partners and venture capitalists as their share of the gains on money they invest for others institutions as well as wealthy partnerships . . This is an issue that should be considered only in the context of comprehensive tax reform and until then nothing is ruled in or out said Brendan Buck spokesman for Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin at the House Ways and Means Committee . . Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is also holding out for a broad overhaul of the tax code that would end myriad tax breaks so ordinary income tax rates could be lowered . . Doing that he said would be a simpler and more effective way to alleviate concerns that some might have . Some of Wall Streets heaviest hitters approved . . And predictably Democrats led by President Obama and the partys presidential candidates piled on because the tax the rich idea had been theirs to begin with . . But far from defeated the proponents of the carried interest tax break are rallying to its defense and counting on the Republican controlled Congress to have their back . . it is been a while since people on the right have had to think about this said Ryan Ellis tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform the group founded by Grover Norquist the self appointed arbiter of Republicans anti tax purity . . Recently both men wrote columns supporting lower taxes for carried interest Mr. Ellis in Forbes magazine its Trump like lead paragraph Taxing carried interest as ordinary income is a really dumb idea and Mr. Norquist in USA Today . . Trump started it Mr. Ellis said in an interview . . Also contrary to Mr. Elliss prediction George Pataki former governor of New York joined Mr. Trumps side . . I would not give a special tax break to the Wall Street fat cats Mr. Pataki said adding it is hard for me to say I am with Donald Trump on anything but on this issue I agree with him . . Disagreeing with Mr. Trump were the Republican presidential candidates Gov . . Our concern is that there is a lot of misinformation out there Mr. Maloney said . . For Mr. Trump the real estate mogul and Mr. Bush who briefly had a career in private equity their opposition to the tax break for a niche of the wealthiest Americans is perhaps a politically advantageous position in this populist moment despite its departure from Republican orthodoxy . . it is funny that Trump probably built a portion of his fortune from receiving carried interest tax breaks in his real estate syndication partnerships years ago . . When President Obama called for repeal of carried interest for investment managers in his two presidential campaigns and annual budget proposals Senator Chuck Schumer D NY objected saying it singled out the finance industry hedge funds and private equity which obviously were concentrated in his state and New York City . .

Says the Democratic Party created a debate schedule "to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates."
0
Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. who has been gaining on Clinton in the polls has also said he would like to see more debates . . The DNC has maintained that the schedule of six debates will allow ample opportunity for Democratic voters to size up the candidates . . A party spokeswoman did not respond to a request for additional comment Saturday . . I feel like your all s voices are not getting heard the way they could be if there were more of these events . . WASSERMAN SCHULTZ Well we believe strongly that a combination of opportunities for voters to see our candidates and make sure that we are not pulling them off the campaign trail every other day to prepare for a debate . . We have an early primary state window for a reason so voters can get that up close and personal look and make sure that unlike in later primaries where there is a big collection on multiple Tuesdays and harder for the candidates to spend that close up time that we are giving those candidates and the voters an opportunity to have that really up close and personal kick the tires time . . The party committees decision to limit Presidential candidates to six debates with a threat of exclusion for any candidate who participates in any non DNC sanctioned debate is a mistake Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Rybak wrote in their statement . . It limits the ability of the American people to benefit from a strong transparent vigorous debate between our Presidential candidates as they make the important decision of who will be our Democratic Presidential nominee they wrote . . As vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee we are calling for several more debates than the six currently scheduled and withdrawing the proposed sanctions against candidates who choose to participate in non DNC sanctioned debates they wrote . . Brian there is no number of debates that will satisfy everyone . . So I did my best to make sure along with my staff and along with our debate partners to come up with a schedule that we felt was going to allow for the to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates . . STELTER I agree with you . . It was about as far as you could get from the small tent big circus reality show the Republican debates have turned into where Donald Trump sets the tone and the others rush to try to say something just as outrageous and just as wrong . . The enthusiasm for our candidates is reflected in our debate audiences . . Our first debate in Las Vegas broadcast on CNN brought in a record fifteen point eight million viewers the sixth biggest non sport cable broadcast in U.S. history . . there is no indication that you may add some to the calendar in the next couple of months . . WASSERMAN SCHULTZ You know Brian it is really important that we have the candidates have a variety of opportunities to be seen by voters . . We have had candidate forums and we will be having additional forums going forward . . Donna Brazile the campaign manager for Vice President Al Gore in two thousand said that though she sympathized with both sides of the issue increasing the number of total forums as opposed to just the debates should be addressed especially to counter the noise and energy generated by the broad Republican field . . Ray Buckley the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party and another vice chair said that he thinks there will be many chances for the candidates to get their message out . DNC chairwoman heckled over debate schedule at New Hampshire convention .MANCHESTER N.H. a The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee was heckled here on Saturday as she addressed a gathering of state party activists some of whom feel strongly that there .MANCHESTER N.H The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee was heckled here on Saturday as she addressed a gathering of state party activists some of whom feel strongly that there should be more presidential debates than the national party has sanctioned . . In a statement Ben Doernberg the founder of AllowDebate a grass roots group pushing for more debates said on Saturday that it is increasingly clear that Debbie Wasserman Schultz stands alone against the right of presidential candidates to debate freely . Debbie Wasserman Schultz under fire in Las Vegas over Democratic debate schedule rules Naked Politics . . Former Maryland governor Martin O Malley one of the Democratic presidential hopefuls has been particularly vocal about the debate schedule accusing the DNC of circling the wagons to limit the exposure of the party s front runner Hillary Rodham Clinton . . On Saturday he told reporters here that it is party malpractice to let Republicans get all the exposure they have for their debates without scheduling more Democratic encounters . . He called the Democratic calendar a one woman edict by Wasserman Schultz . . More eyeballs on Donald Trumps racist and xenophobic antics Ted Cruzs extremism Ben Carsons lack of foreign policy knowledge Marco Rubios opposition to abortion in all circumstances and Chris Christies overcompensating bluster is not necessarily a good thing for the GOP . . Heres the bottom line we do not need a reality television star and a cast of obnoxious contestants waiting to be voted off in order to generate enthusiasm in our candidates and debates . . we are breaking records with viewers tuning in for a substantive discussion of the issues . . So we are very proud to be hosting this debate over Martin Luther King weekend . . And it gives us an opportunity to talk about the issues that are critically important for the African American community and to helping people reach the middle class and draw the really stark and clear contrast that we have from the Republican debate in North Charleston which was blocks from the Mother Emanuel Church and yet all of their candidates criticize President Obama for having the nerve to suggest and adopt policy that would prevent people who should not have guns from being able to get them . .

"The African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse."
2
The report was commissioned by the National Association of Real Estate Brokers NAREB . . According to the report African Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling homeownership rates and loss of jobs . . Further African American homeownership peaked in two thousand and four indicating that the housing crisis hit this community earlier than the nation as a whole . . For white households factoring in home equity helped wealth figures grow by only about two and a half times to two hundred and forty four thousand . . But it is not just the loss of home equity that caused these outsized losses for black households . . The study also points to predatory loans that put owners into homes with high interest mortgages and unaffordable balloon payment structureswhere they then defaulted as home values collapseda practice that was disproportionately perpetrated against the poor and communities of color . . White black wealth gap widens to near record levels .The Great Recession hit all Americans hard but only whites have seen their wealth rise during the recent recovery . . .The Great Recession hit all Americans hard but only whites have seen their wealth rise during the recent recovery . . And that is widening the already massive wealth gap between whites and other racial and ethnic groups to near record levels . . Wealth inequality has widened along racial ethnic lines since end of Great Recession Pew Research Center .The median wealth of white households was thirteen times the wealth of black households and ten times that of Hispanic households in two thousand and thirteen compared with eight and nine times respectively in two thousand and ten . . .The Great Recession fueled by the crises in the housing and financial markets was universally hard on the net worth of American families . . But even as the economic recovery has begun to mend asset prices not all households have benefited alike and wealth inequality has widened along racial and ethnic lines . . Thus minority households may not have replenished their savings as much as white households or they may have had to draw down their savings even more during the recovery . . Also financial assets such as stocks have recovered in value more quickly than housing since the recession ended . . White households are much more likely than minority households to own stocks directly or indirectly through retirement accounts . . Meanwhile the homeownership rate among minority households decreased from fifty point six percent in two thousand and ten to forty seven point four percent in two thousand and thirteen a slippage of six point five percent . . While the current wealth gaps are higher than at the beginning of the recession they are not at their highest levels as recorded by the Feds survey . . Peak values for the wealth ratios were recorded in the one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine survey seventeen for the white to black ratio and fourteen for the white to Hispanic ratio . . Thus they were in better position to benefit from the recovery in financial markets . . All American households since the recovery have started to reduce their ownership of key assets such as homes stocks and business equity . . The typical household had a net worth of dollar eighty one thousand four hundred in two thousand and thirteen according to the Feds survey almost the same as what it was in two thousand and ten when the median net worth of U.S. households was dollar eighty two thousand three hundred values expressed in two thousand and thirteen dollars . . The stability in household wealth follows a dramatic drop during the Great Recession . . From two thousand and seven to two thousand and ten the median net worth of American families decreased by thirty nine point four percent from dollar one hundred and thirty five thousand seven hundred to dollar eighty two thousand three hundred . . Asians and other racial groups are not separately identified in the public use versions of the Feds survey . . Leaving aside race and ethnicity the net worth of American families overall the difference between the values of their assets and liabilities held steady during the economic recovery . . They recommend focusing on borrowers as opposed to focusing entirely on institutions ensuring adequate credit for rental housing development and establishing a housing and community infrastructure bank . . African Americans have been greatly affected by the housing crisis and the communitys wealth building potential is at risk . . Nevertheless the African American community continues to grow both in population and purchasing power highlighting the need for housing policies that will benefit a diverse America . . For all families white black and Hispanic median wealth is still less than its pre recession level . . A number of factors seem responsible for the widening of the wealth gaps during the economic recovery . . As the Federal Reserve notes the median income of minority households blacks Hispanics and other non whites combined fell nine percent from its two thousand and ten to two thousand and thirteen surveys compared with a decrease of one percent for non Hispanic white households . . So minority households may not have been able to sock away as much or may have had to use more of their savings to cover expenses . . Also the financial markets have rebounded much more than housing in recent years . . Since whites are more likely to own stocks they have seen a bigger wealth boost . . Related five disturbing stats on black white inequality . . Much of the focus in recent years has been the growth in income inequality with the Top one percent capturing most of the post Recession gains . . But wealth inequality is also troubling . . But those values of the ratios may be anomalies driven by fluctuations in the wealth of the poorest those with net worth less than dollar five hundred . . Otherwise the racial and ethnic wealth gaps in two thousand and thirteen are at or about their highest levels observed in the thirty years for which we have data .

As a sign of "extraordinary progress," "there are half as many (primary-age) children out of school today as there were 15 years ago."
1
Over the last thirty years extreme poverty has been cut in half . . Boys and girls are enrolling in primary school at nearly equal rates and there are half as many children out of school today as there were fifteen years ago . . The number of children who die from preventable deaths has been cut in half since one thousand nine hundred and ninety . . I am truly honored by your words but also by your partnership which I think sends the important signal to all of us about what we can do . . I also see in this room a lot of faces who have worked for USAID for many many years . . Many legends many people who built the foundation of the Agency I am proud to serve today . . Even as I work with the men and women of USAID and I want to say it is an absolute privilege to do so I have also got an eye to the challenges we face as a broader community . . I have been in this field for over thirty five years now which means that Senator Perdue actually can not be my father because he is really not that old but I honestly can not remember a moment as pivotal as the one that we face now . . I think everyone in the room knows that this is a moment of extraordinary progress . . Even with all the gains we have seen that is no easy task . . And when you step back to see the full picture it is almost as if the good and the bad the signs of progress and the dangerous trends are in a dead heat with one balanced against the other . . Now our work at this moment is made easier because there is a global and national consensus that development matters . . That means we need to adapt our systems and institutions for a rapidly changing world . . This year we have at least two opportunities to do just that . . First in May the United States will participate in the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul . . So adolescents are twice as likely to be out of school as their younger counterparts . . The report shows that as children get older the risk that they will never start school or will drop out increases . . In total one hundred and twenty one million children and adolescents have never started school or dropped out despite the international communitys promise to achieve universal primary education by two thousand and fifteen . . And these are countries with a solid head start they began with conditions that helped expedite the process like a history of working government or a relatively literate populace . . Given all of the enormous difficulties there are some who would say the hard work is not worth it . . But tell that to President Santos of Colombia which fifteen years ago was on the brink of being declared a failed state . . we are acting on the fact that development solutions are manifold . . I think many of you know that for decades this field has been characterized by the flavor of the month phenomenon and depending on who you ask and I have been at this for a long time so I have been through all of these the one really critical key to development has at different times been rural agriculture good governance infrastructure human capital the enabling environment democratic systems gender equity or innovation . . The fact of the matter is that development requires all of these and more . . And in too many cases like in South Sudan governments make an effective response even harder because those charged to lead have turned their backs on the people who need them most . . We are today feeding more than one million people in South Sudan each month and responding to El Nino on four continents just as we will continue to respond wherever there is need . . The American people expect it and respond themselves with generosity . . Data show that there has been almost no progress in reducing this number since two thousand and seven . . Children living in conflict child labourers and those facing discrimination based on ethnicity gender and disability are the most marginalised . . So the fact is that when we work together we are a powerful force for change . . that is why I am very glad to have all of you by my side as we work to lock in what we have accomplished and to meet the challenges that are ahead of us . . And I am enormously proud to lead USAID and very confident about what we can achieve together . . The Agency we need and the world deserves . . If we meet these three challenges if we make the choice to invest in the future and not just the right now we can usher in a new era of progress . . If we persist through the inevitable setbacks and shocks of a countrys transformation in years to come we will have capable and responsible partners . . USAID has long since abandoned the notion that the solution to development is assistance alone . . Trust me assistance is important I am cramming for my first ever budget hearings and I will make a very strong case but we have also learned that how many dollars we spend is neither the exclusive measure of our commitment nor the means by which we measure success . . Part of that is because we have adjusted to a new landscape . . But try it with limited funding too few donors security constraints and ever growing expectations and most people would simply give up . . But our people do not and we owe them our thanks and a commitment to pursue change that lasts at least as long as these transitions take . . Progress can not be measured in four or eight year increments . . The success of Feed the Future has much to do with the fact that African leaders acted on their own to call for an increase in spending on agriculture and that every country should have its own food security plan . .

"Attorney General Roy Cooper refuses to do his job" by not defending House Bill 2 in a lawsuit.
1
Republican leaders pointed to a message from Cooper s campaign just last week encouraging supporters to sign a petition against politically motivated voting laws . . The attorney general claims it is his duty to defend the state yet campaigns against the very laws he is defending in court Mollie Young a spokeswoman for House Speaker Tim Moore said in a statement . . But Grayson Kelley the state Justice Department s chief deputy attorney general calls the legislature s spending on private attorneys wasteful and says agency lawyers are fully capable of handling the cases on their own . . Even so he vows to defend them in court . . Cooper in his 13th year as the state s elected attorney general says he will defend in court laws he personally opposes . . But he says he will also continue to criticize the public policy behind those laws . . That followed moves in previous years to establish a formal legal standing for House and Senate leaders and divert dollar three hundred thousand away from the Attorney General s Office to pay for the defense of legislation . . Amy Auth a spokeswoman for Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger said the increased funding for litigation resulted from Attorney General Coopers failure to do his job . . Although the attorney general position is constitutional it is up to lawmakers to decide the attorney general s duties given their power over the state s purse strings says Eddie Speas who was general counsel to former Gov . . The amount dwarfs spending on outside counsel by any governor or legislature in the last fifteen years . . Cooper s top deputies say Department of Justice lawyers are perfectly capable of defending the state despite the attorney general s views and that they continue to do so despite the unwanted legal help . . Yet GOP leaders in the House and the Senate say the payments were necessary to properly defend policies that continue to face legal challenges from activist groups . . In a statement Monday morning McCrory spokesperson Graham Wilson defended the use of outside lawyers saying Cooper s statements made them a necessity . . The attorney general has compromised his ability to represent our state with his continued decision to put politics over the job he was elected to do Wilson said . . As long as that continues the governor will take the appropriate steps to defend the State of North Carolina . . In that case Cooper was separately representing the Council of State . . The firm of Robinson Bradshaw and Hinson worked on McCrory s lawsuit against legislative leaders Berger and Moore fellow Republicans in a dispute over who has the right to make appointments to the new Coal Ash Management Commission . . At a cost of more than dollar five hundred thousand through October the Governor s Office needed outside counsel because the Attorney General s Office was obligated to defend the law passed by the legislature and by proxy the commission itself . . Bob Hall executive director of the government watchdog group Democracy North Carolina said Cooper s past statements give the Republican leadership sound bites to justify what they are doing . . But he said the question both the legislature and the governor need to answer is whether Justice Department lawyers are actually doing their jobs . . It does seem like so much of it is viewed through a partisan lens that we have got to bring our cannons to the walls of the ship and fire away and we can not trust the established tools to do the job for us Hall said . . Those costs peaked in two thousand and fifteen when legislative leaders paid law firms about dollar two point two million with more than dollar eight hundred thousand still due as of early November . . Legislators hired their own lawyers when Cooper announced in two thousand and fourteen he would no longer defend a constitutional ban on gay marriage pointing to a federal appeals court that ruled a similar measure in Virginia violated the U.S. Constitution . . The U.S. Supreme Court a year later reiterated such bans on gay marriage are unconstitutional . . Cooper has called the law regressive and says it restricts voting rights . . But he says his office will be in state and federal court to defend it . As attorney general GOP clash spending on private lawyers skyrockets WRAL.com .Financial data show state leaders have racked up almost dollar seven million in legal bills for private lawyers in the last five years . . The South Carolina firm of lawyer Butch Bowers billed the governor s office dollar six hundred and seventy eight thousand through October for work on the voter ID case . . McCrory also sought private lawyers at a cost of about dollar five thousand so far to bypass the Attorney General s Office and augment his own full time general counsel Bob Stephens in a public records lawsuit filed by WRAL News The News Observer and other groups Full disclosure WRAL Reporter Tyler Dukes is a participant in ongoing mediation in this suit . . Years before he announced it officially Attorney General Roy Cooper s nascent campaign for governor was the worst kept secret in North Carolina politics . . The Democrat s open criticism of the Republican legislature s policies riled the right fueling skepticism among GOP leaders about Cooper s ability to defend the state against a slew of lawsuits challenging their new measures . . That last measure which includes requirements for voters to present photo identification at the polls prompted McCrory to hire his own private lawyer as well . . Speas whose firm is involved in the voter ID case and several others against the state said he was unable to recall a similar case with so many attorneys . . It does seem to me that the case is overstaffed with lawyers at public expense he said . . These current practices could be said to diminish that role Speas said . . Chief Deputy Attorney General Grayson Kelley points out the money being spent on private lawyers is not replacing Department of Justice lawyers . .

Under a new federal regulation, it will cost Pinellas County "$31 million to fix a single ditch."
1
The eighty six page proposed rule appended with almost four hundred more pages of data would put under the EPA and CoEs jurisdictional thumbs such waters as a drainage ditch in Maricopa County Arizona that carried water five times from one thousand nine hundred and ninety three to two thousand in one hundred and eighty two rain events for a total elapsed time of flow of seven point five hours . . A park ditch in Pinellas County Florida of the type in which you may see teenagers skateboarding would cost taxpayers there over dollar thirty one million just to maintain for hypothetical fishable swimmable uses under the proposed rule . . The administration is attempting this power grab despite the rule of law and precedent laid out by the Supreme Court in the two thousand and six case of Rapanos v. United States which interpreted the term waters of the United States as including only relatively permanent standing or flowing bodies of water . . The EPA proposes six categories in which to fit these new waters of the U.S. many of which employ terms like neighboring riparian and tributary which have never been defined by Congress or court precedent . . Even more alarming is the seventh catch all category that includes on a case specific basis other waters that have a significant nexus to a traditional navigable water Imagine the very real scenario this would replicate over and over in every state A private landowner with a body of water or even a dry field ditch or creek bed on his property would have to rely on the ad hoc evaluation of a federal field agent to determine if the land is under the EPAs authority and the laborious permitting processes of the CWA . . Forget about the time and money spent to get this answer and if affirmative to comply . . Rule Of Law How Obamas EPA Is Trying To Regulate Your Creek Beds And Ditches The Daily Caller .If its new rule comes into effect property owners could be on the hook for costly Clean Water Act permitting .Have you ever seen some water runoff in your yard during a hard rain and attempted to put a boat in it for an afternoon cruise . . I did not think so . . In practice the rule means that developers can no longer pave over wetlands and oil companies can no longer dump pollution into streams unhindered restoring Clean Water Act protections to more than half the nation s streams supporters say . . But opponents call the rule an example of federal overreach and fear a steady uptick in federal regulation of nearly every stream and ditch on rural lands . . Thursday s ruling by U.S. District Judge Ralph Erickson in Fargo N.D. is a significant and rightful win for states rights said Rep. Jason Chaffetz R Utah chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee . . They were joined by their AG colleagues from Alabama Alaska Georgia Kansas Louisiana North Dakota South Carolina and South Dakota and six Republican Governors signed on some of whom do not have a Republican AG defending their states authority to manage their natural resources . . This proposed definition would result in millions of additional acres of land and water coming under federal jurisdiction and would create chaos and confusion for private citizens and landowners Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia said . . Farmers and landowners should not have to worry that the federal government will show up at their door claiming that they failed to go through a costly federal permit process before using property that had little to no water such as a small pond ditch or often dry streambed . . Texas AG and Republican nominee for Governor of Texas Greg Abbott wrote in August a pointed letter to the EPA and made clear that i f the proposed rule is not withdrawn and is made final then the State of Texas will have no choice but to challenge the rule in federal court where it will surely be struck down as violating federal law exceeding the agencys statutory authority and contravening the U.S. Constitution . . Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens agrees recently stating that the new rule would drastically and unlawfully expand federal control over Georgias water resources . . Such a thing is almost as ridiculous as the continued actions by the Obama Administration and such runoff is not far from the type of water it is trying to put under the EPAs control . . Earlier this year the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers CoE proposed a new regulation under the Clean Water Act CWA that would sweep in as waters of the U.S. millions of new miles of rivers and streams and more alarming areas of land that are dry most of the year and are not near a body of water . . .The Environmental Protection Agency says it is going forward with a new federal rule to protect small streams tributaries and wetlands despite a court ruling that blocked the measure in thirteen central and Western states . . The EPA says the rule which took effect Friday in more than three dozen states will safeguard drinking water for millions of Americans . . Opponents pledged to continue to fight the rule emboldened by a federal court decision Thursday that blocked it from Alaska to Arkansas . . The EPA counters that the rule merely clarifies which smaller waterways fall under federal protection after two Supreme Court rulings left the reach of the Clean Water Act uncertain . . Those decisions in two thousand and one and two thousand and six left sixty percent of the nation s streams and millions of acres of wetlands without clear federal protection according to EPA causing confusion for landowners and government officials . . The new rule would force a permitting process only if a business or landowner took steps that would pollute or destroy the affected waters those with a direct and significant connection to larger bodies of water downstream that are already protected . .

"Today California is kicking our butt, creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas."
2
Rick Perry liked to gig big bad liberal California for its economic woes . . Today California is kicking our butt creating more jobs and more economic growth than Texas he said . . Maybe what we need to do is trade in California Gov . . Furthermore consider this graph showing the employment to population ratio in the two states . . Again we can see that the employment share is higher in Texas than in California . . Thus all in all I would say that focusing on the total number of people employed is misleading due to the different population sizes of the two states . . I hope you did not think I forgot about this fact check . . What do you make of the cited California edges on Texas in growth in GDP and per capita personal income . . g. . . But once we consider differences in population and labor force makeup a different picture emerges . . For example consider this graph representing the unemployment rate in the two states where you can see that the unemployment rate and therefore the number of unemployed people is higher in California than in Texas . . So on that front Texas looks better than California . . By both the unemployment rate a standard measure of labor market health as well as the employment to population ratio Texas s labor market actually looks healthier than California s . . Please let me know if you have any follow up questions . . July fourteen two thousand and sixteen . . it is true that California has more employed persons than in Texas as you can see in this graph but it is also true that California has had a larger population than Texas since before one thousand nine hundred and forty see this graph . . In some quarters there were politics involved he said . . But there is a way for folks to work together in a positive direction in getting more of the bad loans sold to nonprofits rather than to Wall Street banks he said . . Political scientist Jones said Castro is unlikely to be Clintons running mate pick but not because of the mortgages sold to Wall Street . . New State by State GDP Gains and Losses Released Route Fifty . . The states with the largest economies based on real GDP in two thousand and fifteen are California Texas New York Florida Illinois and Pennsylvania . .

Rices Jones said both men probably expect more success for their party in two thousand and twenty and two thousand and twenty two than anytime sooner . .

Throughout the day both brothers carefully talked up Texas Democrats prospects of making incremental gains this fall taking pains not to raise expectations too high . . You can not kid yourself . .

"There are approximately 18,000 (police) departments in the United States."

Earlier this year in an assessment of policing in greater the St. Louis area which includes Ferguson Wexler s group recommended just that . . St. Louis County contains a patchwork of police departments many of which have jurisdiction over very small areas the review found . . This has led to confusion and distrust among residents who often feel targeted and harassed by police officers and the municipal court system . . Half of the nearly eighteen thousand law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have fewer than ten officers according to the Justice Department s Bureau of Justice Statistics . . Nearly three quarters of agencies have fewer than twenty five officers patrolling counties and towns where standards are uneven or non existent . . So many problems of organizational quality control are made worse by the tiny size of most local police agencies University of Maryland criminologist Lawrence Sherman told the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing earlier this year . . But there is a strong argument to be made to consolidating smaller agencies to form regional consortiums . . Consolidation or the complete outsourcing of police work has been the subject of intense debate in many communities including Hightstown N.J. where the ten officer police department has been the target of lawsuits and separate criticism over its long unfilled director position . . At this point we just want the town to have an open meeting to confront the issue said J.P. Gibbons a member of local advocacy group Voices of Hightstown . . Details . Half of the nation s nearly eighteen thousand agencies have fewer than ten police officers . . Kevin Johnson . . Complaints are down it is working out . . At a time when policing operations in America are the focus of perhaps unprecedented scrutiny analysts say the largest component of local law enforcement small town agencies should consider following Sorrento s lead . . No other country in the world has this model of de centralized policing said Chuck Wexler executive director of the law enforcement think tank Police Executive Research Forum . . Among the group s recommendations strategic consolidations of police agencies advocating for the merger of about twenty small agencies into three so called policing clusters . . Bigger is by no means better and large agencies have their own set of challenges Wexler said . . The Uniform Crime Reporting UCR Program has been the starting place for law enforcement executives students of criminal justice researchers members of the media and the public at large seeking information on crime in the nation . . The program was conceived in one thousand nine hundred and twenty nine by the International Association of Chiefs of Police to meet the need for reliable uniform crime statistics for the nation . . In one thousand nine hundred and thirty the FBI was tasked with collecting publishing and archiving those statistics . . The panel was established in the aftermath of the riots in Ferguson where the operations of the town s modest fifty three officer department were excoriated in a March review by the Justice Department . . That review which concluded that the local department engaged in a broad pattern of racially biased enforcement also raised broader questions about the capacity of small communities to carry out crucial public safety responsibilities . . population one thousand five hundred Mike Lambert learned just how bad his police department really was . . Local judges in an extraordinary two thousand and thirteen meeting with the town s new chief executive said the six officer police force had no credibility in the courts . . Corruption was rampant residents were being harassed . . Today four annual publications Crime in the United States National Incident Based Reporting System Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted and Hate Crime Statistics are produced from data received from over eighteen thousand city university college county state tribal and federal law enforcement agencies voluntarily participating in the program . . The crime data are submitted either through a state UCR Program or directly to the FBIs UCR Program . . LIke the mayor the chief is concerned about the town s ability to draw candidates to small town policing when you can make more at McDonalds . . And he also does not like the prospect of turning over public safety duties to a larger agency like the Washington County Sheriff s Department a ninety person agency that covers six hundred square miles . . It worries me that you will not have the personal connections that we have now the chief said . Smaller agencies the White House panel concluded often lack the resources for training and equipment accessible to larger departments . . it is no accident Sherman said in an interview that the law enforcement problems that emerged last summer came from a small police department like Ferguson . . So bad that the department lost its insurance carrier prompting last year s town vote to shutter the police department for good after more than a half century of operations . . With few options Lambert did what many law enforcement analysts now suggest may be a more appropriate public safety alternative for a vast network of small communities with extremely limited public safety resources . . The mayor struck a deal with the larger better trained and equipped Ascension Parish Sheriff s Department . . And once they are fastened to the eyeglass frames of the town s four full time officers the tiny community tucked in a scenic crease of the Blue Ridge Mountains will represent the latest convert to a law enforcement technology that has swept the country since last year s racially charged shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson Mo . . The cameras however are not Damascus only link to a national re examination of policing amid a continuing series of controversial police encounters that have fractured public trust in law enforcement since the eruption in Missouri . . Since two thousand and seven when then Damascus police chief Anthony Tony Richardson was busted for dealing methamphetamines the town has churned through four different chiefs including two others who had what Mayor Jack McCrady described as zipper problems . .

Democrats "are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office."

State of Illinois Education Funding Analyzing Trends The Civic Federation . . Whether the State of Illinois has spent more or less on education in the last five years has recently been the subject of intense debate . . This blog post examines various factors that affect the calculation of education spending trends and expands on the Civic Federations recent report on the States enacted budget for FY2015 . . In turn Quinn insists it actually rose nearly dollar five hundred million since he assumed office in two thousand and nine . . Determining who is right depends on whether you count an influx of federal stimulus dollars in the two thousand and ten fiscal year the first budget that the Quinn administration crafted . . The health of the states schools is considered an important issue in the November election and each candidate is arguing that he would be the best defender of the schoolhouse . . Of that total dollar one point five billion consisted of State Fiscal Stabilization Fund money designed to help state and local governments stabilize their budgets by minimizing budgetary cuts . . The GAO found that Illinois had disbursed about dollar one point two billion to local school districts but only dollar one hundred and sixty five point six million had been spent by the districts . . According to the GAO when spending by local districts is substantially below amounts received by a stateas in Illinoisthe state might be having cash management problems . . Under the Governors revised FY2011 budget the State would borrow dollar eight point nine billion for operations and end the year with a total deficit of roughly dollar four hundred and fifty three million . . After using dollar one point four five billion of borrowing in FY2012 the deficit would remain at the same level . . The next chart shows how the Governors budget plans for FY2011 and FY2012 would affect the States General Funds accounts payable . . Numbers provided to The Associated Press by the Illinois State Board of Education show that in two thousand and nine the last year before Quinn replaced his impeached predecessor Rod Blagojevich state spending on preschool through 12th grade was dollar seven point four billion . . This year it is dollar six point eight billion . . The following table shows actual spending by the Board of Education from FY2011 through FY2013 estimated spending in FY2014 and appropriations in FY2015 . . It should be noted that actual spending in FY2015 could be less than the spending authority granted through appropriationsor more if supplemental appropriations are approved later in the year . . Total education spending grows by dollar six hundred and six million from dollar nine point three billion in FY2011 to dollar nine point nine billion in FY2015 mainly due to increases in federal funding . . As previously discussed on this blog personal income tax rates were increased from three percent to five percent effective on January one two thousand and eleven and corporate tax rates were increased from four point eight percent to seven percent . . The increases are scheduled to start being rolled back on January one two thousand and fifteen . . Illinois corporations also pay a two point five percent Personal Property Replacement Tax . . The projected increase in state revenues in FY2012 is expected to be partially offset by a dollar six hundred and sixty two million decline in federal revenues . . Federal revenues are expected to drop partly because of the end of federal stimulus funding on June thirty two thousand and eleven that had been provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of two thousand and nine . . Total General Funds expenditures in FY2012 are expected to increase by dollar one point seven billion or five point one percent from dollar thirty three point seven billion in FY2011 to dollar thirty five point four billion in FY2012 . . The increase is mainly due to an increase of dollar one point six billion or six point seven percent in net appropriations from dollar twenty four point three billion in FY2011 to dollar twenty five point nine billion in FY2012 . . Net appropriations subtract out appropriations that remain unspent because they are held back at the Governors direction because expenses do not reach budgeted levels or because checks issued by the State have not been cashed . . The states statutorily required contributions to its pension funds are also expected to increase by dollar six hundred and seventy five million or seventeen point two percent from dollar three point nine billion in FY2011 to dollar four point six billion in FY2012 . . It shuffled dollar one billion in federal funds into Illinois schools that year and dollar seven hundred and ninety one million the following year . . Quinn campaign spokeswoman Brooke Anderson says the stimulus money should not be counted in the state mix of funding even though the State Board of Education has routinely reported stimulus funding lumped in with state assistance when discussing spending for schools . Governor Proposes FY2012 Budget with More Borrowing and Spending The Civic Federation . . The State expects to eventually obtain a total of up to dollar fourteen billion Governor Pat Quinn told the General Assembly in a report dated September eleven two thousand and nine . . Across the country the GAO found that as of September eleven two thousand and nine the Treasury had given out dollar forty eight billion of the projected dollar forty nine billion in federal stimulus funds for federal FY2009 which ends September thirty . . About three quarters of the payments have been through increased Medicaid reimbursements and education stabilization funding . . However Illinois officials expect the State to enact legislation to increase tax revenues and to move into FY2011 without the need for additional fiscal stabilization funds from ARRA the GAO said . . Governor Quinn had proposed an income tax increase for state FY2010 which runs through June thirty but could not get support from the General Assembly for the controversial fifty percent rate increase . .

A fifteen year old case of a deceased N.C. military veteran asked by his neighborhoods developer to take down an American flag flying on a pole on his lawn is now campaign fodder in Richard Burr and Deborah Ross fight for a U.S. Senate seat . . The dispute dates back to Ross time as executive director of North Carolinas state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union . . McClatchy reported in August about the fifteen year old flag flap . . Soon after the issue arose the veteran was able to get neighborhood covenants changed so he could fly the flag without the ACLUs help . . The case here today forces recognition of the costs to which those beliefs commit us . . It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt he said . . Chief Justice William Rehnquist in his dissent said that the flag is not simply another idea or point of view competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas . . The Court said in the one thousand nine hundred and seven case of Halter v. Nebraska that two businessmen could not sell beer that had flag labels on the bottles upholding a state law . . Then a one thousand nine hundred and thirty one case set the first precedent for the use of a flag in an act of symbolic speech under the First Amendment when the Court struck down a California law that banned the flying of a red flag to protest against the government . .

"The vast majority of people that got insurance under President Obama's Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, got it through Medicaid."
1
twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act new estimates show HHS.gov . . A new report released today finds that the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have resulted in an estimated twenty million people gaining health insurance coverage between the passage of the law in two thousand and ten and early 2016an historic reduction in the uninsured . . The reports model controls for general economic conditions i.e employment status preexisting trends geographic location and demographic changes so its estimates focus on the decline in the number of uninsured Americans specifically associated with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act . . Thanks to the Affordable Care Act twenty million Americans have gained health care coverage said HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell . . We have seen progress in the last six years that the country has sought for generations . . Simply put this is wrong and a misleading characterization of our work and that of others who have studied the ACAs impact . . The ACA expanded health insurance to more than twenty million Americans through several different approaches including Medicaid expansion subsidies for private coverage the elimination of the ban on preexisting conditions and an individual mandate . . In recent research with our colleague Molly Frean we examined how these various parts of the ACA produced increases in insurance coverage in two thousand and fourteen two thousand and fifteen . . OPINION JONATHAN GRUBER AND BENJAMIN SOMMERS . . As the new administration and Republican allies in Congress plan their agenda for two thousand and seventeen repeal of the Affordable Care Act is front and center . . Senate Republicans last week put out a policy statement reiterating their plans to roll back the law and claimed in part based on our research that this would have only modest effects on the number of Americans without health insurance . . Americans with insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace or through their employers have benefited from better coverage and a reduction in the growth in health care costs . . According to todays report six point one million uninsured young adults ages nineteen to twenty five have gained health insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act . . This is especially important because young adults were particularly likely to be uninsured before the law went into effect . . We found that about forty percent of the expansion of coverage was due to the new tax credits for individuals to purchase private insurance on the ACAs insurance marketplaces twenty percent occurred among the individuals made newly eligible for Medicaid in two thousand and fourteen and ten percent was via increased Medicaid coverage in early adopter states that expanded Medicaid before two thousand and fourteen with ACA funds . . The remaining thirty percent was due to what some have called the woodwork effect individuals who were already eligible for Medicaid before the ACA but came out of the woodwork once the law was implemented . . Coverage gains for young adults began in two thousand and ten because of the provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows children to stay on their parents health insurance plan until they are twenty six years of age . . two point three million young adults gained coverage from two thousand and ten through the start of Open Enrollment in October two thousand and thirteen due to the provision that allows people under age twenty six to stay on their parents plan . . After a repeal of the ACA many of these individuals would likely lose their newfound coverage and return to the ranks of the uninsured . . In addition we find that approximately one million uninsured children have gained coverage from Medicaid since two thousand and fourteen many of them because their parents now newly eligible for Medicaid themselves were more likely to sign their families up for coverage . . Indeed research by one of us found that when parents lose Medicaid coverage children often follow suit . . Welfare reform ended this automatic qualification requiring individuals who had been getting cash welfare to separately apply for Medicaid for the first time . . Medicaid eligibility did not change there was no reason those on Medicaid could not reenroll . . But many confused by the changes or dissuaded by the increased hassle did not . . Those provisions include Medicaid expansion Health Insurance Marketplace coverage and changes in private insurance that allow young adults to stay on their parents health insurance plans and require plans to cover people with pre existing health conditions . . If parents are disenrolled after an ACA repeal many children will return to being uninsured . . Advertisement . . Opponents of the ACA have offered various arguments for why they want to repeal the law and debating the laws costs and benefits is appropriate . . But politicians should not deceive themselves or the public into thinking that a repeal of the law will not lead millions of Americans adults and children to lose their health insurance with devastating consequences for many of them . The law simplified the Medicaid application process and made it so that most people could enroll solely based on low incomes without cumbersome tests of their assets . . The ACA also motivated enrollment through several mechanisms including the individual mandate massive enrollment outreach in most states and press coverage of the fact that Medicaid was now more broadly available . . Repeal would have the opposite effect . . Welfare reform of the mid 1990s provides a cautionary precedent . . Before reform those who received cash welfare automatically qualified for Medicaid . . Advertisement . . Critics of the law have recently used our results to argue that since only one third of the Medicaid coverage gains arose from the new expansions a repeal would have limited effects on overall coverage rates . . This is wrong on many counts . . Separately the National Health Interview Survey has estimated the uninsured rate was nine point one percent for the overall U.S. population including those under the age of eighteen and over the age of sixty four in the first nine months of two thousand and fifteen . .

"Under ‘Trumpcare,’" domestic violence and sexual assault "could be considered pre-existing conditions."
1
Correction This story originally stated that rape is considered a pre existing condition in the AHCA . . It has been updated to reflect that conditions stemming from sexual assault and domestic violence such as PTSD and certain STDs could be considered preexisting conditions not sexual assault itself . . Watch House GOP members admit they have not read the health care bill they just passed . However all but six states have laws on the books forbidding the practice of discriminating against preexisting conditions related to sexual assault . . In addition to PTSD stemming from sexual assault and domestic violence other conditions like postpartum depression and having gotten a cesarean section could also be considered preexisting conditions . . The amendment also reads Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender . . An amendment in the GOP health care reform bill would allow states to grant insurance companies the ability to deny coverage to patients based on their personal medical histories including if they suffered from disorders like PTSD after they were sexually assaulted . . Before Obamacare rape survivors who sought treatment for physical and mental injuries could be denied health care later on and a House Judiciary Panel survey suggested that the practice was common . . Under Obamacare patients were guaranteed the right to receive coverage at the same rate despite their personal medical histories . . Those costs would go up just as steeply in the two biggest counties Racine and Kenosha in Ryans southern Wisconsin district . . Wisconsin is also a state where the explosive issue of pre existing conditions could come into play . .

The role of case management in substance abuse treatment services for women and their children . . J Psychoactive Drugs . . This sort of waiver would affect a limited population people who buy insurance through the individual market and who have had a lapse in coverage . . Republicans argue those people would be protected because states that get a waiver would have to set up high risk pools to insure people with pre existing conditions . . But many analysts believe the law would still leave those people more vulnerable to cost increases that could make their plans unaffordable . . That argument will be hotly debated in the months to come . . But now that they are in power Republicans know they will be held accountable for whatever system emerges from this debate and that health care is a frighteningly potent political issue . .

The UN agency defines the total unemployment rate as the percentage of the labour force population ages fifteen and older that is not in paid employment or self employed but is available for work and has taken steps to seek paid employment or self employment . .

Consequently the OSCE is responding to security challenges . . Hug added that the recent attacks constitute deliberate hostile interference with the work of the OSCE SMM that amounts to censorship and reminded the public that the SMM is an unarmed civilian monitoring mission and was invited by Ukraine as an impartial monitor . . According to the OSCE permission to monitor in Ukraine constitutes de facto permission by all OSCE members including Russia . . The destruction of a camera deployed by the SMM on seven August in support of the potential DFS safety zone demonstrates contempt for this important humanitarian initiative and for the many people on both sides of the contact line who stand to benefit from its installation . . The determination of the sides to prevent the OSCE SMM from fulfilling its mandate has been abundantly demonstrated throughout the process of installing this camera . . Before arriving at the Donetsk Filtration Station the monitoring equipment was held for several hours at the entry exit checkpoint in Olenivka and during the installation shots were fired at the contracted workers and the SMM monitors accompanying them . . Related to disengagement areas and mines UXO . .

The SMM did not consider it safe to proceed and informed the JCCC . . The Mission also expects the sides to identify those responsible for the incident and to ensure appropriate disciplinary measures are implemented . . This camera is one of many remote observation tools deployed by the SMM in eastern Ukraine as part of the enhanced Technical Monitoring Project that the Mission has been rolling out in the current mandate . . It improves the Missions ability to monitor and to overcome the widespread restrictions and other impediments imposed on the Mission by the sides . . The SMMs mandate provides for safe and secure access throughout Ukraine . . All signatories of the Package of Measures have agreed on the need for this safe and secure access that restriction of the SMMs freedom of movement constitutes a violation and on the need for rapid response to these violations . . They have also agreed that the JCCC should contribute to such response and co ordinate mine clearance . . The SMMs mandate provides for safe and secure access throughout Ukraine . .

They have also agreed that the JCCC should contribute to such response and co ordinate mine clearance . . Following this incident the SMM invites the Joint Centre for Control and Co ordination JCCC to put forward a joint proposal on how it can contribute more effectively towards a comprehensive and sustainable cessation of fire particularly in these proposed safety zones . . The SMM expects forces and formations on both sides of the contact line to co operate with the JCCC to that end . .

Related to disengagement areas and mines UXO . . Armed LPR members positioned on the southern side of the Zolote disengagement area told the SMM that they could not guarantee the safety of the Mission due to the possible presence of mines and UXO . . Hug stated that aside from demonstrating OSCE monitors bravery and commitment to their mission recent violence discounts accusations that the OSCE is not operating in violent areas . . He added that the allegations are insulting to those who risk their lives every day and further stated that monitors security is the OSCEs highest priority . . On July twenty six a five member OSCE monitoring patrol came under machine gun mortar and grenade fire as it attempted to cross a checkpoint along the contact line in Shchastya . . Hug reported This happened even though movement was agreed and coordinated in advance by both sides of the conflict . . After sustaining fire for approximately ninety minutes the OSCE team escaped uninjured . . One SMM convoy was allowed to proceed . . The armed DPR members however stopped the second one and told it that it must wait for an escort . . The escort in the form of a green military type van arrived and accompanied the SMM to Yasynuvata . . Despite the relative calm over the past week during which only a handful of ceasefire violations were recorded in the Donetsk region and fewer violations occurred in Luhansk over the past week monitors recorded one hundred and twenty explosions near the international airport area in Donetsk . .

Unrestricted Fund Balance Above Formal Policy Requirement . . In some cases governments can find themselves in a position with an amount of unrestricted fund balance in the general fund over their formal policy reserve requirement even after taking into account potential financial risks in the foreseeable future . . Amounts over the formal policy may reflect a structural trend in which case governments should consider a policy as to how this would be addressed . . Nevertheless GFOA recommends at a minimum that general purpose governments regardless of size maintain unrestricted budgetary fund balance in their general fund of no less than two months of regular general fund operating revenues or regular general fund operating expenditures.5 The choice of revenues or expenditures as a basis of comparison may be dictated by what is more predictable in a governments particular circumstances.6 Furthermore a governments particular situation often may require a level of unrestricted fund balance in the general fund significantly in excess of this recommended minimum level . . In any case such measures should be applied within the context of long term forecasting thereby avoiding the risk of placing too much emphasis upon the level of unrestricted fund balance in the general fund at any one time . . In establishing a policy governing the level of unrestricted fund balance in the general fund a government should consider a variety of factors including . . In that context the fund balance policy should . . Define the time period within which and contingencies for which fund balances will be used Describe how the governments expenditure and or revenue levels will be adjusted to match any new economic realities that are behind the use of fund balance as a financing bridge Describe the time period over which the components of fund balance will be replenished and the means by which they will be replenished . . Generally governments should seek to replenish their fund balances within one to three years of use . . For example governments that may be vulnerable to natural disasters more dependent on a volatile revenue source or potentially subject to cuts in state aid and or federal grants may need to maintain a higher level in the unrestricted fund balance . . Articulating these risks in a fund balance policy makes it easier to explain to stakeholders the rationale for a seemingly higher than normal level of fund balance that protects taxpayers and employees from unexpected changes in financial condition . . The predictability of its revenues and the volatility of its expenditures i.e higher levels of unrestricted fund balance may be needed if significant revenue sources are subject to unpredictable fluctuations or if operating expenditures are highly volatile Its perceived exposure to significant one time outlays e.g disasters immediate capital needs state budget cuts The potential drain upon general fund resources from other funds as well as the availability of resources in other funds The potential impact on the entitys bond ratings and the corresponding increased cost of borrowed funds Commitments and assignments i.e governments may wish to maintain higher levels of unrestricted fund balance to compensate for any portion of unrestricted fund balance already committed or assigned by the government for a specific purpose . . Governments may deem it appropriate to exclude from consideration resources that have been committed or assigned to some other purpose and focus on unassigned fund balance rather than on unrestricted fund balance . . Fund Balance Guidelines for the General Fund Government Finance Officers Association . . GFOA recommends that governments establish a formal policy on the level of unrestricted fund balance that should be maintained in the general fund for GAAP and budgetary purposes.3 Such a guideline should be set by the appropriate policy body and articulate a framework and process for how the government would increase or decrease the level of unrestricted fund balance over a specific time period.4 In particular governments should provide broad guidance in the policy for how resources will be directed to replenish fund balance should the balance fall below the level prescribed . . Appropriate Level . . Use and Replenishment . . The fund balance policy should define conditions warranting its use and if a fund balance falls below the governments policy level a solid plan to replenish it . . To compile this Fiscal Health Index we looked at one hundred and sixteen U.S. . . To compile this Fiscal Health Index we looked at one hundred and sixteen U.S. cities with populations greater than two hundred thousand using data from two thousand and fifteen financial reports issued by the cities themselves . . Our scoring system is described in a new working paper . . Additionally an education or communication strategy or at a minimum explanation of large changes in fund balance is encouraged . . In all cases use of those funds should be prohibited as a funding source for ongoing recurring expenditures . Specifically factors influencing the replenishment time horizon include . . The budgetary reasons behind the fund balance targets Recovering from an extreme event Political continuity Financial planning time horizons Long term forecasts and economic conditions External financing expectations . . Revenue sources that would typically be looked to for replenishment of a fund balance include nonrecurring revenues budget surpluses and excess resources in other funds if legally permissible and there is a defensible rationale . . The adequacy of unrestricted fund balance in the general fund should take into account each governments own unique circumstances . . one the ratio of a citys general fund balance to its expenditures forty percent weighting . . two the ratio of its long term obligations including OPEB but excluding pensions to total government wide revenues thirty percent weighting . . three the ratio of actuarially determined pension contributions to total government wide revenues ten percent weighting . .

Johnson s use of the word if seemed to be irrelevant because he had already laid on the innuendo thick and fast to impugn Russia . . We do not know exactly what has taken place in Salisbury but if it is as bad as it looks it is another crime in the litany of crimes that we can lay at Russia s door intoned Johnson with affected gravity and notable haste to implicate Moscow . . Moscow has dismissed the rampant speculation as wild allegations aimed at whipping up anti Russian sentiment among the British public . . Given their inveterate anti Russian agenda the British authorities have much more vested interest in seeing Skripal poisoned than the Kremlin ever would . .

Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning and its foreign ministry said May s remarks Wednesday constitute an unprecedented flagrant provocation that undermines the foundations of normal dialogue between our countries . . It added that Russia s response measure will not be long in coming . . May said Moscow had treated the affair with sarcasm contempt and defiance She clashed with Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn who questioned the lack of multilateralism in her approach but the Prime Minister received broad support across party lines including from Labor lawmakers . . it is an open demonstration of this Russian terrorism . . The Russian government is telling people who are thinking about revealing more secrets that they can expect the same fate . . Experts also said that the use of Novichok showed that Russia wanted to make known that it was behind the attack . . British officials have powers under criminal finance legislation to start moving on Russian assets . . The overall impact of what we are planning to do will have serious repercussions for Russia a senior British official told VOA . . May had given an ultimatum to the Kremlin to explain the poisoning . . Mirzayanov also said serious long term health risks remain for hundreds of Salisbury residents who may have been exposed to trace contamination because of their proximity as the attack unfolded or who brushed past the Skripals in a pub and a restaurant they visited . . Asked about the advice given by British public health officials including washing clothes and wiping down possessions he said Sure it is useful but not enough absolutely not . . British health officials say the risk to the general public is low But their comments are not reassuring say locals who are seeing increasing numbers of police and army specialists clothed in protective suits deployed in the town of forty thousand . . Why would a has been Russian agent who has been living quietly and undisturbed for nearly a decade in England be targeted on the eve of Russia s presidential elections by Kremlin avengers . .

We must stand ready to take much more extensive measures . . Health risks . .

Says George Soros has "unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power" in Texas this fall.
1
I am proud to have the support of the Texas Justice and Public Safety PAC along with other national and local organizations who believe that it is time to have a true progressive Democrat in the Bexar County District Attorneys Office . . The latest effort by Soros to swing the race in Gonzales favor in the March six primary comes after he kicked in more than dollar sixty thousand to the campaign in January bringing the political financiers total in kind contributions to dollar nine hundred and fifty eight thousand . . Soros PAC supplied Gonzales campaign with twenty two donations all but two of which came in February that totaled dollar eight hundred and ninety seven thousand . . Gonzales jumped into what became a bitter and divisive race after LaHood in front of a judge threatened to destroy his legal practice . . His race was aided by nearly dollar one million in donations from liberal hedge fund magnate George Soros . . LaHood struck back with lurid attack ads that claimed Soros owned Gonzales while deriding his commitment to not prosecute prostitution . . Billionaire George Soros again has stepped into the Harris County district attorney s race with a half million dollar advertising buy on behalf of Democrat Kim Ogg . . The latest Soros contribution arrives just days after the Ogg campaign filed a quarterly finance report showing she received nearly dollar one hundred and thirty five thousand in campaign contributions from a PAC supported by Steve Mostyn another major Democratic financier in Texas . . The filing also shows a smaller dollar eleven thousand in kind polling donation given in August from the Soros funded Texas Safety Justice PAC . . Soros contributions to LaHood DA challenger nears dollar one million ExpressNews.com . . Earlier this month a PAC backed by the billionaire gave nearly dollar nine hundred thousand mostly in the form of in kind contributions to Joe Gonzales according to reports filed Monda . . Liberal billionaire George Soros earlier this month poured nearly dollar nine hundred thousand into the campaign of Joe Gonzales a Democrat running to unseat Bexar County District Attorney Nicholas Nico LaHood in the party primary according to reports filed Monday . . What do we know about George Soros LaHood said in the video . . We know that George Soros is a billionaire that has purchased at least ten other district attorneys offices around the country not to mention other political positions . . A longtime backer of foreign political causes including the growth of democratic institutions to supplant authoritarian regimes Soros turned his attention to the U.S. in the mid 2000s . . The race contained everything from bitter personal feuding to substance based discussions about criminal justice reform . . LaHoods already controversial profile drew outside attention from the start yet the race made further noise in conservative circles with the release of campaign finance reports showing Soros had supplied Gonzales through a political action committee with about dollar nine hundred thousand worth of ads . . LaHood chalked the loss up to Soros influence . . He added My opponent could not rub two pennies together with his local fundraising efforts so he had to go out of state . . Gonzales received dollar thirteen thousand four hundred in cash contributions through the end of the year before Soros PAC began contributing to his campaign . . He raised another dollar five thousand two hundred through january twenty five . . One Texas victor Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg reaped more than dollar five hundred and eighty three thousand from Soros in her race to unseat an establishment Republican . . Soros scored another upset in two thousand and seventeen spending dollar one point four million in Philadelphia to help progressive civil rights attorney Larry Krasner trounce a Republican DA . . Gonzales embraced Soros support on Monday . . The outsized support from personal injury attorney Thomas J. Henry helped push LaHood to unlikely victory but now the district attorney might be getting a taste of his own medicine . . Liberal billionaire George Soros through an organization called the Texas Justice Public Safety PAC has contributed dollar six thousand in research to the campaign of Joe Gonzales LaHoods opponent in the March six Democratic primary . . It was unclear on Monday whether the Soros funded PAC would continue to support Gonzales . . I believe the voters saw right through that . . During the last six weeks of the campaign Gonzales received about dollar nine hundred thousand from Soros allowing him to extend the LaHood Trump strategy to TV ads . . Gonzales acknowledged Soros contributions in his victory speech . . It continued Soros has been targeting district attorney races across the country and is shelling out MILLIONS to attack and defeat our conservative leaders The email went on to mention the Bexar County district attorney race . . Soros has often funded Democratic candidates running against Republicans though in Harris County he initially supported the campaign of Morris Overstreet who lost in the two thousand and sixteen Democratic primary to Kim Ogg . . Soros later contributed more than dollar five hundred and eighty three thousand to Oggs successful general election win . . The eighty seven year old hedge fund tycoon though has a record of sweeping reform minded candidates to victory . . In two thousand and sixteen Soros spent nearly dollar eleven million to help twelve Democratic candidates in district attorney races across the country ten won . . The contributions coming from the Soros backed Texas Justice Safety political action committee came in the form of in kind contributions mostly for mailers media buys including two TV ads and related expenditures . . This campaign is about true criminal justice reform Gonzales said Tuesday . . what is the secret to a winning campaign the email began . . If you are a liberal running for district attorney a truckload of cash from far left billionaire George Soros seems to do the trick . .

We need to get rid of them because they do not speak for us . . We tried doing it on the cheap Pleines said . . We tried to have effective law enforcement utilizing as few supervisors as we possibly can and look where it is gotten us . . I think that approach has proven not to be a good one . you have got to understand that the police department is being demonized all twelve thousand five hundred of them when it is only thirty to fifty of them that are doing wrong in a year . .

"Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."

To an LGBTQ advocacy group . . Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Dawson traveled the state Tuesday decrying the money the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs passed in grants to Free2Be a Huntsville organization that was set up to prevent bullying and domestic violence against gay and lesbian students and adults . . It was a worthy sounding organization that checked all the boxes needed to receive government grants and between two thousand and fourteen and today starting under Gov . . Still Robinson was able to right his life in Huntsville for a while . . In two thousand and ten he went to an Alabama AIDS advocacy group and pitched his plan for helping LGBTQ teens . . He was given office space and began to solicit grants . . In two thousand and seventeen ADECA administered federal grants totaling approximately dollar one hundred and sixty eight million six hundred and sixty five thousand five hundred and forty . . The views espoused by Free2Be nor the extension of a grant to the program do not represent Governor Kay Iveys personal views and simply represent a requirement and demand from the federal government . Robert Bentley and escalating under Ivey the group received dollar one point seven million in federal money before shutting its doors Friday . . The group became known in Huntsville as a go to point for information and comment on gay and lesbian issues . . In FY two thousand and eighteen the cap was set at dollar four point four three six billion . . In FY two thousand and eighteen more than dollar three point four billion from the Fund was awarded to thousands of local victim assistance programs across the country and to help compensate victims in every state for crime related losses . . These awards surpass every other single year grant amount in the programs thirty four year history . . There are many in Huntsville who argue the organization has done a lot of good that it provided a voice for young people who desperately needed one . . Free2Be s federal tax records also filed under the name GLBT Advocacy Youth Services Inc. indicated the group served hundreds of victims of domestic violence and bullying each year . . The group last year was sued by the Alabama Department of Labor for failure to provide worker s compensation insurance to employees but later provided proof of insurance and the suit was dropped . . The grant awarded to Free2Be is overseen by ADECA using funds given by and regulated by the federal government from criminal fines and forfeitures not taxpayer dollars . . In two thousand and thirteen Alabama was notified that at least ten percent of the grant dollars given to the state under the Victims of Crime Act VOCA must be given to agencies that provide services to underserved populations . . Additionally Alabama was notified that grants must be extended to organizations which seek to provide victim services to the LGBTQ population . . WOMAN When there are really big criminal cases generally against corporations there are criminal fines and they are usually in the millions of dollars . . MAN To use federal criminal fines not tax money that was a major step forward to support the efforts states were making to provide financial assistance to crime victims . . WOMAN The Crime Victims Fund is distributed by the Office for Victims of Crime . . The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders not from tax dollars . . As of two thousand and eighteen the Fund balance is over dollar twelve billion and includes deposits from federal criminal fines forfeited bail bonds penalties and special assessments collected by U.S . . Attorneys Offices federal courts and the Federal Bureau of Prisons . . With the Victim Assistance Programs there is an opportunity if not a motivation for creativity especially at the local level . . WOMAN Without the money that comes in from the Crime Victims Fund many victim assistance programs probably would not be able to exist . . WOMAN This money from the Office for Victims of Crime has made a huge difference in our state . Questions still remain . . How did Free2Be become the go to agency for Alabama bullying grants . . Was its money spent properly and its services performed . . Federal regulations require agencies receiving grant dollars to provide matching funds a requirement which Free2Be has complied with . . Any suggestion that the Free2Be grant is an expense of state dollars which could have been used for any other purpose is simply wrong and illustrates a lack of understanding of federal grant processes . . Compliance with federal regulations is required to ensure that Alabama continues to receive federal grant dollars . . Federal revenues deposited into the Fund also come from gifts donations and bequests by private parties as provided by an amendment to VOCA through the USA PATRIOT Act in two thousand and one that went into effect in two thousand and two . . Since two thousand and two hundreds of thousands of dollars have been deposited into the Fund through this provision . . In March of this year ADECA began planning an on site compliance monitoring visit to the Huntsville office of Free2Be . . During the desk review process that precedes routine monitoring it was discovered that the organization has an outstanding federal debt with the IRS for payroll taxes . . The agency was placed on high risk status on March twenty nine two thousand and eighteen and the agencys ability to draw grant funds was suspended . . According to Gov . . Ivey s office Free2Be was flagged in March after it was learned that it had outstanding federal debt with the IRS for payroll taxes . . The agency was placed on high risk status on March twenty nine two thousand and eighteen and the agency s ability to draw grant funds was suspended . . MAN The Office makes money available to the states so that they can develop programs in every community that can engage with and assist victims of crime . .

Says Dean Heller helped "craft a partisan repeal bill that also would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions."
1
Yesterday the Trump Administration filed a court brief arguing that the Affordable Care Acts rules guaranteeing coverage for people with pre existing conditions are unconstitutionalseeking to undo one of the laws most important provisions and go back to allowing big insurance companies to deny people health coverage based on their medical history . . Last year after Sen. Dean Heller broke his promise to protect Nevadans health care and caved to President Trump he wound up helping craft a partisan repeal bill that also would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre existing conditions . . Poll after poll this year shows that health care is the top issue for voters in two thousand and eighteen . . Sen . . Dean Heller is already on the record on this issue he sided with Republicans who want to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and remove coverage protections for pre existing conditions . . Access to affordable health care is a major concern for Nevada voters and Hellers disastrous record on health care is a litany of broken promises and self serving politics . . Sen. Heller will have to answer for this agenda to increase costs and strip access to health care for hardworking families by letting big insurance companies go back to denying Nevadans health coverage if they have a pre existing condition . . Vox The Trump administration believes Obamacares preexisting conditions protections are now unconstitutional . . This bill fundamentally transforms health care in the United States . . This past week we heard testimony from Democrat and Republican governors and Medicaid directors who believe that with increased flexibility and freedom from Washington DC regulations they can do a better job of providing coverage for the people of their state . . We agree said Dr. Cassidy . . Heller has already said that his re election and the battle for control of the U.S. Senate will determine whether Washington Republicans can move forward with repeal . . Rosen for Nevada spokesperson Molly Forgey released the following statement . . Insurers could once again deny people coverage based on their medical history undoing the laws most popular provisions . . The Trump administration argued in a court brief filed on Thursday that Obamacares protections for preexisting conditions should be ruled unconstitutional opening up another front in the White Houses crusade to roll back the laws core insurance reforms . . If the Trump administrations argument were to prevail insurers could once again be able to flat out deny Americans insurance based on their health status . . Obamacare continues to collapse and we have no choice but to address this problem head on Sen. Johnson said . . Returning more health care decisions to the states and ensuring equal treatment for states like Wisconsin that spend taxpayer dollars wisely will allow local leaders to tailor their health care system to the needs of its citizens while maintaining protections for those with high cost and pre existing conditions . . ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND MATERIAL AVAILABLE . . Senators Lindsey Graham R SC Bill Cassidy R LA Dean Heller R NV Ron Johnson R WI and former US Senator Rick Santorum R PA today unveiled legislation to reform health care . . The Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson GCHJ proposal repeals the structure and architecture of Obamacare and replaces it with a block grant given annually to states to help individuals pay for health care . . This proposal removes the decisions from Washington and gives states significant latitude over how the dollars are used to best take care of the unique health care needs of the patients in each state . . The proposed legislation would repeal the ACAs Medicaid expansion premium tax credits cost sharing reduction CSR payments individual and employer mandates and the Basic Health Program BHP . . Instead the bill would provide states with block grants to fund health insurance coverage in their state . . The bill would also change the financing structure for the traditional Medicaid population from an open ended approach to a fixed per capita cap or block grant approach . . The Graham Cassidy bill would significantly reduce funding to states over the long term particularly for states that have already expanded Medicaid said Caroline Pearson senior vice president at Avalere . . States would have broad flexibility to shape their markets but would have less funding to subsidize coverage for low and middle income individuals . . Avaleres analysis projects the impact of the bill compared to current law and details the expected cumulative changes in federal funding for each state through two thousand and twenty six two thousand and twenty seven and two thousand and thirty six . . Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson treats all Americans the same no matter where they live . . Instead of a Washington knows best approach like Obamacare our legislation empowers those closest to the health care needs of their communities to provide solutions said Graham . . Our bill takes money and power out of Washington and gives it back to patients and states . . Up until last month Nevadans living in fourteen of our seventeen counties were not going to be able to buy insurance on the exchange next year . . On top of that the most disadvantaged Nevadans are forced to pay a fine for a product that they can not afford said Heller . . The Graham Cassidy Heller Johnson plan is the most viable solution to achieving our health care reform goals by recognizing Obamacares failed one size fits all approach and returning power to the states . . I thank Senators Graham and Cassidy for their leadership and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting a plan that allows our governors and legislatures the flexibility to support programs that are currently working in our states and to explore new options to address coverage and cost . . States are given the option to waive age rating rules essential health benefits the prohibition on medical underwriting and the required medical loss ratio for plans and enrollees who receive some benefit from the states block grant funding . . While this analysis does not attempt to project which states will pursue a waiver nor which of the ACAs market rules states will attempt to waive previous Congressional Budget Office CBO analyses have projected the expected impacts of waivers . .

"Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank."

Maija Treija deputy director of Latvias finance ministry said it lost its licence due to money laundering . . Of the billions sent from Russia she said Obviously it was money either stolen or with criminal origin The fight against money laundering was a never ending story she told the Finnish broadcaster YLE . . The involvement of Moldovas banks in the scandal led to a political crisis that has seen five prime ministers come and go in the last two years . . This article is more than two years old . . The German bank that loaned dollar 300m 260m to Donald Trump played a prominent role in a money laundering scandal run by Russian criminals with ties to the Kremlin the Guardian can reveal . . Deutsche Bank is one of dozens of western financial institutions that processed at least dollar 20bn and possibly more in money of criminal origin from Russia . . Ties with Russia are a matter of acute sensitivity for Deutsche . . In February it emerged that Deutsche had secretly reviewed multiple loans made to President Trump by its private wealth division to see if there was a connection to Russia . . Trump owes Deutsche about dollar 300m . . This month Moldovas parliament said Russias FSB had abusively treated Moldovan officials arriving in the Russian Federation . . It linked their harassment to Moldovas Laundromat investigation and said some of the money had been used to try to bribe Moldovan MPs . . The FSB run by Vladimir Putin before he became prime minister and president had used part of the Laundromat money to further Russian state interests Moldovan officials said . DFS Directs Bank to Hire an Independent Monitor to Review and Report on Its Existing Compliance Programs Policies and Procedures . . Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo today announced that Deutsche Bank AG and its New York branch will pay a dollar four hundred and twenty five million fine and hire an independent monitor as part of a consent order entered into with the New York State Department of Financial Services DFS for violations of New York anti money laundering laws involving a mirror trading scheme among the banks Moscow London and New York offices that laundered dollar ten billion out of Russia . . DFSs investigation found that the bank missed numerous opportunities to detect investigate and stop the scheme due to extensive compliance failures allowing the scheme to continue for years . . In the past half century presidents have repeatedly been dying to take advantage of timely vacancies said Laura Kalman a historian at the University of California Santa Barbara . . But in subtle and not so subtle ways the White House waged a quiet campaign to ensure that Mr. Trump had a second opportunity in his administrations first eighteen months to fulfill one of his most important campaign promises to his conservative followers that he would change the complexion and direction of the Supreme Court . Trump Boasts of Rapport With Wall St. but the Feeling Is Not Quite Mutual The New York Times . . Its goal was to assure Justice Anthony M. Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he decide to step down at the end of the courts term . . WASHINGTON President Trump singled him out for praise even while attacking other members of the Supreme Court . . The White House nominated people close to him to important judicial posts . . There was no telling they said what would happen if Democrats gained control of the Senate after the November elections and had the power to block the presidents choice as his successor . . There were no direct efforts to pressure or lobby Justice Kennedy to announce his resignation on Wednesday and it was hardly the first time a president had done his best to create a court opening . . And members of the Trump family forged personal connections . . Their goal was to assure Justice Anthony M. Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the courts term this week as he was rumored to be considering . . Allies of the White House were more blunt warning the eighty one year old justice that time was of the essence . . In January the UK and US imposed record dollar 630m fines on Deutsche for its role in another money laundering scam run out of its Moscow office . . The bank failed to prevent dollar 10bn of Russian money being laundered in a complex mirror trades operation . . The wealthy Russians that used the scheme have not been identified . . Bartfeld said the money had arrived from Deutsche Bank New York before being sent on to the Bank of New York Mellon which paid the invoice . . Trasta the bank that first sent the money to Deutsche did not appear in any paperwork he added . . Bartfeld said the payment came via two highly reputable and respected global banks . . The true figure could be dollar 80bn detectives believe . . One senior figure involved in the inquiry said the money from Russia was obviously either stolen or with criminal origin . . Investigators are still trying to identify some of the wealthy and politically influential Russians behind the operation known as the Global Laundromat . . Germanys biggest bank fined over trades totalling dollar ten bln . . Trades moved cash out of Russia possibly to launder regulators . . Web of trades spanned globe Deutsche did not heed warnings . . Photograph Alamy . . RZBs director Alexander Grigoriev was arrested in Moscow in two thousand and fifteen a year after his bank was shut down for money laundering offences . . Sources told the OCCRP that Grigoriev had links to the FSB Russias main spy agency . .

US total oil supply is expected to average twelve point one million b d this year making it the worlds largest oil producer PIRA Energy Group an energy markets consulting firm in New York reported . . PIRA counts oil supply as all liquids including condensates . . Current shortages of specialized rigs and fracturing equipment are expected to be resolved and shale production is projected to account for almost seventy five percent of Argentina s total natural gas production by two thousand and forty . . Algeria s production of both oil and natural gas has declined over the past decade which prompted the government to begin revising investment laws that stipulate preferential treatment for national oil companies in favor of collaboration with international companies to develop shale resources . . Algeria has begun a pilot shale gas well project and developed a twenty year investment plan to produce shale gas commercially by two thousand and twenty . . In the past five years China has drilled more than six hundred shale gas wells and produced zero point five Bcf d of shale gas as of two thousand and fifteen . . Shale gas is projected to account for more than forty percent of the country s total natural gas production by two thousand and forty which would make China the second largest shale gas producer in the world after the United States . . Argentina s commercial shale gas production was just zero point zero seven Bcf d at the end of two thousand and fifteen but foreign investment in shale gas production is increasing . . The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulically fracturing has contributed to increases in crude oil and natural gas production in the United States which are both expected to reach record levels in two thousand and eighteen . . Although horizontal drilling has been used for nearly a century its use as a source of U.S. oil and natural gas production began growing in the early 2000s . . The process involves drilling a well vertically to a certain depth and then bending the path of the drilling until it extends horizontally . . PIRA statistics show the US overtook Russia to become the second largest supplier of oil in two thousand and twelve and the US was just behind Saudi Arabia . . Both the US and Saudi Arabia increased oil supply in two thousand and thirteen with the US reporting the fastest production growth . . The US position as the worlds largest oil supplier looks to be secure for many years PIRA told its clients during a seminar in New York october ten eleven . . Although growth rates of US shale liquids are expected to become smaller in the future PIRAs forecast sees the US increasing the lead over the next two largest countries until after two thousand and twenty and retaining the lead to at least through two thousand and thirty . . Because they are longer and the drilling process is more complex a horizontal well is generally more expensive to drill than a vertical well but it is expected to produce more crude oil and natural gas . . Horizontal drilling allows more of the wellbore to remain in contact with the producing formation increasing the amount of oil or natural gas that can be recovered . . Pipeline infrastructure in Argentina is adequate to support current levels of shale gas production but it will need to be expanded as production grows . . Source U.S. Energy Information Administration based on DrillingInfo Inc. and IHS Markit . . Hydraulic fracturing is a completion technique meaning it is performed after the oil or natural gas well has been drilled . . Like horizontal drilling this technique has been practiced for many years but it has only recently become a major part of U.S. production in combination with horizontal drilling . . Shale gas production in Canada is projected to continue increasing and to account for almost thirty percent of Canada s total natural gas production by two thousand and forty . . China has been among the first countries outside of North America to develop shale resources . . Algerian shale production is projected to account for one third of the country s total natural gas production by two thousand and forty . . Mexico is expected to gradually develop its shale resource basins after the recent opening of the upstream sector to foreign investors . . The largest component of this growth is natural gas production from shale resources which grows from forty two Bcf d in two thousand and fifteen to one hundred and sixty eight Bcf d by two thousand and forty . . Shale gas is expected to account for thirty percent of world natural gas production by the end of the forecast period . . Although currently only four countriesthe United States Canada China and Argentinahave commercial shale gas production technological improvements over the forecast period are expected to encourage development of shale resources in other countries primarily in Mexico and Algeria . . US total supply growth in two thousand and thirteen is seen at one million b d and about the same as last year s growth . . Its growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the worlds net demand growth over the past two years PIRA said . Shale gas production drives world natural gas production growth Today in Energy U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA . . Shale crude and condensate production for two thousand and thirteen is estimated at two point five million b d which would be slightly over one third of total US crude production and shale NGL at one point two million b d which would be almost half of total NGLs . .

"Nearly 7 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions — but Rick Scott and Florida Republicans wants to take away their health care coverage by ending the Affordable Care Act."
1
Discussion . . The Affordable Care Act guarantees access to health insurance in the individual market and ends other underwriting practices that left many people with pre existing conditions uninsured or with limited coverage before the law . . As discussions get underway to repeal and replace the ACA this analysis quantifies the number of adults who would be at risk of being denied if they were to seek coverage in the individual market under pre ACA rules . . In the wake of Congressional Republicans failure to drum up support for their health plan last month the White House is negotiating to put repeal of the Affordable Care Act or ACA back on the table . . While the previous proposal would have already driven up health care costs and stripped millions of coverage the new proposal is rumored to include provisions that would undo protections for the more than one hundred and thirty million Americans who have a pre existing health condition . . Republicans are now discussing a provision that is effectively a sick tax on premiums People with health conditions would be charged multiples more based on their medical history paying above standard rates for coverage . . Nationally the most common pre existing conditions were high blood pressure forty four million people behavioral health disorders forty five million people high cholesterol forty four million people asthma and chronic lung disease thirty four million people and osteoarthritis and other joint disorders thirty four million people . . While people with Medicaid or employer based plans would remain covered regardless of medical history the repeal of pre ex protections means that the millions with pre existing conditions would face higher rates if they ever needed individual market coverage . . The return of pre ex discrimination would hurt older Americans the most . . TALLAHASSEE Gov . . Rick Scott whose political career is largely defined by opposition to the Affordable Care Act still wants Republicans to repeal the federal health care law despite their apparent failure to do so . . Floridians simply can not afford the high taxes and mandates of Obamacare . . What protections might exist in these or other states under a repeal and replace scenario is unclear . . At any given time the vast majority of these approximately fifty two million people with declinable pre existing conditions have coverage through an employer or through public programs like Medicaid . . The individual market is where people seek health insurance during times in their lives when they lack eligibility for job based coverage or for public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . . Estimates of the Share of Adults with Pre Existing Conditions . . We estimate that twenty seven percent of adult Americans under the age of sixty five have health conditions that would likely leave them uninsurable if they applied for individual market coverage under pre ACA underwriting practices that existed in nearly all states . . While a large share of this group has coverage through an employer or public coverage where they do not face medical underwriting these estimates quantify how many people could be ineligible for individual market insurance under pre ACA practices if they were to ever lose this coverage . . The rates of declinable pre existing conditions vary from state to state . . On the low end in Colorado and Minnesota at least twenty two percent of non elderly adults have conditions that would likely be declinable if they were to seek coverage in the individual market under pre ACA underwriting practices . . Rates are higher in other states particularly in the South such as Tennessee thirty two percent Arkansas thirty two percent Alabama thirty three percent Kentucky thirty three percent Mississippi thirty four percent and West Virginia thirty six percent where at least a third of the non elderly population would have declinable conditions . . People with histories of serious conditions such as cancer or heart attacks were regularly denied coverage altogether . . About half of nonelderly Americans have one or more pre existing health conditions according to a recent brief by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or HHS that examined the prevalence of conditions that would have resulted in higher rates condition exclusions or coverage denials before the ACA . . Approximately one hundred and thirty million nonelderly people have pre existing conditions nationwide and as shown in the table available below there is an average of more than three hundred thousand per congressional district . . There is absolutely no question that Obamacare must be repealed immediately so Americans can actually afford to purchase health insurance Scott wrote . . Joshua Karp spokesman for American Bridge PAC a Democratic supporting political committee responded Whether it is Trumpcare or repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement Rick Scott is stuck with a cruel plan to take away health care from millions like gum stuck to a shoe . . Even so the failure of the Senate bill could help Scott politically . . The statement appears at odds with President Donald Trumps solution to let Obamacare fail in light of the Senate GOPs inability to pass its own health care bill dubbed the Better Care Reconciliation Act . . When insurers leave the health plan exchanges set up by the law Democrats will come to Republicans looking to help fix the law Trump told reporters Tuesday in Washington . . Scott first entered the national political scene as one of the staunchest critics of a bill that would later become Obamacare setting up Conservatives for Patients Rights a group dedicated to killing the bill . . Methodology . . To calculate the number of people with pre existing conditions by congressional district we obtained estimates of the nonelderly population from the two thousand and fifteen American Community Survey or ACS then subtracted out the number of nonelderly people who are covered by Medicare and would not be subject to possible discrimination based on a pre existing condition . . For the three states that recently redistrictedFlorida North Carolina and Virginiawe used ACS county estimates and a crosswalk provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation to approximate current district boundaries for the 115th Congress . .

Says Democratic North Carolina House candidate Dan McCready "took money from the Pelosi crowd" and is "with them" in their agenda and "wants to repeal your tax cut."

SAVE NOW . . it is unclear whether opposition to Pelosi will inoculate either Democrat from the kind of ads that ran in Pennsylvanias special election this month where Democrat Conor Lamb narrowly beat Republican U.S. Rep. Rick Saccone . . Lamb overcame TV ads that sought to tie him to Pelosi the former House speaker from San Francisco . . NC 9th House Democrats will not support Nancy Pelosi as leader Charlotte Observer . . Dan McCready and Christian Cano the two Democratic candidates for North Carolina s 9th Congressional District say they will not support Nancy Pelosi of California as US House leader . . they are running for Republican Robert Pittenger s seat . . On the one hand they might say they do not support her . . But on the other hand they will accept support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC where Nancy Pelosi is the leading fundraiser . . McCready criticized Pelosi in November in an Observer column where he took leaders of both parties to task over a Congressional fund that had paid out millions in private settlements many involving claims of sexual harassment . . Dan McCready Deborah Triplett . . Nancy Pelosi is going to continue to be a major drag on Democratic candidates said Jesse Hunt a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee . . Democratic candidates will be unable to distance herself from her . . And when Democrats had the chance to take the high ground in recent days after learning about the abuses of former U.S. Rep. John Conyers Nancy Pelosi used moves from the Bill Clinton era playbook initially defending Conyers instead of condemning sexual assault McCready wrote . . In an email Cano said it is time for Pelosi to be replaced . . Time and time again in this rotten era of American politics we have seen Republicans and Democrats violate the values they ran on while clutching onto political power . . On one side of the aisle many Republicans have danced around the deeply disturbing accusations against Donald Trump or more recently Roy Moore who is running for the Senate in Alabama . . And when Democrats had the chance to take the high ground in recent days after learning about the abuses of Congressman John Conyers Nancy Pelosi used moves from the Bill Clinton era playbook initially defending Conyers instead of condemning sexual assault . . The two Democrats running in North Carolinas 9th District say they do not support Nancy Pelosis re election as House leader . . AP Photo . . But it is been for the GOP he said . . And that is losing elections supporting political collusions in primaries supporting Corporate Democrats and Democrats In Name Only over real Democrats She has single handled caused us to lose thousands of local state and federal elections with her complete disconnect with our rich culturally diverse working class and struggling neighbors . . McCready has a big financial edge over all his opponents . . As they did in Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to tie Democratic congressional candidates to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco . . The two Democrats running in North Carolinas 9th District want to make that harder . . A solid HECK NO Democrat Christian Cano said in an email . . And Democrat Dan McCready said The fact is leaders of both parties have let us down . . it is time for a change he said . . Republicans jumped on Pelosis comments that recently enacted tax cuts are crumbs to middle America compared to the benefits to corporations and the wealthy . . According to an NBC Wall Street Journal poll last fall only twenty five percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Pelosi . . We need a full investigation and a public report that examines who has been accused and how much was paid in settlements . . Most importantly we deserve to find out what congressional leadership including Pelosi and Ryan knew and when . . Fortunately all across the country hundreds of men and women are running for office for the first time . . In two thousand and eighteen the DCCC will make more targeted and frequent additions to the Red to Blue program than in previous election cycles . . The House is in play in two thousand and eighteen and incredible Democratic challengers are stepping up to run across the largest offensive battlefield in a decade said DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Lujan . . These candidates have their own unique experiences rooted in these districts but what they all have in common are records of service to their communities and our country . . Today politicians in Washington are voting the party line and caving to the special interests . . I feel called to fight back for North Carolina families that Washington politicians are leaving behind . . I am running for Congress to work across the aisle to lower healthcare costs that are crushing the budgets of our families . . And that starts at the top . . Both Charlotte Democrats are running for the seat held by Republican Robert Pittenger . . The 9th District stretches from southeast Charlotte to Fayetteville . . Throughout two thousand and seventeen the DCCC has focused on allowing candidates to build strong relationships with voters and allies on the ground . . Toward that goal the Committee has provided support to all Democratic House candidates willing to have open lines of communication and work collaboratively with the Committee . . The following candidates are now Red to Blue Candidates . . AP . . They say Republicans and Democrats can not agree on anything . . But it seems we have found the one thing that career politicians can agree on protecting their political allies who use their power to prey on and harass others . . Lujan continued it is still early in the cycle but there is no question that these candidates are building strong campaigns energizing the grassroots and raising the resources necessary to win in tough districts . . Candidates are our best asset and that is why I am proud to announce the first round of our battle tested Red to Blue program . .

"Only Duterte’s Philippines and Trump’s United States of America have money bail."

Newsom You know let us talk about bail reform . . Only Duterte s Philippines and Trump s United States of America have money bail . . California became the first state to step up and step into this debate and do the right thing . . Nearly two thirds of inmates in California jails are being held awaiting trial . . California is at the forefront of a national campaign to end money bail that has also recently seen states like New Jersey and New Mexico adopt polices to circumvent the for profit bail industry though none had yet eliminated bail completely . . SB ten was approved by the Legislature last week after a nearly two year push with largely Democratic support . . Commercial Bail Bonding A Comparison of Common Law Alternatives F. E. Devine nine trillion seven hundred and eighty billion two hundred and seventy five million nine hundred and thirty seven thousand three hundred and twenty four Amazon.com Books . . The first comprehensive international comparison of bail this book examines how common law countries condemn or provide alternatives to the American commercial bail bonding system . . In his analysis of bail systems in fifteen countries F. E. Devine explains why other common law countries consider the commercial provision of bail an obstruction of justice and how they provide effective alternatives . . He believes in the elimination as he refers to it of chain migration which is nothing more than family reunification . . He parrots at almost every opportunity Donald Trump and Trumpism and Trump would have an advocate in Sacramento if he becomes the next governor . . As it relates to the issue of immigration here are the facts . . Shafer Fifteen seconds . . Newsom No I certainly think we represent the vast majority of Californians that reject John Cox s absolute allegiance to Trump and Trumpism and his longstanding advocacy for causes that I do not think the vast majority of Californians embrace . . Shafer All right . . The change which will take effect in October two thousand and nineteen goes further than any other state in the country to remove money from pretrial detention . . Today California reforms its bail system so that rich and poor alike are treated fairly Brown said in a statement . . Under Senate Bill ten California will replace bail with risk assessments of individuals and non monetary conditions of release . . Mr. Cox what is your vision . . Cox Well my vision of California s where people can afford to buy a house or pay rent that is affordable . . They can afford gasoline they can afford water electricity . . Margaret Dooley Sammuli a senior strategist with the ACLUs Campaign for Smart Justice said Californias approach was not an improvement on the old system and sent a signal to advocates across the country to move ahead cautiously . . The organization is involved with bail overhaul efforts in more than thirty other states . . Eliminating bail is as much about reducing the jail population and addressing racial disparities in criminal justice as it is about financial concerns Dooley Sammuli said . . CLICK TO SUBSCRIBE . . Advocates of abolishing bail contend that too many defendants remain stuck in custody because they can not afford to bail out effectively creating unequal justice based on wealth . . He also examines the systems of Ireland Malaysia Nigeria Pakistan Papua New Guinea Scotland Tanzania Zambia and Zimbabwe . . He details the prohibition of and statutory provisions against commercial bail in these common law countries and then highlights four alternative approaches to pre trial release recognizance criminal penalties non financial conditions and non commercial financial security deposits . . Devine argues that these options are as effective as commercial bail . . That this is the best deal California could figure out is a big concern . . David Quintana a lobbyist for the California Bail Agents Association said the industry is already mobilizing to block the new law from taking effect though he declined to discuss the specifics . . You do not eliminate an industry and expect those people to go down quietly he said . . I live in Los Banos California . . My question to both of the candidates is What will they do to resolve the issue of our sanctuary state or sanctuary city to deal with the illegal alien problems that we have . . Thank you . . We can not keep doing it to the people of the states . . Newsom So John Cox celebrator at least acknowledged enthusiastically that Donald Trump did the right thing when he pulled out of Paris . . I reject that and I applaud the leadership in the state of California particularly Governor Brown to radically change the way we produce and consume energy . . Accordingly they are more likely this time of year flu season to get an immunization shot and be healthier if they are not worried about the nurse turning them over . . I fear under a Cox administration working hand in glove with Donald Trump that our policies our progressive and enlightened policies on immigration will roll back into the dark ages . . Shafer Mr. Cox you once said I think that you would arrest CEOs that hired undocumented immigrants . . Again what you heard from John is an illusory strategy where he criticizes and identifies problems but with all due respect does not have the details and the strategies to actually solve any problems . . Cox What you heard from Gavin is more government more plans to pay out money from government tax credits plans for government financing . . But if you do not really attack the cost of building the delays in building the litigation the lawsuits the impact fees that are put on housing in the state . . Devine examines the pre trial release alternatives in detail arguing that they are at least as effective as commercial bail bonding . . Devine provides a complete comparative analysis of bail in Australia Canada England India New Zealand and South Africa . .

“Russia’s military budget has been decreasing, not increasing, year after year. You’d have thought NATO intelligence would have spotted that. Now compare Moscow’s military spending to NATO’s, which is almost a trillion dollars a year. It literally accounts for half the world’s military spending. I mean, there’s no competition here.”

As long as that pay arrives on time their housing needs are met and their work is the focus of national resources and attention servicemen should be satisfied with their lot . . So it is interesting that Putin still felt a military pay increase was needed in an election year . . But as some say campaign promises are made to be broken . . Economic factors certainly played a roleprimarily Russias recession and the drop in oil pricesbut perhaps more important were the geopolitical factors loss of access to certain defense articles imported from the West and the messy divorce from Ukraines defense sector . . Due to the war with Ukraine Russias defense industry could not buy components from its long time partner across the border this in turn delayed production and left the Russian Defense Ministry with less materiel to buy while the funds to pay for it sat in government coffers instead of getting spent . . Russias defense expenditures are not a coherent data set and have become easy to get lost in given the changes that have taken place . . Not that this is insignificant . . It will prevent Russia from meeting its official target to have modernised seventy percent of its forces by two thousand and twenty and it contrasts markedly with the trend in the USA where Donald Trump has committed himself to defence spending increases exceeding the total Russian budget . . Still too much . . Instead of the planned two point seven six eight trillion rubles the Russian budgets defense chapter has already been amended to two point nine five three a six point seven percent increase this higher two thousand and eighteen figure likely includes carryover payments for armament procurement in two thousand and seventeen . . Hence defense spending in two thousand and eighteen is unlikely to decline but the Russian leadership still intends to see military expenditure reduced as a share of GDP . . Planned spending on national defense was envisioned at two point eight one five trillion for two thousand and nineteen and two point eight zero seven trillion for 2020also hardly a steep cut and current performance suggests actual numbers will prove higher . . Now for the second time in as many years the miscalculation is proliferating across major media outlets . . The main source of the error is readily identifiable arcane though it may be In two thousand and sixteen the Russian government started paying off defense sector debt that had piled up over the years which created the illusion of much higher spending on national defense and accordingly a subsequent decline the following year . . Before this the Defense Ministry MoD had managed to rack up close to a trillion rubles in debt to defense contractors who had been producing equipment on credit borrowed from various banks . . Nonetheless it is especially frustrating to see the narrative of slashed military spending due to economic woes resurface now since the same miscalculation was made last year by Janes which reported a twenty five percent reduction in Russian defense spending from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and seventeen based on Moscows advance announcement of planned expenditures . . Janes later acknowledged the mistake and took down its original story but by that time the sensational figure had already been reported widely in the news media . . Orthodoxies about Moscows military ambitions suddenly seem to have been put into question when respected source of defence news HIS Janes ran the headline Russia announces deepest defence budget cuts since 1990s Based on analysis of returns from Russias Federal Treasury the assertion was that the defence budget was being cut by twenty five point five percent from three point eight trillion rubles dollar sixty five point four billion to two point eight trillion rubles dollar forty eight billion . . If true this would have been a massive deal one that could have eaten into not only Putins ambitious plans for military modernisation but also the countrys economic stability and even his own political standing . . Yet as we shall see the headline was profoundly misleading . . Official spending on defense dropped by about eight percent from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and seventeen from three point zero nine trillion rubles to two point eight four trillion and the defense budget was only scheduled for cuts averaging five six percent over the three year period of two thousand and seventeen two thousand and nineteen . . The numbers in this article reflect official defense spending not total military expenditure which might include funding for other militarized services like the border guards and Interior Ministry troops or military pensions which could add another trillion rubles to the bottom line . . Actual reductions in military spending began in two thousand and fifteen by about five percent . . The likely real cut is probably even less . . This is because in Russia even more so than in the West defence and security expenditure often appears under different budget lines and obscure headings . . Pre conscription physical and skills training is outsourced to schools through the revived GTO Ready for Labour and Defence programme . . In making its calculations SIPRI also converted the outsized budget figures from two thousand and sixteen into U.S. dollars which exacerbated the impression of a dramatic decline in defense spending in two thousand and seventeen . . Measuring Russias defense budget in dollars is analytically unhelpful since Russias defense sector does not buy much of anything in dollars . . Thus the resulting figures are distorted by changes in currency exchange rates and they are not adjusted for purchasing power parity . . Furthermore some defense enterprises were clever enough to collect interest on these large advances which sat in their accounts . . At the end of the year about two hundred and fifty three hundred billion rubles ended up trapped in this manner and the MoD had a hard choice to make either further finance incomplete orders and therefore reward delinquency or return the money to the government budget and potentially lose it . .

She described the daily persecution inflicted upon her fellow victims at the hands of the plantation owner class as including police discrimination the nagging worries that you are going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason . . I have learned that as long as I hold fast to my beliefs and values and follow my own moral compass then the only expectations I need to live up to are my own . . So graduates that is what I want for all of you . . I want you all to stay true to the most real most sincere most authentic parts of yourselves . . I want you to ask those basic questions Who do you want to be . . What inspires you . . How do you want to give back . . It can feel isolating . . It can make you feel like your life somehow does not matter that you are like the invisible man that Tuskegee grad Ralph Ellison wrote about all those years ago . . And as we have seen over the past few years those feelings are real . . Because heres the thing the road ahead is not going to be easy . . It never is especially for folks like you and me . . Because while we have come so far the truth is that those age old problems are stubborn and they have not fully gone away . . Applause . .

And heres what I really want you to know you have got everything you need to do this . . you have got it in you . . He kept fulfilling his double duty long after he hung up his uniform . . And graduates that is what we need from all of you . . I also have to recognize the Concert Choir . . Wow you guys are good . . Well done . . Hey no not just once in a while . . Not just when my husband or somebody you like is on the ballot . . But in every election at every level all of the time . . T U . . AUDIENCE You know . . MRS. OBAMA I love that . . We can take on those deep rooted problems and together together we can overcome anything that stands in our way . . And the first thing we have to do is vote . . Applause . . So there will be times just like for those Airmen when you feel like folks look right past you or they see just a fraction of who you really are . . The world will not always see you in those caps and gowns . . Maybe it feels like you are supposed to go to law school but what you really want to do is to teach little kids . . Maybe your parents are expecting you to come back home after you graduate but you are feeling a pull to travel the world . . I want you to listen to those thoughts . . But as potentially the first African American First Lady I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others . . Was I too loud or too angry or too emasculating . . Applause . . Look I love our daughters more than anything in the world more than life itself . . And while that may not be the first thing that some folks want to hear from an Ivy league educated lawyer it is truly who I am . . Applause . . Because even if you are nervous or unsure about what path to take in the years ahead I want you to realize that you have got everything you need right now to succeed . . you have got it . . we have both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores the people at formal events who assumed we were the help and those who have questioned our intelligence our honesty even our love of this country . . And I know that these little indignities are obviously nothing compared to what folks across the country are dealing with every single day those nagging worries that you are going to get stopped or pulled over for absolutely no reason the fear that your job application will be overlooked because of the way your name sounds the agony of sending your kids to schools that may no longer be separate but are far from equal the realization that no matter how far you rise in life how hard you work to be a good person a good parent a good citizen for some folks it will never be enough . .

These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death pending investigation It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths either reported or predicted could be due to incomplete data true decreases in the number of deaths or a combination of the two . . True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. can not be ascertained until final data become available . . Nationally overdose deaths involving prescription opioids and heroin remained stable from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and seventeen while deaths involving synthetic opioids increased . . A breakdown of the data shows West Virginia is similarly situated the heroin death rate remained stable and synthetic opioid deaths increased but prescription opioid deaths decreased . . Although West Virginia led the nation in two thousand and seventeen with seventeen point two prescription opioid involved deaths per one hundred thousand residents that number was actually a twelve point seven percent decrease from two thousand and sixteen when the rate was nineteen point seven deaths per one hundred thousand residents.The heroin involved death rate remained the same from two thousand and sixteen to two thousand and seventeen in West Virginia fourteen point nine deaths per one hundred thousand residents . . The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as pending investigation and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction year and month of death . . Specifically the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as pending investigation and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months . . Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors i.e twelve month ending period and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death pending investigation two . . Improvements in Data Quality . . In order for information on drug specific overdose deaths to be reported by jurisdiction in the NCHS Vital Statistics Rapid Release Monthly Provisional Drug Overdose Death dashboard states have been required to meet a set of timeliness and quality criteria consistently for each time point in the long term trend line shown starting with January two thousand and fifteen . . Improvements in timeliness and data quality over the last year have prompted a re evaluation of the length of time that data quality requirements have had to be met for states to be included in Figure two . . var informq informq informq.push embed . . A new report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC shows West Virginiahad the highest rate inthe nation in two thousand and seventeen for overdose deaths involving prescription opioids and synthetic opioids and is second only to Washington D.C. for heroin related overdose deaths . . For jurisdictions reporting fewer than one percent of records as pending investigation the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of two thousand and fifteen was approximately five percent lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period . . For jurisdictions reporting greater than one percent of records as pending investigation the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as thirty percent . . Thus jurisdictions are included in Figure two if one percent or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as pending investigation for the six most recent twelve month ending periods . . There may be slight differences between provisional and final data for a given data year e.g two thousand and seventeen . . Final drug overdose death data published annually through NCHS statistical reports eight and CDC WONDER are typically tabulated by state of residence and limited to residents of the United States . . Provisional data such as the Drug Overdose Death Counts released through the Vital Statistics Rapid Release VSRR program include all deaths that occurred within the fifty states and the District of Columbia including foreign residents . . More Emergency rooms open new paths for opioid overdose survivors . . More New CDC numbers Opioid overdose deaths by state . . Kolodny points to provisional data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . . All states in the nation are grappling with an opioid epidemic . . Using data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention comparing overdose deaths in two thousand and seventeen to two thousand and eighteen states and the District of Columbia are ranked by largest positive change between the two years . . The area with the largest decrease in opioid deaths ranked No . . Opioid overdose deaths appear to have leveled off two thousand and eighteen CDC data show . . Preliminary data from the CDC show slight declines in overdose deaths in the first few months of two thousand and eighteen . . Bill Kinkle has not worked as a nurse in nearly a decade . . But the absence of adequate easily accessible harm reduction treatment and recovery resources have driven the demand to more dangerous and deadly alternatives said Bates a member of the House Committee on Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse . . In the absence of these we face the grim prospect of the statistics on overdose deaths improving only when we run out of West Virginians to lose . .

"We’re talking about a law that would allow a child to be aborted right up to the moment of birth."

VTDigger is underwritten by . . we are talking about a law that would allow a child to be aborted right up to the moment of birth he said of a proposal under consideration by the House Human Services and Judiciary committees . . it is taking us to a place where we are literally killing babies . . But the bishop who is working with both a lay committee and law enforcement task force reviewing past misconduct by diocesan priests and orphanage personnel admits his appearance could spark questions . . If I was to go down to the Statehouse the first thing that someone would come out with is You have no rights to lecture us about moral law given what the church did to children . . So goes the challenge for Coyne and Vermont Catholics who are aiming to publicize their opposition to H.57 an act relating to preserving the right to abortion at the same time the diocese is facing continuing headlines about past abuse of altar boys and orphans under its charge . . H.57 goes far beyond Roe vs. Wade guaranteeing unrestricted abortion through all nine months of pregnancy and declaring the baby to have no individual rights . . This means that a baby in the womb can be terminated right up to the moment of natural birth . . My friends that is not abortion . . That is infanticide . . And this law would legislate that right to an abortion to infanticide not be denied restricted or infringed by any government entity This is not a Catholic issue but a social justice issue . . I plead with you . . Coyne told more than one hundred people at Rutlands Christ the King Church that a lay committee was reviewing the personnel files of fifty two former clergy with abuse allegations so it can publicize the names of offenders later this year . . I can not guarantee when the work will be done but we need to be open and transparent the bishop said . . we are trying to do everything we can to make sure it never happens again . . In response sponsors say their bill is not intended to change or preempt abortion law but simply codify current access But that is not stopping Coyne from outlining his opposition in a public statement the diocese is distributing online . . Our faith teaches that all human life is sacred meaning of God from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death and that we are called to embrace and protect that sacred gift the bishop writes in part . . So why did not the leader of the states largest religious denomination plan on joining a long line of people testifying at a Wednesday public hearing . . Coyne says he only learned about the session the day before and decided to submit a written statement rather than tear up his already full schedule for two minutes of microphone time . . Get all of VTDigger s daily news . . The bishop is asking Vermont Catholics to contact their state representatives and voice opposition to the bill . . Parishioners in turn are asking him about ways the church can as one meeting attendee said Tuesday lead the charge against this soulless pagan idea . . Could the diocese publicly excommunicate Catholic lawmakers who support the bill . . The bishop did not say no . . I am doing everything I can he concluded to educate and help people make good decisions . . Share Email ninety eight Shares . they will still deserve charity from us . . Could a pastor counsel privately that a legislator can not receive communion if they vote yes . . Because of variation that occurred among reporting areas in the percentage of abortions obtained by out of state residents from zero point three percent in Hawaii to forty nine percent in Kansas abortion rates and ratios calculated by maternal residence might provide a more accurate reflection of the state specific distribution of women obtaining abortions . . However because states vary in the level of detail they collect on maternal residence twelve point seven percent of abortions were reported to CDC with unknown information on maternal residence . . Maternal Age . . Do not let this happen . . Vermonts Catholic Church faces challenge in abortion debate VTDigger . . Bishop Christopher Coyne strongly opposes a new bill safeguarding rights but says past clergy abuse of children has undercut the states largest religious denominations ability to speak with moral authority . . Share Email ninety eight Shares . . Vermont Catholic Bishop Christopher Coyne wants the Legislature to know he strongly opposes a new bill seeking to safeguard abortion rights . . Women in the youngest fifteen years and oldest forty years age groups accounted for the smallest percentages of abortions zero point three percent and three point five percent respectively and had the lowest abortion rates zero point five and two point five abortions per one thousand women aged fifteen and forty years respectively . . Among the forty four reporting areas that provided data by maternal age every year during twenty million sixty two thousand and fifteen this pattern across age groups was stable with the majority of abortions and the highest abortion rates occurring among women aged two thousand and twenty nine years and the lowest percentages of abortions and abortion rates occurring among women in the youngest and oldest age groups Table four . . From two thousand and six to two thousand and fifteen abortion rates decreased among all age groups although the decreases for adolescents fifty eight percent and fifty four percent for adolescents aged fifteen and one thousand five hundred and nineteen years respectively were greater than the decreases for women in all older age groups with decreases for women aged twenty years ranging from four percent among women aged forty years to thirty three percent among women aged two thousand and twenty four years . . Because of this variability and the relatively limited number of legal induced abortion related deaths every year national legal abortion case fatality rates were calculated for consecutive five year periods during nineteen million seven hundred and thirty two thousand and seven and for a consecutive seven year period during twenty million eighty two thousand and fourteen . .

Although during the election campaign candidate Trump claimed that the wall would cost only dollar twelve billion a Department of Homeland Security DHS internal report in February put the cost at dollar twenty one point six billion but that may be a major underestimate . .

Our focus is on socio economic interventions in critical sectors that we believe will enhance the quality of life for all Kenyans in ways that are tangible and measurable . . Growth in emerging market and developing economies is projected to increase from four percent in 2015the lowest since the two hundred thousand eight hundred and nine financial crisisto four point three and four point seven percent in two thousand and sixteen and two thousand and seventeen respectively . . Growth in China is expected to slow to six point three percent in two thousand and sixteen and six percent in two thousand and seventeen primarily reflecting weaker investment growth as the economy continues to rebalance . . India and the rest of emerging Asia are generally projected to continue growing at a robust pace although with some countries facing strong headwinds from Chinas economic rebalancing and global manufacturing weakness . . The recent economic expansion has been boosted by a stable macroeconomic environment positive investor confidence and a resilient services sector . . Looking ahead medium term gross domestic product growth GDP is expected to rise to five point nine percent in two thousand and twenty and six percent in two thousand and twenty underpinned by private consumption a pick up in industrial activity and still strong performance in the services sector . . Inflation is expected to remain within the governments target range while the current account deficit is projected to remain manageable . . We see an accelerating cyclical upswing boosting Europe China Japan and the United States as well as emerging Asia . . The latest World Economic Outlook has therefore upgraded its global growth projections to three point six percent for this year and three point seven percent for nextin both cases zero point one percentage point above our previous forecasts and well above 2016s global growth rate of three point two percent which was the lowest since the global financial crisis . . For two thousand and seventeen most of our upgrade owes to brighter prospects for the advanced economies whereas for 2018s positive revision emerging market and developing economies play a relatively bigger role . . The global growth projection for two thousand and fourteen has been marked down by zero point three percent to three point four percent reflecting both the legacy of the weak first quarter particularly in the United States and a less optimistic outlook for several emerging markets . . With somewhat stronger growth expected in some advanced economies next year the global growth projection for two thousand and fifteen remains at four percent . .

The challenge lies in unlocking a higher productive capacity . . Developments in the second half of two thousand and sixteen . . Global output growth is estimated at about three percent at an annualized rate for the third quarter of 2016broadly unchanged relative to the first two quarters of the year . . This stable average growth rate however masks divergent developments in different country groups . . The projection for the United States is the one with the highest likelihood among a wide range of possible scenarios . . It assumes a fiscal stimulus that leads growth to rise to two point three percent in two thousand and seventeen and two point five percent in two thousand and eighteen a cumulative increase in GDP of percentage point relative to the October forecast . . Growth projections for two thousand and seventeen have also been revised upward for Germany Japan Spain and the United Kingdom mostly on account of a stronger than expected performance during the latter part of two thousand and sixteen . . Notably we expect sub Saharan Africa where growth in per capita incomes has on average stalled for the past two years to improve overall in two thousand and eighteen . . The current global acceleration is also notable because it is broad basedmore so than at any time since the start of this decade . . Global growth for two thousand and sixteen is now estimated at three point one percent in line with the October two thousand and sixteen forecast . . Economic activity in both advanced economies and EMDEs is forecast to accelerate in two hundred and one thousand seven hundred and eighteen with global growth projected to be three point four percent and three point six percent respectively again unchanged from the October forecasts . . Advanced economies are now projected to grow by one point nine percent in two thousand and seventeen and two percent in two thousand and eighteen zero point one and zero point two percentage points more than in the October forecast respectively . .

We have already paid them dollar one point two five billion for the F thirty five project . . If they do make such a wrong move we will take it to the international arbitration court because we will want them to pay us back the money we have spent so far he told the newspaper . . I believe my meeting with U.S. President Trump during the G20 summit will be important for eliminating the deadlock in our bilateral relations and strengthening our cooperation he said . . If India accepts such an offer it could lead to an interesting competition of S four hundred and F 35s both deployed in each suppliers regional client . . Such a scenario will be determined by Indias willingness to let go of its oldest defense partnerRussia . . Live Mint quoted an unidentified Indian diplomatic source as saying India has a longstanding defense relationship with Russia which India can not wish away . .
