LEMON Well since you mention that I mean how do you compete against you know dollar twenty seven million to Hillary Clinton Barack Obama dollar nineteen million . And would you be willing because John Edwards said he would be willing to take some money from other places in order to run his campaign . RICHARDSON No I think what Senator Edwards did going to public financing really disadvantages Democrats because you are not able to raise funds between the day you win the primaries and the time you are officially nominated . So I am going to continue raising money . it is painful but it is part of the process . That should be the lesson in this race will ph the huge amounts of money that are being raised . So revenues will come from economic growth . But spending cuts are essential in order to bring our budget into balance . CROWLEY Let me ask you a political question . And you have said that if there are Republican senators up for re election next year who vote for an increase in this debt ceiling without these things that you have outlined the Cut Cap and Balance you might go ahead and back a primary opponent to them that would . Are you talking about Senator Lugar Senator Snowe Senator Brown . Would you consider if they went ahead and said we have got to raise this debt ceiling you would consider running an opponent against them in a primary . DEMINT I have no plans to work against any incumbent Republicans . Do you see any kind of either of you any kind of a backlash coming . Because it looks like now we are going to have these Super PACs and the system is going to be totally overwhelmed by by big contributions . NEWT GINGRICH Well I think first of all they tend to be countervailing that is Senator Clinton Secretary Clinton can raise easily enough money to match Jeb Bush . So you you are going to see huge volumes on both sides and I think there is a declining value when you get above a certain number the the key for a candidate which I failed was to get above a critical mass if you know Romney could only have outspent me three to one I might have become the nominee but there is a point and sometime somewhere between five and twenty to one where you drown nobody who is a nominee in the general election is going to get outspent by a by a huge number because the country is too polarized on what kind of future it wants and both sides can generate huge amounts of money . BOB SCHIEFFER But why would people not become cynical when they say well his million billionaires he is got more billionaires than my candidate where does all this end . STEPHANIE CUTTER Well I do think they become cynical and I think what Newt is saying is that in the general both sides are going to be competitive but at a certain point all of this negativity and money thrown into the system begins to cancel each other out and people start tuning it out"

John McCain seems to be relishing a new role in the Senate one of President Donald Trump s leading trolls going where fellow Republican senators dare not go in public . Story highlights Sen. John McCain and Donald Trump have had a tense relationship for years . McCain questioned Trump s handling of US Australia relations and a recent raid in Yemen . Washington CNN John McCain seems to be relishing a new role in the Senate one of President Donald Trump s leading trolls going where fellow Republican senators dare not go in public . The Arizona senator has publicly criticized the President over his handling of US relations with Australia his Cabinet picks and his highly contentious travel and immigration ban and that is just this week . Following his re election last fall McCain is back to his maverick style . I am the one that said Ronald Reagan should not send Marines to Afghanistan I am the one that said Donald Rumsfeld should be fired I have said the general in Afghanistan should be fired McCain said Thursday when asked by CNN about his public opposition to Trump . McCain Feingold is a campaign finance measure widely reviled by conservatives McCain Kennedy is shorthand for the failed immigration reform effort in the Senate which would have offered ways illegal immigrants to become citizens provided they cleared certain hurdles and McCain Lieberman is a proposal that Mr. McCain has pushed for several years to limit carbon dioxide emissions with a cap and trade system . McCains campaign pushed back on the latter this morning pointing out that Mr. Romney had actually supported a regional cap and trade system in two thousand and five but then backed away from it . Just two years ago Mitt Romney fully supported a cap and trade system to deal with global climate change saying I am convinced it is good business and citing its positive effect on development of technologies and economic growth said Jill Hazelbaker a spokeswoman for Mr. McCain . Today desperate to attack John McCain in the heat of a political campaign Mitt Romney has changed his position once again . Mr. Romney initially supported a regional agreement on greenhouse gas emissions but later pulled Massachusetts out of the pact among northeastern states . But it was Mr. Romneys final coupling of Mr. McCain with a Democrat with Senator John F. Kerry that is potentially the most inflammatory among conservatives heading into Floridas Republican primary on Tuesday . It dates back to two thousand and four when Mr. Kerry as the Democratic presidential nominee reportedly considered asking Mr. McCain a fellow Vietnam veteran to be his running mate . In two thousand and five after a long tussle with the liberal legislature which overrode his initial veto Romney signed his signature health care law the predecessor to Obamacare which included a mandate requiring all hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims . His erstwhile primary opponent Rick Santorum attacked him for that decision . Santorum and Newt Gingrich both criticized Romney for the two thousand and two law during the GOP primary and called it another example of Romney lacking the conservative bona fides to carry his partys banner"
"3","""For every single illegal immigrant family in this country, it costs $20,000 â€” it costs us $20,000; $20,000 in infrastructural costs. They pay about $10,000 in taxes.""","1"," . Expectations that children of low skill immigrants will be able to generate fiscal surpluses taxes in excess of benefits that would compensate for the fiscal costs of their low skill parents are particularly problematic . To accomplish this it would be necessary for children in the second generation to pay very high taxes . Since the first generation of low skill immigrant families on average produce a net fiscal deficit of dollar nineteen thousand five hundred and eighty eight per year over a lifetime it would be necessary in the simplest sense for their children to generate a fiscal surplus of roughly the same amount each year to compensate for losses in the first generation . thirty one Since the average household in the U.S. receives over dollar twenty three thousand each year in immediate benefits and services it would probably be necessary for a household to pay over dollar forty thousand in taxes to generate a yearly fiscal surplus of dollar twenty thousand . Only very high income households would pay that much in taxes . The National Academy of Sciences NAS study of the fiscal impact of immigration found that the net taxes paid by the descendents of low skill immigrants did not make up for the severe initial fiscal losses in the first generation . Like the present study the NAS report showed the fiscal impact of immigrants without a high school degree was negative benefits received exceeded taxes paid . Thus low skill immigrant households received nearly three dollars in benefits and services for each dollar in taxes paid . Strikingly as Chart four shows low skill immigrant households in FY two thousand and four had average earnings of dollar twenty eight thousand eight hundred and ninety per household thus the average cost of government benefits and services received by these households not only exceeded the taxes paid by these households but actually exceeded the average earned income of these households . Net Annual Fiscal Deficit The net fiscal deficit of a household equals the cost of immediate benefits and services received minus taxes paid . As Chart five shows if the costs of direct and means tested benefits education and population based services were counted the average low skill household had a fiscal deficit of dollar nineteen thousand five hundred and eighty eight expenditures of dollar thirty thousand one hundred and sixty minus dollar ten thousand five hundred and seventy three in taxes . At dollar nineteen thousand five hundred and eighty eight the average annual fiscal deficit for low skill immigrant households was nearly twice the amount of taxes paid . In order for the average low skill household to be fiscally solvent taxes paid equaling immediate benefits received it would be necessary to eliminate all Social Security and Medicare all means tested welfare and to cut expenditures on public education roughly in half . Age Distribution of Benefits and Taxes among Low Skill Immigrants Charts six and seven separate the four point five million low skill immigrant households into six categories based on the age of the immigrant head of household . Low skill immigrant workers impose a net drain on government finance as soon as they enter the country and add significantly to those costs every year they remain"

"5","""The estate tax, which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others ... is there for a real simple reason: In America, we've never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth.""","1"," . DERRY NH Clinton answered questions from voters at a town hall at the opera house here which was her second stop on a two day swing through the state . The first question from the audience after Clinton s speech came from a woman who challenged her plan to pay for universal retirement accounts by freezing the estate tax at two thousand and nine levels . The woman said the money from inheritance had already been taxed when it was earned and she felt taxing it again was the wrong way to fund Clinton s plan . People disagree about this but the estate tax which came into being by Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and others and has been part of our tax system for a very long time is there for a real simple reason In America we have never liked the idea of massive inherited wealth Clinton replied . Part of the reason why America has always remained a meritocracy where you have to work for what you get where you have to get out there make your case to people come up with a good idea is that we never had a class of people sitting on generation after generation after generation of huge inherited wealth . Clinton said people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet were against doing away with the estate tax because they made it on their own . She went on to explain to applause that a married couple could have an estate worth up to dollar seven million before getting taxed and said she considered that a pretty healthy estate to leave to your children . He earns most of his income from businesses . He already exploits the tax system to the max . And he has benefitted enormously from the great asset price boom of the past twenty years . On Thursday afternoon he said the Republicans were giving the American people a big beautiful Christmas present For some reason he did not explain that the biggest presents by far would be handed out to people like him . Because Trump owns hundreds of unincorporated businesses he also stands to be a big beneficiary of the new flat rate on pass through income . In his two thousand and five tax return he declared dollar sixty seven point four million in income from rental real estate royalties partnerships S corporations trusts etc Since pass through income is currently taxed like salary income income of this sort would theoretically be subject to the thirty nine point six per cent top rate . In actual fact Trump offset much of this income by itemizing a huge unexplained loss that was probably carried over from the early nineteen nineties . But when those carryovers eventually run out as they probably have by now Trump will have a great deal of pass through income to pay tax on . Thanks to the Republican bill he would pay a rate of just twenty five per cent . Finally there is the abolition of the estate tax . To be sure Trump may have already taken precautions to avoid the estate tax by for example setting up specialized family trusts"

Beyond that the Vice President was expressing that he too is evolving on the issue after meeting so many committed couples and families in this country .

This is the first completed painting of four Revolutionary era scenes that the U.S. Congress commissioned from John Trumbull seventeen million five hundred and sixty one thousand eight hundred and forty three in one thousand eight hundred and seventeen . It is an enlarged version of a smaller painting approximately twenty one inches by thirty one inches that the artist had created as part of a series to document the events of the American revolution . When Trumbull was planning the smaller painting in one thousand seven hundred and eighty six he decided not to attempt a wholly accurate rendering of the scene rather he made his goal the preservation of the images of the Nations founders . He excluded those for whom no authoritative image could be found or created and he included delegates who were not in attendance at the time of the event . In all forty seven individuals forty two of the fifty six signers and five other patriots are depicted all painted from life or life portraits . Some of the rooms architectural features e.g the number and placement of doors and windows differ from historical fact having been based on an inaccurate sketch that Thomas Jefferson produced from memory in Paris . Trumbull also painted more elegant furniture covered the windows with heavy draperies rather than venetian blinds and decorated the rooms rear wall with captured British military flags believing that such trophies were probably displayed there . The Boston Globe reported Friday researchers Emily Sneff and Danielle Allen found the copy in a records office in southern England . The only other parchment copy is maintained by the National Archives in Washington . The two dated the document to the 1780s . They say it was found in the archives in Chichester and is believed to have originally belonged to a Duke of Richmond known as the Radical Duke for his support of Americans during the Revolutionary War . The researchers said the signers on the Sussex version are not broken down by state something that distinguishes it from the copy in the National Archives .

"12","Thompson ""voted against $250,000 caps on damages (and) almost anything that would make our legal system fairer.""","1"," . Even if it costs two cents why would not we want to eliminate those costs . asked Darren McKinney a spokesman for the American Tort Reform Association . In the grand scheme of things it is not the mother lode of costs but it is certainly not insignificant . Seeing the rising costs of medical malpractice in two thousand and two President George W. Bush took a cue from some states and proposed a nationwide cap of dollar two hundred and fifty thousand for non economic or pain and suffering damages in medical malpractices cases . Although the proposal was blocked by Senate Democrats it remains a popular solution Dozens of states currently have some sort of cap on non economic damages . In an editorial published last month in newspapers across the country Texas Gov . Rick Perry R described the effect of a cap in his state writing that ten new insurance carriers were lured to Texas and doctors insurance rates went down by an average of twenty seven percent . Critics point to a June New Yorker article that profiled the town of McAllen Texas where exorbitant health care costs reign despite tort reform caps . And some say the caps hurt people with legitimate claims leaving them to fend for themselves and costing the states . If you cap damages there will be people that fall through the cracks . Some people will have more than dollar one million or dollar two million worth of damages Shapiro said . They become wards of the public . it is like a balloon if you push in one direction it comes out somewhere else . So that is Medicare Medicaid and state welfare on the other side . The caps are like putting a tourniquet around a bleeding limb he said . It stops the bleeding but we really need an overhaul of the tort system . To that end a larger proposed solution is establishing medical courts or a specialized system modeled after bankruptcy and tax courts . Opponents including the AAJ say new courts would mean too much bureaucracy and money spent on an issue that does not merit it especially since few malpractice claims end up in court . But Philip K. Howard chairman of the nonprofit legal reform organization Common Good said a medical court system would help streamline malpractice suits . It would be designed for speed with judges making written rulings based on standard of care Howard said . It would build up written law and set standards . Changing the legal system will not accomplish these goals and only make it harder for those injured by medical negligence through no fault of their own to seek legal recourse . However the CBO estimate did not account for defensive spending which most proponents say eats up the real costs . In its two thousand and three report HHS estimated that between malpractice costs and defensive medicine reasonable tort reforms would save the federal government between dollar twenty eight point one billion and dollar fifty point six billion a year . Projected out over ten years that is far more than CBO estimated savings for replacing fee for service with bundled payments dollar eighteen point six billion setting up a health IT system dollar thirty four billion or a tax on the wealthy or insurance companies about dollar one hundred billion"

I would think that without having done the diplomatic spadework it would not really prove anything Albright said . The Obama campaign meanwhile circulated a memo by Obama spokesman Bill Burton saying Obamas response to the question had played well with focus groups and that Clinton had changed her position on the subject a claim her campaign denied . Anthony Lake an Obama foreign policy adviser who was national security adviser early in President Clintons administration defended Obamas statements . A great nation and its president should never fear negotiating with anyone and Senator Obama rightly said he would be willing to do so just as Richard Nixon did with China and Ronald Reagan with the Soviet Union Lake said . He said Obama was not trying to dictate the shape of specific negotiations and those would depend on how best to conduct them at the time . Rick Perry and Jeb Bush are the two candidates who right now are working very hard to set themselves up as the anti Trump for when the flirtation ends . The supporters of all the candidates would be wise if they really think the base needs to move on from Trump to present their candidates as voices of change who will change Washington not just attack Trump and his supporters . That only makes Trump stronger and his supporters more likely to bolt a GOP many of them already see as just another corrupt Washington institution .

Referring to female officials who were at the event she continued I know many of you and can attest as to how smart determined effective and dare I say likable you all are . Is Hillary Clinton the answer . By CNN s Jack Cafferty . The Hillary Clinton for president buzz is loud and getting louder . how is that not access . At Tuesday s White House press briefing the Trump administration trotted out Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price to defend the GOP s new health care bill . But less than a minute into his comments about the state of our health care system the new health secretary was already raising some eyebrows . Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care and we want to make sure we address that Price said . Medicaid is a system of government sponsored health care available to people with low incomes or who are disabled . The idea that has decreased the ability of folks to gain access to care is puzzling to say the least . Some progressives have accused Republicans of using the phrase access to care as a kind of public relations minded synonym for people who have to purchase health insurance on the private market because it is not provided by either the government or their employer . Republicans had only one woman Carly Fiorina in the party s seventeen person lineup . Green Party candidate Jill Stein was the only high profile female contender in the race besides Clinton . It seems highly likely that more women will join Gillibrand Gabbard and Warren before long . Sen. Kamala Harris D California has been going through the motions already she is released a book The Truths We Hold begun a tour to support it acknowledged that she is considering a run and made comments that seem to imply that she is really going to do it . Then there is Sen. Amy Klobuchar D Minnesota . In November the senator told ABC that she was still thinking about entering the race . Then she seemed to indicate that she is closer than ever to making a decision during a conversation with MSNBC on Tuesday .

And you know I think a winning strategy is not crafted by a political calculus that divides the country into red states and blue states . So what I have been trying to express in my campaign is that if you believe that part of the problem is the failed politics of Washington and the conventional thinking in Washington if you are tired of the backbiting and the score keeping and the special interest driven politics of Washington if you want somebody who can bring the country together around a common purpose and rally us around a common destiny then I am your guy . STEPHANOPOULOS But when you say that are you saying that Senator Clinton is part of the failed politics of Washington or not . OBAMA What I am suggesting is that we are going to need somebody who can break out of the political patterns that we have been in over the last twenty years . And part of that is the notion that half the country s on one side the other half s on the other . OBAMA You maybe have a few people in Iowa or a few people in Ohio and Florida who we are all battling over and afterwards we can not govern . And it is my belief that we need a fundamental change if we are going to dig ourselves out of the hole that George Bush has placed us in . And that is going to require the kind of aggressive diplomacy preparation yes but aggressive diplomacy the personal diplomacy of the next president to transform how the world sees us . That us ultimately going to make us safer . STEPHANOPOULOS Senator Clinton one of the areas that one of the things that Senator Obama just talked about is that he thinks that some of your differences are not as great as people have said . Your campaign criticized Senator Obama after he made a comment ruling out the use of nuclear weapons against Al Qaida yet here s what you said last year when asked about Bush administration reports that they might use tactical nuclear weapons in Iran . CLINTON No option should be off the table but I would certainly take nuclear weapons off the table . And this administration has been very willing to talk about using nuclear weapons in a way we have not seen since the dawn of the nuclear age . And led to the rise of Al Qaeda and to ISIS . Now in fact what we have got to do and I think there is widespread agreement here because the United States can not do it alone . What we need to do is lead an international coalition which includes very significantly the Muslim nations in that region who are gon na have to fight and defend their way of life .

Joe Biden comments on Hillary Clinton s two thousand and sixteen election bid Business Insider . Biden was among an all star roster of Democratic Party surrogates who backed Clinton s campaign in a brutal election against Donald Trump last year . Former Vice President Joe Biden mused about the potential for a future White House run and reflected on the two thousand and sixteen race during an appearance at the SALT conference in Las Vegas on Thursday . Speaking about Hillary Clinton s surprise November defeat to Donald Trump Biden said I never thought she was a great candidate . I thought I was a great candidate . It was an unexpected admission from Biden whose party brought out an all star roster to rally support for Clinton in the final days of a brutal campaign last year . Clinton s bid for the White House has been criticized for its heavy focus on casting Trump as unfit for office rather than making strong arguments for her candidacy . Stating that Trump has presided over a historic increase in hate crimes and biased incidents targeting people of color immigrants LGBTQ Americans and people of Jewish faith Biden said that at the end of Trumps first year in office anti Semitic incidents increased nearly sixty percent the largest one year increase since the Anti Defamation League started keeping records forty years ago . He also condemned the president for cutting funding for anti extremism programs intended to counter the far right . Hate did not begin with Donald Trump and it will not end with him . But this is a defining moment in our nations history Biden said asserting that Americans are now in a battle for the soul of this nation . Trump has been a polarizing president for Jewish Americans earning praise in some corners for actions on Israel including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and backing Israels sovereignty over the Golan Heights . Most recently he generated intense debate between his supporters and detractors within the American Jewish community when he issued an executive order on anti Semitism that he said would help combat hatred on college campuses . At the same time his brash commentary directed at Jews in various speeches and interviews stylistically carried over from his days as a real estate mogul and reality TV star has led some to say that he traffics in anti Semitic tropes . President Donald Trump acknowledged the political division that has roiled the US in the early years of his presidency and said he wants to do something about it . During a meeting with network news anchors on Tuesday Trump said I want to see our country united . I want to bring our country back from a tremendous divisiveness . He insisted that the rift developed not just over one year over many years including the Bush years not just Obama . Trump bragged that it was much worse during Bill Clinton s one thousand nine hundred and ninety eight impeachment according to an on the record excerpt of his remarks . So many of you are too young to remember that . I feel too young to remember it but I guess I am not the president quipped"
