""The campaign, including the advertising, is in a holding pattern for now because Leader McConnell's office has reached out and wants to have discussions about how best to proceed in the coming months in order to avoid the kind of judicial confirmations bottleneck that the groups are concerned about,"" a Judicial Crisis Network spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider.

Government-controlled health care No, this legislation is not as significant as Medicare, which enabled the elderly and disabled to receive real protection when they were less capable of obtaining coverage and had no alternatives whatsoever. But this legislation has the potential to change the current social services fabric because the health insurance transformation that will pass will be the beginning of a government-controlled health care system.-- Tommy Thompson in NY Times.

Thus, as a practical matter, a state can, for instance, require that group health plans sold by commercial insurers include coverage for particular benefits, but a state cannot require an employer to purchase that coverage, nor can a state even require an employer to provide health insurance to its workers. [6] Because of these distinctions, Congress established two sets of federal health insurance rules under HIPAA: one for employer-group coverage, and one for the individual market. HIPAA Group Health Insurance Rules Under HIPPA, Congress set basic rules for employer-group health insurance in four key areas.; Relevance: 0.8468009829521179; Entailment: None[9] The components of the reform legislation should follow two basic principles: Principle #1: No discrimination against those who buy their own coverage. As noted, the biggest flaw in the current rules governing individual health insurance is that they do not appropriately credit consumers who voluntarily purchase health insurance coverage before they need it and continue paying premiums while they are healthy. Unlike in the employer-group market, a person who purchased individual health insurance for years and then needs or wants new coverage can still be denied coverage for a medical condition that he developed while covered by his previous policy, or charged a higher premium than similarly situated individuals, or refused new coverage entirely. The solution is to establish rules for the individual market that permit someone who has purchased and maintained coverage to obtain, in certain circumstances, new individual health insurance coverage at standard rates, regardless of the individual’s health status or past medical history.; Relevance: 0.8387487530708313; Entailment: NoneGiven past success in covering uninsured individuals with expensive medical conditions through state high-risk pools, the remaining uninsured likely have less costly medical conditions. If Congress is concerned with covering that remaining population sooner, one option might be an initial, one-time open season during which applicants could obtain individual health insurance without pre-existing-condition exclusions, regardless of the applicants’ prior coverage histories, so that everyone would have an equal opportunity to start earning creditable coverage under the new rules. The Benefits This kind of balanced and reasonable approach to setting coverage rules for individual health insurance offers a number of advantages. First, this approach remedies one of the two main disparities in current federal law that bias the present system toward employer-sponsored coverage, and consequently inhibit the growth of a more consumer-driven health system.; Relevance: 0.8281424641609192; Entailment: NoneUnlike the rules for group coverage, HIPAA does not require individual market insurers to credit applicants with prior coverage. Thus, in the individual health insurance market, people who buy health insurance before they need it are treated the same as those who wait until they need medical care before buying insurance. Aside from being inequitable, such rules are contrary to the public policy goal of encouraging people to buy health insurance before they need to use it. This flaw in HIPAA also left an opening for supporters of more government intervention to push for a blanket prohibition on the use of pre-existing-condition exclusions, which Congress then included in the Obamacare legislation.; Relevance: 0.8218024373054504; Entailment: None1) Guaranteed Issue of Coverage. HIPAA requires group health insurance to be “guaranteed issue” by health insurers for small employers (defined as two to 50 employees) and by any employer plan (regardless of size) for individuals eligible for coverage under the terms of the plan. This means that if a small employer seeks to purchase group coverage for its workers from a commercial insurer, the insurer may not refuse to sell the employer such coverage if the employer otherwise qualifies. Similarly, if an employer offers health insurance to his workers, through either a policy purchased from an insurer or through a self-insured plan, the employer (and, when applicable, the insurer) may not refuse to cover a worker, or the dependent of a worker, who is otherwise eligible for coverage under the terms of the employer’s plan.; Relevance: 0.8216037750244141; Entailment: None=== NEW Article: 0.04581471224312206 ===Sanders recently attacked Warren’s payment plan, describing his own as “far more, I think, progressive, because it will not impact employers of low-wage workers but hit significantly employers of upper-income people.” Pete Buttigieg In a riff on Sanders’ proposal, the South Bend mayor has proposed a so-called “Medicare For All Who Want It” plan. In other words, the government would provide a low-cost health care option that people could buy into if they are not satisfied with their employer-provided insurance — but they would not have to opt in. “Everyone should have the option of getting coverage through a public insurance alternative,” Buttigieg’s campaign said in a statement. “This way, if a private insurance plan from your employer or the marketplace is not affordable, you can get a plan that is.” Buttigieg’s plan is more of an expansion on the Affordable Care Act than it is a truly universal plan — people could still choose not to pay for health care if they can not afford it.; Relevance: 0.8548586964607239; Entailment: NoneIt does not cost $30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year.” Kamala Harris Attempting to thread the needle between Biden and Sanders, Harris released her own more moderate take on Medicare-for-All earlier this year. Her version of the plan would not eliminate private insurance; instead, it would require that all private plans abide by a set of requirements comparable to Medicare. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around,” Harris wrote. Her plan would take far longer than the Sanders plan to implement: Where the Vermont senator proposed a transition period of four years, Harris has offered a period of 10 years in which Americans could buy into a government option.; Relevance: 0.8424882292747498; Entailment: NoneSanders’s plan would prevent employers from providing health care plans that compete with the government’s option, and it establishes a four-year timetable for Americans to switch over to the new universal Medicare.

Under President Sanders, all Americans would be able to access a universal health care plan that would cover a wide array of services, including hospital visits, vision and dental benefits, maternity care, lab services, medical devices, and more; the only out-of-pocket spending would be on prescription drugs.

In a video announcing his health care plan, though, Biden argued that “adding a public option to Obamacare is the best way to lower costs and cover everyone.” He has explicitly rejected Medicare-for-All, describing it as an Obamacare repeal that undoes the progress he helped Obama make when the ACA was passed.
