"0","""Productivity has risen 18 percent ...yet wages have stayed flat... There are 5-million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in 2000.""","2"," . As we have seen with the home foreclosure crisis too many American families are not sharing in the growth that is created and driven from this city . Now productivity has risen eighteen percent among American workers over the past six years yet wages have stayed flat and family incomes have fallen by nearly dollar one thousand . There are five million more people in poverty here in our country than there were in two thousand . Across the country hardworking Americans are struggling to make ends meet . Productivity has gone up but wages have flat lined . And those at the top keep stacking the deck more and more in their favor . Yet since the late 1960s lawmakers have let the value of the minimum wage erode allowing inflation to gradually reduce the buying power of a minimum wage income . When the minimum wage has been raised the increases have been too small to counter the decline in value that has occurred since one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight when the minimum wage hit its peak in inflation adjusted terms . In two thousand and eighteen the federal minimum wage of dollar seven point two five was worth fourteen point eight percent less than when it was last raised in two thousand and nine after adjusting for inflation and twenty eight point six percent below its peak value in one thousand nine hundred and sixty eight when the minimum wage was the equivalent of dollar ten point one five in two thousand and eighteen dollars . Over the past six years worker productivity that means how hard you are working how much you put out per hour of your work . Productivity has risen eighteen percent American workers are the hardest working people in the world . And yet just look around wages have stayed flat . But at the end of the day what you have right now are millions of Americans working two or three jobs because the wages that they are earning are just too low . Real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years . So I believe that in fact this country needs to move toward a living wage . Job gains were led by increases in employment in the private service providing sector which added one hundred and fifty seven thousand employees as they have been since the start of the recovery . In contrast job gains for employers in goods producing sectors including manufacturing and construction have remained low and government employment which has fallen considerably since the onset of the Great Recession has continued to trend down over the last three months . The broadest measure of employmentthe employment to population ratioremained at fifty eight point seven percent slightly above its level a year ago but within the range that has prevailed over the last three years . Consequently the growth of CEO and executive compensation overall was a major factor driving the doubling of the income shares of the top one percent and top zero point one percent of U.S. households from one thousand nine hundred and seventy nine to two thousand and seven Bivens and Mishel two thousand and thirteen Bakija Cole and Heim two thousand and twelve"

As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. s birthday I wonder what MLK would think about the country for which he dedicated his life to fighting ... . If he were alive today MLK would be taken aback by what has just transpired in this country . Quotes That ll Empower Inspire You . When I hear the name Martin Luther King Jr. the first thought that immediately comes to mind is his I Have A Dream speech . Growing up learning this speech and everything it stood for was a staple in my school s curriculum . However the quote did not come from a letter as long believed . Martin Luther King Jr. whose life and dream we celebrate today was a great leader for civil rights . Unlike todays Civil Rights leaders who seek divisiveness and handouts Dr. King dream was a post racial society where people were judged by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin . However the quote did not come from a letter as long believed . Martin Luther King Jr. whose life and dream we celebrate today was a great leader for civil rights . Unlike today s Civil Rights leaders who seek divisiveness and handouts Dr. King dream was a post racial society where people were judged by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin . Thousands took to the Lincoln Memorial to fight for jobs freedom and equality for African Americans . That was the day MLK Jr. shared his iconic I Have A Dream speech spelling out his vision for what our country could be if love trumped hate education overcame fear and hard work and appreciation produced peace . In MLK Jr. s memory you can donate to a civil rights group like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP take some time to read up on history and pick up a copy of MLK Jr. s autobiography or take a day trip and visit a museum like the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC . Everyone in this country knows something about and respects Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. Well almost everyone respects him . King Jr. is one of only four men along with Lincoln Washington and Columbus who have a national holiday in their honor . The March for Our Lives was not Yolanda Renee King s first public speaking gig . She also led a chant in honor of her grandfather at his Washington D.C. memorial earlier this year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day . This is likely just the start of a long life of activism for the nine year old . But as many pointed out Trump s tweet about Martin Luther King Jr. is at odds with his own record as a landlord in New York City a candidate for office and now president . Today we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the 50th anniversary of his assassination Trump tweeted . Earlier this year I spoke about Dr. Kings legacy of justice and peace and his impact on uniting Americans"

Now we know why thanks to a hilarious juxtaposition of links over at Drudge Report . Just as forty seven percent of Americans will not pay federal income taxes forty five percent of Americans think the current amount of federal income tax they pay is just About right . Looking at the breakdown by income group one has to wonder ... how do forty four percent of Americans making less than dollar twenty thousand a year feel that federal income taxes are too high . The withholding tax allowances determine how much federal tax is held back from each paycheck . In a two thousand and fourteen poll nearly fifty percent of Americans believed that middle income people pay too much in federal taxes source Gallup . Though you do not have complete control over the amount you pay you do have some say in how much tax is taken from your paycheck from week to week . Your cost of living notwithstanding you are in the top sixth of earners . Top one percent pay nearly half of federal income taxes . The top earning one percent of Americans will pay nearly half of federal income taxes for two thousand and fourteen the largest share in at least three years a study says . Scott Hodge president of the business backed Tax Foundation released a report based on two thousand and nine IRS tax data that found ninety seven percent of American tax filers paid a lower rate of income tax than Romney did . The bottom forty percent of tax filers pay no income tax at all or receive a refund Hodge told us in a phone interview and so by definition those people are paying less than Mitt Romney On average Hodge said people making between dollar one hundred thousand and dollar two hundred thousand paid about twelve percent in federal income taxes . that is less than Romneys thirteen point nine percent and people making less than dollar two hundred thousand represent more than ninety seven percent of all tax filers .

Again this is an area where I think the United States needs to be just focused like the proverbial laser . When I was in Pakistan and Afghanistan in January I met with both President Karzai and President Musharraf . CLINTON And I asked them if it would help to have a high level presidential envoy working with both of them to try to figure out how we can move toward what are American interests and how we can keep Pakistan from undermining the war against the Taliban and Al Qaida . he is recently placed opposition leader Benazir Bhutto under house arrest twice now and imprisoned numerous other dissenters . And I know you spoke with Musharraf last week . And you along with several others on the stage assert that the U.S. should maintain its current level of financial support for Pakistan . President Bush initially did not attack the tribal areas because he was afraid that if he did the government of Pervez Musharraf would fall . When Bush began to tire of Musharraf and to tilt away from him and then started a program of air strikes and incursions into Pakistan it coincided with a period of rising instability there . In the name of encouraging genuine political competition in Pakistan the Bush Administration prodded Musharraf to allow Benazir Bhutto to return and begin a political campaign . Huckabee and Obama only on MEET THE PRESS . MR. RUSSERT But if in fact you went into Pakistan in order to take out al Qaeda could not you very well destabilize the Musharraf regime and help the Taliban take over Pakistan . HUCKABEE Oh I I do not think it would be an effort to destabilize the Musharraf government . McCain prides himself on his knowledge of Pakistan .

Obama says he is going to drop bombs on Pakistan Stephen Biegun another of McCains inner circle of foreign policy advisers told me . Dictators set the country right whereas civilian governments brought it to ruins he said adding military rule always brought progress to Pakistan .The former President added that whenever martial law was declared in Pakistan it was the need of the hour . All Asian countries have seen progress because of dictators he said adding that it makes no difference to the population of Pakistan whether the country is being governed by an elected government or by an autocrat as long as there is progress and prosperity.Mr Musharraf also criticised former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif s India policy saying it was a total sell out policy .Commenting on the rule of Gen. Zia ul Haq Mr Musharraf said that the former dictator s decision to help America and the Mujahideen against the Soviet Union at the time of the Afghanistan invasion was a correct move.Mr Musharraf also spoke about his one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine coup d etat in which he seized power from the democratically elected government of then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif"

He has blessed the Republican Party with some very good candidates . The Democrats can not even find one . During his run of the presidency in the two thousand and twelve election cycle Gingrich outlined an immigration plan that involved legalization for the undocumented immigrants already here though not citizenship . As our executive director Frank Sharry has said about him Gingrich while hardly a reformer in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush at least deigns to acknowledge the reality that it is neither practical nor humane to drive eleven million people out of the country And as Gingrichs opponent in the two thousand and twelve GOP primaries Michele Bachmann once sniped He probably has the most liberal position on illegal immigration of any of the candidates then in the race Gingrichs immigration plan is the red card proposal that would give immigrants already here some form of legal status . As Mary Giovagnoli director of the Immigration Policy Center once criticized It virtually guarantees that we create second class status for workers and their families lawful but with no real rights Unlike real immigration reform Gingrichs plan would do nothing to reform the legal immigration system .

"7","""We reduced abortion. We increased adoptions by 135 percent.""","1"," . As citizens politicians and advocates discuss the future of abortion access many predict that women will turn to remotely supervised medication induced abortions if the landmark decision is reversed . So what is telemedication abortion . While it is not exactly common in the U.S. right now it could be one of the ways women from all over the country access safe and affordable abortion services even if it is made illegal in some areas . I think we would all agree that if a woman has made her mind up to have an abortion she should be able to access it as early as possible in pregnancy when it is simpler lower risk of complication and less expensive for her Grossman says . Of course telemedication abortion will not be a legal option in states that would outlaw abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned . While I do not have a lot of concerns as a physician about the medical risks for self managed abortions I do have the concerns for legal risks today and with Roes standing Grossman says . And I have had the opportunity of serving as a governor and finding that while the courts were making decisions that affected abortion it is really upon the legislature and the governor to have an impact as well . Romney And so you can fight for instance to make sure that partial birth abortion is made illegal . You can fight to have information given to women who are thinking about having an abortion . But unlike in the past they will have medically safe options for obtaining the abortions a number of them will seek regardless . Medication abortion is effective and the advent of both medication abortion and telemedication abortion is giving people who need abortions an alternative to taking matters in their own hands . When women have access to effective medications and the necessary information to use them correctly self managed abortions are usually successful and free of medical complications . But ultimately since it is an issue of conscience I would respect a woman s right to make a different choice . I support the ban on partial birth abortion . I support the Hyde amendment . It is true that Romney vetoed several bills that violated the anti abortion position including one that would have provided funding for embryonic stem cell research and another that would have made the morning after pill available without a prescription . As we have pointed out before the Legislature overrode those vetoes but Romney did indeed adopt a number of anti abortion positions as governor . He neglects to mention however that in October two thousand and five he signed a bill seeking greater access to family planning services for low income individuals access that would have included availability of that same morning after pill . However while most of the new laws were enacted in states in the Midwest and the South abortion incidence declined in all regions and the number of clinics fell only in the Northeast and the West . Finally a number of states that did not enact any new abortion restrictions and that are generally supportive of abortion rightsfor example by allowing state Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for eligible womenexperienced declines in their abortion rates comparable to and sometimes greater than the national decline e.g California New Jersey and New York"

And by that I mean look if somebody says hey you know you did not do or she did not do a good job answering this or you know I do not think that that you know adds up whatever they might say I will take that seriously . But I really try not to take it personally and I think that is a big distinction that you have to begin to draw when you are in the public arena . I would announce an energy revolution because I think this is one of the most urgent domestic and national security priorities to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . And then what I would do is I would simply say to the American people as your president I am going to follow the Constitution of the United States . And that means the bringing back habeas corpus not using torture as a tool in our foreign policy rejoining the Geneva Conventions . WASHBURN Senator Clinton you wanted in on that . CLINTON I do because I have worked on behalf of education reform for a very long time and I know that the president has a certain bully pulpit that can be used on behalf of education to do exactly what Chris and Barack and others have said .

All told Obama has granted one thousand one hundred and seventy six commutations and one hundred and forty eight pardons fewer pardons than some presidents but more commutations than any other the White House said .

In two thousand and sixteen a soldier from the battalion was sentenced to twenty one days in military prison for taking part in what was called the hate wedding in which extremists celebrated the murder of a Palestinian toddler several months earlier . Soldiers from the battalion have also been convicted in the past of torturing and abusing Palestinian prisoners . He was hospitalized for three days after the beating according to the indictment . The lieutenant who was indicted last week is not suspected of having beaten the prisoners but of having failed to stop the soldiers from doing so . He was charged with failing to prevent a crime negligent assault and conduct unbecoming an officer the army said .

"13","In the Illinois Legislature, Barack Obama ""voted 'present,' instead of yes or no"" on seven votes involving abortion rights.","2"," . And stand there and do whatever is necessary for their country . Chicago Tribune Sen. Obamas explanation for present votes is questionable few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy as Sen. Obama did . Sen. Obama said he worked out an arrangement with abortion rights advocates to encourage Democrats to vote present on some bills if they feared a no would look insensitive and endanger their re election . Illinois Now on Obama s Present Votes On Choice . During Sen. Obamas two thousand and four Senate campaign the Illinois NOW PAC did not recommend the endorsement of Obama for U.S. Senate because he refused to stand up for a womans right to choose and repeatedly voted present on important legislation . As a State Senator Barack Obama voted present on seven abortion bills including a ban on partial birth abortion two parental notification laws and three born alive bills . Two of those votes were on measures to protect families from gun violenceone of which was a measure about firing guns on or near school grounds . As a state senator Sen.

During his eight year career in the Illinois state senate Barack Obama avoided making controversial votes approximately one hundred and thirty times which according to other Illinois state senators is much higher than average . Rather than vote yea or nay on the legislation in question Obama on those occasions simply voted present . In the Illinois state senate this was the equivalent of a nay vote when tallying up support or opposition to a given bill . Despite pleas from Americans for Republican Electoral College members to go against their party and not vote for President elect Donald Trump it did not make a difference . In fact not a single faithless elector voted for Hillary Clinton . Despite pleas from Americans for Republican Electoral College members to go against their party and not vote for President elect Donald Trump it did not make a difference . In fact not a single faithless elector voted for Hillary Clinton . In the end it was actually the Democrats who were the ones to break from their party s choice and voted against Clinton . But few of the other Democrats who voted present on abortion bills recall such a strategy . And like Obama they were not politically vulnerable . But the Obama campaign failed to address the fact that Sen. Obama voted present one hundred and twenty nine times on a wide array of issues including choice privacy for victims of sexual assault and school violence"

"15","The Mormon religion has ""a plan that will see the Constitution thrown out and replaced by a theocracy.""","0"," . Some of the same people tell us that America will never be a socialist country . I say America will never be a theocracy We are protected by the Constitution . It is time for the current sworn members of the Congress to honor their pledge to protect the Constitution regardless of their own political or religious beliefs . But we can not force them into faith by changing their behavior . On his campaign website Trump promised If I am elected president and Congress passes the First Amendment Defense Act I will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of Catholics and the beliefs of Americans of all faiths . I am horrified by what that implies . it is hypocrisy at its finest . So much right wing fear mongering hinges on the myth that Muslims in the U.S. will somehow impose religious beliefs on non Muslims ... so should not Christians also be against creating our own theocracy . America is a secular nation . And as a Christian I think that is profoundly offensive . The fact that Trump s temporary travel restriction specifically singled out travelers from majority Muslim countries already felt to many like a sure sign that this administration is not devoted to true religious freedom for Americans so does the fact that the Trump White House at one point supposedly worked on an immigration plan that prioritizes Christians suffering from religious persecution according to NPR . that is not protecting religious freedom it is protecting Christian freedom . I believe in making the best of our time on Earth in this country . And I believe in the fact that America is not a Christian nation This is no theocracy which means Christians have no right to impose their beliefs on others . there is a difference between spreading the Gospel and forcing it down peoples throats . I believe that members of the clergy and others whose career is religion should be given certain exemptions . And I am not in the minority a two thousand and fifteen Pew Research article by David Masci noted Virtually everyone agrees that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution offers some protections for religious groups . For example most even among gay rights advocates believe the Constitution protects clergy from being required to officiate at marriages for same sex couples and churches from being forced to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry in their sanctuaries . it is a nation founded on freedom and freedom of religion is important to that . These proposed religious freedom orders do little to defend freedom of religion rather it uses that idea as a shield for discrimination fear mongering and rejecting the notion of equality by placing Christians above others . But there is nothing Christian about that belief . What does religion have to do with racism or guns . The words God and Bible do not appear in the Constitution so it is a fallacy to say that we were born a Christian nation . Most but not all of our Founding Fathers were spiritual men with religious beliefs but they were clear on leaving religion out of government"

CNN A leading Republican senator said Sunday he is willing to break the no tax pledge promoted by activist Grover Norquist if Democrats are willing to help pass spending reforms on government programs like Social Security and Medicare . But the campaign did not say how much each of those proposals would generate . When Obama announced his health care plan in May his campaign said he could pay for it by rolling back several Bush tax cuts that benefit the wealthy . That included restoring the top rate on investments to pre Bush levels twenty percent for capital gains and thirty nine point six percent for dividends . That much is clear after the former Republican primary candidate announced his stance on the bill on Thursday . Rubio says he will not vote for the final GOP tax bill unless it includes an expansion of the child tax credit more on what exactly that means below . More specifically Sen. Rubio wants to increase the amount of the tax credit that is refundable . HOOK Senator McCain you are talking about making the tax cuts permanent . And as Governor Romney pointed out before you opposed the Bush tax cuts the first time around . Now more recently you have been saying that the reason why you opposed the tax cuts at first was because they were not offset by spending cuts . To try to kick the can to a future Congress . Finally there is a fairly simple political argument that Republicans can make to defend the sunset of the individual tax cuts Congress would never let it happen . Hatch and the GOP are banking that a future Congress would not allow the tax breaks to go away when they come up in two thousand and twenty five effectively enacting a tax increase on millions of Americans but pass a bill to extend these cuts .
